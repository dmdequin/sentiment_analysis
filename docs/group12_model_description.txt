Model Description:
We used regex to tokenize the reviews and summaries, which are concatenated together. This was fed into BERT to get the embeddings. The embedded reviews were fed into a FF neural network to arrive at the predictions. The neural network has a single hidden layer using ReLu as the activation function. The model uses cross entropy to compute the loss.
