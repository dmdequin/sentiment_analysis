Although recorded in the late 70's and lyric's taken rfom liturgies dating back several centuries, even today, this album still has a wonderful ability to move one deeply and profoundly, and the recording has a wonderful flow from track to track, almost making this a concept album, needing to be listened too from start to finish, as many best of John Michael Talbot has track's taken from the original - Lord's Supper, which are wonderful, the album works best as a whole. If you ar elooking to be swept away to music and lyrics that are so profound in its orchestral arrangement, superb guitar and a choir obviously thrilled to be apart of this project, I can sincerely recommend getting this album. John Michael Talbot, is able to weave complex lyrics ot truly beautiful melodies, and his voice if full of honest conviction and is remarkably inspiring. The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled wit hold favorites and also a treat to listen too, although as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful. As I said it has been some years since I listened to this album, adn although it has been 20 something years, putting this CD on, just swept me away and it is for me as wonderful today as it was when I first heard it\",\n",

Containing -22 tracks- this compilation of Catholic worship and praise musci contains many of the essential Talbot songs that made the name John Michael Talbot a household word in most Catholic homes in the '80's.

       " 'Commentary on Luke inspires aCrd\\'s latest Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics ocver every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke. This collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement ,which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card\\'s Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gsopels will be released in each of the next three years. Card is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informe dimagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the respones that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending. Those who know Card\\'s music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commnetary, it\\'s apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane. Hsi exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity sogns, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song? \"), Christ\\'s birth \"(A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon\\'s Song\"). Jeff Taylor\\'s gentle accordion beautifullyt ies all three together. Acoustci guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It\\'s relaxed, mature nad inspiring. He employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental( \"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is fas,t but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives thees songs a Celtic feel. \"Th ePain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Chrsit\\'s followers were expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of ist own. Community is important ot Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaobration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contriubte, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew aWrd and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord\\'s Prayer. Matthew Ward\\'s contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Car dhave been singing for many years, their voices remain strong. On \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive ot the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in captruing the heart\\'s cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciat ethat he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our rfeedom. H eis the bread and wine. Card gets anyb etter than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this htat resonates deeply. Ironically, thisi s the only song that is directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound woode.n More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyricsa re personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world. I welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life thye contain. It\\'s hard to appreciateh ow artful Michael Card is with these texts. eBst of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the ilfe',\n",

I started playing them in the car for my son (9) and daughter( 12). The words were too difficult for them, but the material on the CD got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was reltaed to the author\\'s dating/sex life, or just sex in general. My kids said that they only remembered the stories and the worsd. After going throuhg the first CD, I was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate. I got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious cnotent to censor. I listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness I quit when I did because she started talking about this date she had in high scholo where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach! I guess I\\'m lik emy kids because I remember what word she was trying to teach us, but I sure remember the story. When the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author, Ms. Mazur replied that she thinks the content was any worse than what is on television - well, she\\'s right, but television in 2007 is aw hole lot different than \"I Love Lucy.\" I would even use this for an older child in high school because it is juts trashy.

       " 'Represented as something other than what it isT he reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it\\'s represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it \"really\" sounds like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket. That is what this recording i.s The \"mleody\" that seemingly emerges, and the \"angelic\" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (\"TrumpilyBumpily\") and posted here on Noevmber 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down hte recording, yourself. Whic hI did. The result is itneresting, but it\\'s about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket \"sinsg\" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.) Granted, it\\'s a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by suchs accharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recordin gof crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person\\'s interest. If you have purchased this rceording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled.

       " 'HAOX HOAX! It\\'s a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a deifnite hoax. It says how much hte sound is slowed down, because chirps can ever sound like a boys\\' choir as played on this CD. Bear with em here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we\\'d still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, labeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional to human:cricket lif,e which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every miunte to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency o,f say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can hnadle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of yoru computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be three). And what does a single chirp raelly sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear th eindividual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency hcirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp). NPR reported some crickets have 8, others have 11 beats within a cihrp:\\n[...]\\n[',\n",

       " ' falis to lift your spirit! Casting Crowns has againr ecorded a fantastic CD. Each trak has a unique message that appeals to everyone and touches eve nthe hardest of hearts',\n",
       " ' wotrh the money I was really looking forward to getting this cd, but it definitely was what I was expecting. There are a couple great songs on it, but most lyricsl ack substance while seeming to try to tell you that they are imparting wisdom. Definitely music driven, but NOTl yric driven. Having said that the music is godo, but I bought it for more than the tunes. If it were in a deep discount bargain bin I might buy it again, but probably ont. Peaec. ~~~amry .',\n",
       " \"Very oGod This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project. As with hteir other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound. There are several vrey good songs on this album. The album has a theme of challenging Christians t olive their faith all the time, just on Sunday mornings. There are ac ouple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers. As with their previous labums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles. 'East To West' is already in that cateogry. Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'EveryM an', and 'Slow Fade'. I would highly reocmmend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns. For those who are unfamiliar with their musci, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut. In an ycase, this is well worth buying\"]"
