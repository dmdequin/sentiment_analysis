Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game.\\n\\nExcept somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.\\n\\nCertainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

       "  'reviewText': 'Back in 1993, a little game called Myst appeared. Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness.\\nBut Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology.\\nSo how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game.\\n\"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There\\'s five CDs to the  game -- that\\'s clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes.\\nThe graphics, while nice, aren\\'t the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you\\'ll get used to it.\\nIt\\'s definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the \"Myst\" era.',\n",

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed.\\nThe graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2.\\nThe default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them.\\nOn this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter.\\nI recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Don\\'t you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall\\'s arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol\\' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom!\\n\\nGameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version.\\n\\nSound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade!\\n\\nGraphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS!\\n\\nCharacters: You get a line up of the following characters:\\n1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\")\\n\\n2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\")\\n\\n3. The Incredible Hulk (What\\'s to say, he\\'s a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.)\\n\\n4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!)\\n\\n5. Wolverine (The cheap one)\\n\\n6. Juggernaut (He\\'s huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!)\\n\\n7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\")\\n\\n8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.)\\n\\n9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn\\'t included.)\\n\\n10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.)\\n\\nOver-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can\\'t, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren\\'t for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn\\'t stop me from getting it AT ALL! GET IT IF YOU DON\\'T HAVE IT!!\\n\\nThank\\'s to Amazon.com for posting this review and YOU for reading it!',\n",

The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you. Overall, the game is great and is a definite buy for every N64 fan!\",\n",

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.\\n\\nMost people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.\\n\\nThe thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.\\n\\nAs for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Megaman Legends\\nThis is my undisputed favorite game of all time. I bought it in 1998 or so because I had played and loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mega-Man-3/dp/B00004SVS5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mega Man 3</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nintendo-NES-System-Video-Game-Console/dp/B00004SVYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nintendo NES System - Video Game Console</a>&nbsp;when I was young. This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart.\\n\\nGraphics- 7/10\\nThe transition to 3-D for Megaman isn\\'t an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game.\\n\\nStory- 10/10\\nYou are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel\\'s footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island\\'s many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates.\\n\\nSound- 7/10\\nThe music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune.\\n\\nGameplay- 10/10\\nYou play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island\\'s great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It\\'s not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun\\'s shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability.\\n\\nDifficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)\\nSince this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn\\'t that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.\\n\\nOverall- 10/10\\nDespite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it\\'s still 5 stars. The game\\'s storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn\\'t even matter. You\\'ll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This was a very chanllenging game for me it. Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert. I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist. If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Finally, after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay, Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing, and realism was becoming more important than ever.  So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I\\'m slow!\\n\\nI have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I\\'m happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.\\n\\nI\\'m surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They\\'re quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.\\n\\nI really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn\\'t let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head.\\n\\nThat led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn\\'t have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn\\'t have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily.\\n\\nMost of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn\\'t easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it\\'s possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You\\'ll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It\\'s borderline INSANE.\\n\\nYou see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!\\n\\nI think I explained myself correctly, there.  It\\'s kind of confusing because there\\'s so many things you have to collect and that\\'s the main reason I can\\'t give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who\\'s normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.\\n\\nYou have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you\\'re lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn\\'t provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.\\n\\nThe music in the game is nice.  It\\'s usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it\\'s pretty much what you\\'d expect from a Mega Man game.\\n\\nListen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle\\'s mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder...\\n\\nOnce again, the graphics.  They aren\\'t as bad as I thought they\\'d be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we\\'re talking about here) but I can\\'t bring myself to really hate the graphics because there\\'s a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children\\'s game but it\\'s not, really.  Most children wouldn\\'t be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.\\n\\nThe play control... goodness.  It\\'s definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.\\n\\nA trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he\\'s facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn\\'t blame you if you couldn\\'t figure out the controls- it\\'s not the greatest way to control a character.  I\\'m not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.\\n\\nI find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It\\'s funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.\\n\\nJust running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you\\'ll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn\\'t break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.\\n\\nMega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn\\'t allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.\\n\\nLegends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.\\n\\nThe pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn\\'t an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.\\n\\nSo with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom\\'s more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game\\'s charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don\\'t laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn\\'t anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo\\'s gaming library for that matter).\\n\\nThe other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2\\'s ending), at least Capcom didn\\'t make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it\\'s fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.\\n\\nIn the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you\\'ll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you\\'ll walk away with a overall memorable experience.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies. And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2...\\n\\nIf you\\'re into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.\\n\\nI\\'ve said it before and I\\'ll say it again, there\\'s more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it\\'s all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you\\'re moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.\\n\\nThe controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don\\'t allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There\\'s also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that\\'s just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it\\'s definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don\\'t watch yourself.\\n\\nIn my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.',\n",

Had this been the easrly 90's this gamewould have got 5 stars hands down.  But over the years, this game is aged.  Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.  Which, again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkens.\",\n",

Of course, you won't find beautiful visuals, this is piece of history, one of the first 3D fighting games ever created. It was groundbreaking for it's time, and to this day I still find it addictive.\\nEach character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.\\nIf you enjoyed games like Rival Schools, Mortal Kombat 4 or Dead or Alive, you definately need to play this.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started.\\n\\nOn its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course.\\n\\nNow, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.\\n\\nThe movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.\\n\\nOverall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.\",\n",

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.\\nBreath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.\\nSound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing.\\nHowever, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.\\nWith all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.\",\n",

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems.\\nSure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy.\\nThe random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot.\\nThe plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her.\\nThe plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits.\\nThe  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes.\\nThere  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat.\\nI've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.\",\n",

Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.\\nAs far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation.\\nAs far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.\\nAs far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it.\\nThe graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.\\nAnd finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it.\\nOverall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.\\nSolid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.\",\n",

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.  Fun doesn't begin to describe it.\",\n",

The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.\\n\\nTekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.\\n\\nFor modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.\\n\\nThe combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).\\n\\nOverall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.\",\n",

But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.\",\n",
