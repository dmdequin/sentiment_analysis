ok <SEP> ok
love it <SEP> Its awesome
"Five Stars <SEP> great, really good!"
"LISTEN & FOLLOW!!! <SEP> THANK THEE LORD FOR THIS YOUNG MAN WISDOM, I PRAY THAT THEE YOUNGER GENERATION WILL UNDERSTAND & LIVE AS HE!!!"
Love it <SEP> Andy Gibson has a good Texas music sound that I love. His voice is clear and he can be understood!
free <SEP> the music sucks only got it because it was free
Nope <SEP> Not interesting.
One Star <SEP> I didn't like this music at all
Walking Away from this Song <SEP> Not interesting.
Music <SEP> See my previous review about this music. If this type of genre appeals to you then you will probably like it but it did not appeal to my musical taste so i deleted it. It is free so you have nothing to lose to try it out!
"just not my style <SEP> not what I expected, just not my style"
One Star <SEP> Ty
Nope <SEP> Not interesting.
"Two Stars <SEP> It""s just OK."
"Not my cup of tea. <SEP> This simply was a little more bass than I prefer. While I am not angst to this style of music, I did not actually appreciate Nehemiah's approach and conviction at communicating the messages."
"Awesome! <SEP> I would say this is a classic!!
The feeling, the tension, and the excitement!
One of the best music from Marilyn Manson!
The film production team had made a brilliant decision to looking for Manson's cooperation!"
Two Stars <SEP> not for me
One Star <SEP> Not good
This is a great CD. <SEP> This CD is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  The lyrics and music are great.  This is one of those CDs that you can put in your player and let it run to the end.  This man is talented and his vocals are all on point.
"2nd Generation take over <SEP> Amazing sound, back to the roots of where the Jackson 5 started. I love this album, the second generations of Jackson's are back and putting their imprint on the world. Much Love and Support. R.I.P Michael Jackson and 3T's mother Delores Jackson! Much love and happiness, I look forward for more to come"
One Star <SEP> not for me
Four Stars <SEP> Very nice Music liked a lot Thanks
"Recommended listening for everyone who has mixed cement or concrete <SEP> ""Who wants a bucket of cement?"" A light-hearted cover of a composition first recorded by the Slim Gaillard Trio, complete with lyrics. Recommended listening for everyone who has mixed cement or concrete."
One Star <SEP> not for me
"Must I give every review a title? <SEP> Not worth the title, as it makes me instinctively think of the single of the same name by Nas, and it's not nearly as lyrically wondrous."
"I like his rap though <SEP> Not enough beats, I like his rap though."
"nice try man <SEP> i give him the thumbs up. he's a good rapper but, the beats he use are from ""unclean artist"" so the songs aren't good. like his style just needs his own beat. i love music that reads the bible. even ""Christians"" now a days rap as if they need to disrespect someone to get fans."
"Wasted Effort <SEP> I'm not looking at Nehemiah, anymore."
Do not like. <SEP> Mistake that I bought. Do not like.
Five Stars <SEP> It was a superlative piece of music. I plan to buy the full CD.
"best one i've heard <SEP> OK, so there are about a trillion versions out there now. I looked at the Wikipedia article on the piece, and this version is performed exactly as Pachelbel scored it. If that score was good enough for the composer, it's good enough for me."
gorgeous <SEP> gorgeous song...the only thing I had to order it from itunes because I couldn't get it to download from amazon.
Five Stars <SEP> Great download! used this song for my wedding.
"Beautiful, not saccharine, well articulated <SEP> I have to agree with most of the other reviewers; I'm just holding back from 5* just because I can think of a few minor improvements!

It is performed simply, without any sentimentality, and the voices are nicely balanced, especially the cello, who is admirably restrained.  Is the viola playing, or is it another violin?  Inquiring minds want to know.

Nice job, guys.  I'm sure there's a market for stuff performed in this no-nonsense, tasteful style.  Keep up the good work.

Arch"
"1 time is too much <SEP> Shut the front door and give me my money back. I was a Mel Stan until this album came out. It's horrible. She must be tone deaf. Even the heavy autotuning and and oversynthesization can't disguise how horrible her voice is. She can barely eke out the words and has no semblance of tone and pitch. Its sweet to be a love song to her hubby, but I felt really groddy with the wuggestive lyrics. I wish Amazon issued refunds on media. Save your money, it's not worth it."
"HORRIBLE AND EMBARRASSING <SEP> THIS IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS EXCUSE FOR A SINGER! THIS HOUSEWIFE CANNOT SING TO SAVE HER LIFE! BEYOND HORRENDOUS, SAVE YOUR 99 CENTS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED OMG"
"Good job Melissa! <SEP> I do not like the Housewives shows on Bravo, but I heard this song from a friend.  It reminds me of my relationship with my bf! Good job, Melissa!"
Four Stars <SEP> received in order
Terrible - Waste of Time and Money <SEP> This song is just another terrible song released by the Gorga girl.  I really wish someone would tell her that she can't sing.  I feel bad that she's making a fool out of herself day after day.
"Don't waste your money <SEP> What a waste of a dollar. Even with all the auto tune, this sucks. Melissa obviously can't sing and she needs to ask for a refund from those producers that created this song for her. They jipped her and her husbqnd out of thousands. My kid is 7, and she sounds much better. What a waste of money and time. If there was a zero rating, that's what I would give."
"Horrid Badfish Rip-off <SEP> I acquired Summertime On My Mind via compilation album, and rather than knock the entire album with various artists, I'd rather critique this song by itself.  Despite Sublime's sublime ability to take reggae classics and turn them into something magical, Kelley James has done little more than take the progression to Badfish and throw in cookie-cutter beats and rhythm.

Rather than waste your time on this overpriced summertime cliche, I highly recommend Sublime's 40oz to Freedom.  The Australian import has additional tracks for about the same price as the US version, depending where you purchase it.  I got mine for $10 in the 90s.  Otherwise, spend the 99 cents on the Badfish track.

Love this album <SEP> Ive been a fan of Brendon Small since dethklok i own all three of dethalbums and the opera and i even preordered galakticon II this album is a venture away from death metal replaced with a more traditional metal sound its still equally as amazing
One Star <SEP> Did not like this CD.
great disc!! <SEP> Originally purchased discs years ago and were lost during moves...seen on Amazon and couldn't wait to replace.  Awesome band and really enjoy listening to songs again!!
"Terrible sound quality. Avoid this and buy a CD. <SEP> terrible sound quality.
mushy sound, nowhere near my LP."
Horrible. Music skips and studders <SEP> Horrible . Music skips and studders.
"Worth the Pick Up For Fans of Folk/Viking Metal <SEP> When I stumbled upon ""Wolf"" by Battlesoul on youtube- it lead to an album purchase. While I originally had apprehension buying the album Lay Down Thy Burdens- after listening to it once I am glad I bought it.

Viking/Folk metal is awesome. It just is. It isn't everyone's cup of tea though. For example- the hard core black metal music is too much for me to handle because of the discord in the musical beat itself. I think the closest I've gotten to any of that would be Behemoth or Slayer (Slayer is not black metal).

I didn't count the 2 quick wind instrument songs on this album in the scoring. There were two songs- Signal the Storm and Lay Down Thy Burdens that came out OK.- I really liked this album. Both of those songs were OK- just not enough to rank them any higher. I likes Warriors In Carrion Kingdoms, Wolf, Wisdom, Silence and Bow to None the best.

I'll give this album a 4.2/5.0 (84%). Definitely worth picking up if you like Viking/Folk metal. It's not for everybody- but it is for me. I'd recommend battlesoul."
"They really rock <SEP> Great song, and a great group. I'd love to see them perform live, but in keeping with Hassidic traditions, they only perform for female audiences.

A friend turned me on to their music, and though Bulletproof Stockings have not released much, I have enjoyed what there is.

The name of the group is a joking reference to the very heavy stockings worn by Hassidic women."
Jam On Something Else <SEP> Sounds nothing like the original song and is very short
Five Stars <SEP> Oh it definitely met my expectations.
"Not the original <SEP> Buyer beware, this is an instrumental cover only, with no lyrics. This is not the version from the TV show!"
"Love it, <SEP> So glad that I bought this Cd, This is a Cd with allot of songs that you can just spend time with God in worship and meditation, there's also a good selections of song to jam too, But over all, I love it and it was worth more than charged"
Worship Music <SEP> This album is banging from beginning to end!  Love her style as well!  Keep blessing Gods name foreverrrrrr!!! He is Worthy....
"Not bad, but not what I expected. <SEP> It's not what I was expecting. I heard 2 songs before I bought the album, and those are the only two songs that I like."
"Not bad <SEP> This is also from the movie "" A Good Year """
NO Background Vocals <SEP> NO Background Vocals. Says their are where are they?
"Great to hear a live take of this tune <SEP> Great to hear a live take of this tune, now dropped from the playlist with Simonetti's latest departure. At first not so different from the studio version, but then they shift into a metal-riff middle-eight that takes it in a whole new direction."
NOT the original artist!!!!!! <SEP> Ooops-- I accidentally bought this.  NOT the original artist.
Not Worth Your Time <SEP> Not sure who these people are but they for certain are NOT the original artists! These should be labeled as such so people aren't mislead. I'm glad I checked it out first before I got it.
"Don't waste your money !! <SEP> I was looking for some old time rock , something with a lot of artist on it . But this is crazy it's people who think they can sing and mess up great hits of the 80's ."
"Disappointed <SEP> I was not aware this would not be the original artist, don't care for remakes by copycat groups. Should have read more."
"Weak <SEP> The Movie was not that great, thought that the sound track might be worth checking out, but as mentioned from another reviewer
this cd does not represent all of the music that was in the movie, to bad ! this won't sell unitl they get it right"
"Bad Selection of Songs from the Movie! <SEP> I was looking forward to listening to the full tracks from the soundtrack, but all the goods songs did not get included in this compilation.  Who ever chose the songs for this compilation should be fired!  I really liked the song from the ""Casino Night"" scene and the song from the party scene with the bad cops and prostitutes - Jamba Coo Jamba Coo?  Where the hell were these songs! I hope there is a second compilation that rectifies this."
Love Her Music <SEP> I bought the single because it seems to be my favorite song right now. It is in my head when I go to bed and still there when I get up in the morning! I just love her sound! I may buy more of her music in the near future.
"Don't fall for it.  All songs performed by ""The Rock Masters"" (whoever they may be) <SEP> I can't believe I fell for it!  This is a collection of great songs, all performed by ""The Rock Masters"".  They are not any known version of the songs, some come close, but not a single song by the original artist.  Don't fall for it, don't purchase this!!"
One Star <SEP> Horrible!
Disappointed. <SEP> I should have looked more closely. These are all covers and not the original songs. Disappointed.
One Star <SEP> Not original singers a cheap reproduction
"BEWARE - NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS <SEP> BEWARE!!! NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!! It is not made clear that this is an album of tracks sung by cover artists, not one track is by the original artist. I feel like I have been tricked."
One Star <SEP> none
"What's The Point?... <SEP> For the life of me, I'll never understand the point of trying to mimic actual rock stars' voices for these compilations. Especially when the result is so dreadfully far from the mark! Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant, Steven Tyler, Mick Jagger, etc., simply can't be faked. At least not believably. They, along w/ Bon Scott, Alice Cooper, Ronnie Van Zandt, etc., all have distinctive vocal styles, that none but the brave should even try to imitate. The hilarious squawking here is a blunder to behold! Obviously, if you're in need of a good laugh, this is just the ticket. I certainly wouldn't pay for it though..."
"African Funkadelic devotees . . . what more could you want? <SEP> I think this is African musicians inspired by the then-new Funkadelic album, Maggot Brain.  A must-have!"
"Great Song. <SEP> Glenn Frey of the band called The Eagles , is a great singer and song writer.  I love this song and recommend it highly."
Five Stars <SEP> An old time favorite from back in the 80's hit show Miami Vice! I have always loved this tune!
Four Stars <SEP> Glen Frey at his best
Five Stars <SEP> Glenn Frey at his best...
How? <SEP> How are people saying they are liking this album as an mp3 download? Amazon says it won't be available as such until 2039!
"5 out of 5 <SEP> Fantastic.  Bert is phenomenal.
Buy this disc if you're an easy listening music buff or you just love Bert Kaempfert.
D Herbek
Bluffton, SC"
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
Two Stars <SEP> its another krank remix  not the best one though
Five Stars <SEP> Love the creativity of this single cover . Brandy doesnt need to try to hard to be revelant
"Decent Compilation <SEP> I have to agree with other reviewers that samplers generally only have a few good tracks. This particular compilation has several. I sought it out primarily for ""Pieces of Me,"" but seeing contributions by Informatik, Seabound, Mesh, Ghost & Writer, among others made it a keeper.

The Birthday Massacre's take on Skold's ""Tonight"" I thought was superior to the Anomie version (but then I'm also pretty keen on TBM lately with the release of Hide and Seek.) KMFDM's ""Amnesia"" is pretty standard fare for them, but it brings guitars along with the beats, which is nice. As you might expect the rougher edge of this compilation is found with Front Line Assembly's ""Angriff"" and Encephalon's ""The Transhuman Condition,"" which is also a danceable tune.

Adding some atmosphere, we have Seabound's contribution of ""The Escape"" as does Informatik's ""World of Wonder,"" a touching track in the same vein as their album Beyond. Makes me hungry for both of their next releases! This mix of Ghost & Writer's ""Fraud"" is fairly pared down at first, but I love the last half compared to the two versions included on their album ""Shipwrecks."" Stromkern's ""Ruin(ed)"" adds a dash of hip-hop flavor with their beats and vocals. I'm not really familiar with Dismantled, but I wouldn't mind auditioning other tracks based on what I heard here, despite the auto-tuney vocals.

Overall, the mix of sounds isn't too heavy in any one area. I would definitely recommend giving this sampler a listen."
True House Music <SEP> Old school classic.  I use to hear it at Club Some in Houston. Quite the trip down memory lane.
Four Stars <SEP> great song heavy beats
Very moving piece. I had no idea it was ... <SEP> Very moving piece. I had no idea it was a previously released work by Morricone when I heard it at the end of American Sniper. It fit the film very well!
"Highly reccomended <SEP> This album has vision, atmosphere, power, pure-unfathomable-darkness and all the elements of a good black metal/ambient album. This album is what Xasthur could only dream of accomplishing."
"Yes, a perfect time <SEP> Walking down the street I want to twirl and be put into a trance as I listen. Repeat and repeat"
"Horrible choice of music <SEP> Waste of money! Wish I could get my money back with this cd, it has a beat but not to run too!!"
"pretty, pretty good. <SEP> I bought this with the hope that I would be able to train at a certain pace. It definitely did the job. Now if only I could run faster. The music is repetitive bit that's what you want."
not able to listen to this on anything BUT amazon cloud <SEP> This was a waste of my time to download. While I love the song the download process was not all that user friendly & I can only listen to this as long as I have the amazon cloud player downloaded. Can not listen to this on my computer even with the cloud player. & downloading to save the song I PURCHASED to another spot..not happening. VERY DISAPPOINTED with amazon cloud player.
Five Stars <SEP> <NULL>
"bad script if you are wanting to build your confidence <SEP> While Rachael has a good voice, but it is too long and includes things in the induction that I totally disagree with.

Her script includes something to the effect of ""when you were younger you may have heard you weren't good enough or you were stupid"" I mean why would you want to hear those words over and over again if  you wanted to be more confident? It would hammer those words in no matter how positive her later affirmations may be."
"Too much dynamic for study and sleep <SEP> Might be nice for a spa bath, but it has a pattern of soothing and awakening that isn't my favorite. Try the samples: ymmv."
"Stay away! <SEP> Whoever this Hallmark label is owned by, they've did it again! See my review of ""The Lonesome Sound of Hank Williams"" for a previous write-up about how crappy it is.

Essentially, when one thinks MP3 download, you're at least thinking decently cleaned up recordings more than likely from the master tapes. Heck, even a good LP that's been digitally mastered sounds okay.

This recording, as well as Lonesome Sound, are sourced from a very crappy quality LP. I don't know if this company is using flea market finds and sourcing them from a USB turntable but these are horrible. I keep a sub hooked up to my system and it blends in perfectly even on LP's. When I play this, my sub starts rumbling from all of the surface noise present in the recording.

On a better note, Amazon is refunding my purchase price. Steer away from this and find it on an actual CD!"
Five Stars <SEP> Big Usher Fan. Have Been Ever Since His 1st Album Came Out.
"Early 1970's Re-Visited <SEP> For fans of the New Seekers, that very fine vocal group of the 1970's, this LP,released in September,1973, which I do not believe was ever re-released on CD,brings back the male voices of that original group, Marty Kristian, Paul Layton, and the later Peter Oliver who had replaced the late Peter Doyle who had left the New Seekers by then. With songs featuring Marty, Paul and Peter as leads showcasing their vocals, this is an interesting and well done effort released by Polydor. Marty Kristian of this group seems to be active in the sense of releasing as late as 2011 albums of demo recordings from the `1970's, available on the New Seekers web site. But for specific fans of Marty, this album features him as lead on 9 tracks, including the previously unreleased New Seekers Come Softly To Me, as well as the very impressive A Woman Grows, (which I'm surprised has not been picked up and recorded by others more recently in covers having a great deal of potential) written and sung as well as the more rocking A Midnight Woman. Indeed, Marty Kristian was and maybe still is not only a talented vocalist, but a very talented lyricists. So, if you enjoyed the vocals of the New Seekers, get this LP where you can, as you will be surprised and delighted in revisiting this early 1970's group."
"Five Stars <SEP> What traditional bluegrass should be.  Uncomplicated, well played and recorded."
She is the big fan and I know she will be delighted this weekend when she knows she can listen to ... <SEP> It is not for me ... it is for my granddaughter!  She is the big fan and I know she will be delighted this weekend when she knows she can listen to it anytime.  I can hardly wait ... Thanks!!!
"Shame on the idiot whose Idea this was... <SEP> Only because they used Dinah Shore instead of Ethel Merman, even though she never got to actually play it on Broadway.  Ethel NEVER missed a performance...never."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song
When you lose a loved ones these songs can help you focus on a ... <SEP> When you lose a loved ones these songs can help you focus on a better tomorrow knowing your loved one is with God and eternity is forever.
"Ok, no one is going to say it, ... <SEP> Ok, no one is going to say it, so I will....I'm sorry, but if you have listened to the early SM releases, this singer doesn't match up and the music is a shell of its former self.
Please return to your former glory.  I bought it all until the style and singer changed."
"Brings back memories <SEP> This is the song I played on my parent's record player for what seemed like hours many many years ago.
I have been searching for this exact song and finally found it. The song is interesting, but I am disappointed in the Amazon interface.

I had to download an additional ""cloud player"" to purchase the song and then I could only play it in the cloud. I wanted to download it to my MP3 player for my workout, but alas, no such luck.

If Amazon doesn't quickly fix the interface, I would be hesitant to buy any more MP3s from them."
Two Stars <SEP> Not what I was expecting
"Euge Groovey <SEP> The Best, I recommend you put him to the test........."
"More needle-drop trash from Hallmark! <SEP> These mp3s seem to have been made from a very bad Lp copy using a mis-tracking cartridge.

No, I didn't purchase this product thanks to the available previews. I'm surprised that Amazon would continue to sell such a lousy product.

Dankworth's big band music is definitely worth hearing if something made from the master tapes ever becomes available."
"save your money! <SEP> I think they suck bigtime. What a total waste of time ,money,etc. Give them a listen, you'll see they suck!"
"love them both <SEP> Joe Walsh has some competition on this one, love them both !"
"Stunning <SEP> Behind all the corn pone humor, Homer & Jethro were great musicians. Playing it Straight/It Ain't Necessarily Square combines the duo's two straight-ahead jazz albums and the cd is a breathtaking display of musicianship. Here Homer plays nearly every jazz chord and inversion on the planet, and Jethro shows the soloing skills that influenced everyone from David Grisman to Chris Thile. The song selection is slightly dated and there is a lack of variety (too many fast songs) in the latter half of the cd, but the playing is jaw-dropping. Hard to find, but worth the search."
Five Stars <SEP> Very nice smooth jazzy rendition of Gino Vanelli's hit.
Five Stars <SEP> Great remake of the  Daniel Amos band song.
Reviews did not mention horrible condition <SEP> All scratch several songs skip. When I looked before purchase. Reviews  did not mention horrible condition
Excellent vintage condition <SEP> The album played perfectly with minimal scratches and pops and no skips. Very pleased with this vintage record.
One Star <SEP> Was not the album pictured.
Change the samples <SEP> The samples are all the same... A warning not to drive... It would be helpful if they were samples of the actual meditation.
Stupid Ideas Of Western Mann <SEP> With Herbie Mann playing Bass Clarinet - Forget it - Go back and download the Chet Baker version instead
Alexz stuns again <SEP> This is a must have! I wish everyone knew this amazing lady and voice because she will inspire you with her words

youtube lies to me <SEP> I bought it because there was a shortcut on youtube and it forwarded me to this song to buy it... It wasn't the right song... make sure you test it on itunes before you buy it.
"HAARP! <SEP> Niereich and DeHessejung. 2 masters of dark and foreboding tech, take us on a journey into the HAARP!"
"No Such Thing as Too Much Vivaldi <SEP> Antonio Vivaldi - MUSIC FOR MANDOLINS - Acanta

Mandolin orchestras are an acquired taste and, to the casual listener, can often seem more like a novelty act than a serious endeavor, perhaps due to their association with the amateur (albeit enthusiastic) mandolin societies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
These notions of mandolin orchestras as being novel and/or quaintly amateurish are completely refuted in about the first 30 seconds of this CD, which is a welcome re-issue of a 1975 recording by the Deutsche Zupforchester (German `plucked' orchestra).
The late Siegfried Behrend organized and conducted the band, which here plays his arrangements of Vivaldi concerti for mandolin, lute and oboe and features performances by the great mandolin virtuoso, Takashi Ochi.
The result is a chance to hear familiar (cynics might say overly familiar) music cast in a new setting, without the vibrato laden sound associated with modern orchestral performance practices.
While it might require a little getting used to at first, the Deutsche Zupforchester's take on Vivaldi's music will reward the open-minded listener with a unique, often beautiful and never less than interesting listening experience.
Thanks to the people at Acanta for making this recording available again.

  Highly Recommended  91/2 out of 10  Oscar O. Veterano"
"the greatest industrial ever heard! <SEP> I've already own 2 Tumor albums but this is now the 3rd I own the tracks are good from begining to the end, my brother who also like artist is gonna love this! If you a fan of industrial, ebm, and techno i recommend you will enjoy this album."
"Amazon makes it easy. <SEP> I was new to the ""downloading songs from the internet"" thing. Amazon made it easy in every way. I would be more than happy to purchase more downloads directly from Amazon in the future. Look out world... the old people are catching up with technology!"
Mesmerizing <SEP> You think Kermit does a good version?  Check THIS out.  Beautiful.
Not sure i got my monies worth. <SEP> while Dic does a great job her.  two things are amiss. 1. the sticker shown on the jewl case from the petroleum company was not present on the item. 2. the sound has some bad spots on it like the mic shorted out or the original was copied in a hap hazard fashion. I don't think this was worth the price I paid for it.
One Star <SEP> Really bad remix
"Perfect. <SEP> It really doesn't get much better than this.  I am a huge fan of modern music, and yes - it can be difficult or even incomprehensible at times. But the piano music of Ligeti in the hands of Denk is simply perfect.  It's not going to have the pretty melodies of Mozart - it's going to be disorienting and will at times sound like Denk is wrestling the piano and the rhythm akin to a bucking bronco. But he always survives and you feel the better for having experienced it with him."
Legeti Forgeti <SEP> Terrible!  I am not a fan of modern music if Ligeti is the measuring stick.  Mr. Denk should stick with Beethoven.
Bun Down tha house <SEP> This song by Shrillex and Damian Marley was used to open most of his shows at the big festivals world wide this summer and it is a smoking hot collaboration ... and a great song to start a concert or a party with ... can imagine this tune blowing up dance floors. Excellent mix of high tech DJ and traditional reggae ... love it!!!
Good thrash from NH. <SEP> I really enjoyed this EP and look forward to more releases. Hailing from New Hampshire they crank out some pretty catchy thrash tunes. The snarling vocals remind me of Darren Travis from Sadus. Pretty solid all around. Support local music!
Wrong Audience <SEP> The best part about this recording is that the piano was in tune.  Other than that I only heard cacaphony.  I'm sure there are people that don't agree and that is perfectly fine with me; I just happen to have a narrower range of preferences.
i regret all <SEP> i can't believe i ever listened to this
One Star <SEP> This isn't the whole song!!
"Desperately Seeking Therapy <SEP> Judging from the lysergically ecstatic reviews for this album, mine will clearly be a dissenting opinion. EA obviously has a great deal of talent, but apparently doesn't have any idea what to do with it. Most of the tracks on Fight Like a Girl are well-played but hideously overwrought. She seemingly has more pretentions than Diamanda Galas, Danielle Dax, and Lydia Lunch combined. Frankly, her precursors played the psychogirl makes good shtick decades ago. EA adds very little to the Femme Fatale Suicide Crew except her classical pedigree and her veneer of steampunk electrosheen. An artist earns her lyrical pretensions by rising above what she can't overcome and finding a reason for the world's injustice and moral randomness. EA is still in the abyss of self-pity, nihilism, and misanthropy. Maybe she'll grow as an artist, but right now she's little more than Nine Inch Nails for angst-ridden teenage girls."
Fun to listen to cuz is a fun live performance ... <SEP> Highly collectible.  Cheap price.  Fun to listen to cuz is a fun live performance Miles sounds great on it and 1961 was a good sounding year for him.  Very happy w purchase for the reasons above.
One Star <SEP> Not worth the price of admission
"Hillsong as Usual. <SEP> To me, Hillsong is one of the greatest worship bands in the world. Since the days when they where lead by Darlene Zschech, their music has blessed the world. This album does not dissapoint. I especially like the first 5 tracks: Endless Light, Beneath the Waters, Cornerstone, I Surrender and Hope of the World."
"Hope!!!! <SEP> I really,really,really, love this song. The lyrics and the message behind it just takes you straight to the throne. Our sin erased were forgiven."
Wonderful! <SEP> This has got to be one of my favorite songs ever! What great talent God has given them! Praise God!
Wonderful song <SEP> Very powerful
"Pizzarelli <SEP> Having read a Wall Street Journal review (yes they review music) on this album, I had to hear the Allman Bros ""Elizabeth Reed"" paired with Wes Montgomery's ""Four on Six"".  What a natural fit.  I'm buying this one for sure."
"Earl Guthrie is a licensed joyologist! <SEP> There is a lot to like on Mr. Guthrie's debut album. The slide guitar on Forget About Me, the horns on Can' Hide It, Earl's vocal on Daisy Mae, not to mention the overall musicianship evident on each of the 11 tracks that makes this one of those rare albums you always play from start to finish. It's an instant party starter. Make Earl Guthrie and The Boxwine Prophets the house band at your next big bash!"
"Listen to the songs before you buy. <SEP> I so much like the songs on this CD. Many, if not all, have been reproduced in various versions by  a multitude of artists where their sound is mega and the track outlay is more professionally orchestrated. If you love good sound where the pedal is given a little more punch, this is not your type of mix.  I tried to like it but I couldn't just bear the poor sound quality in some songs.  Mixing of the voices and the tracks layout in the majority of songs was so remote. This is certainly not the Maranatha I grew up knowing as a household name. I am greatly disappointed in this product. I wish I could return it."
"One Star <SEP> I have `Naughty Operetta` by Billy May, and this ain`t it! Why not call it something else?"
Two Stars <SEP> not good
Very poor quality. can't even understand <SEP> Very poor quality.can't even understand it
"Awesome tribute to our Lord and Savior <SEP> When I hear or sing this song, I can totally vision when we meet Jesus 'in the air'. It is so inspiring to me. This is absolutely my favorite hymn."
"A lovely song <SEP> One night I was doing an Amazon search on collaborations featuring Lalah Hathaway, one of my favorite artists. I came across this wonderful song and purchased it."
2 Great Tastes (that taste great together) <SEP> A remix of a re-conceptualization of a re-imagined mix of spontaneous radio samples -- how can you lose?  Witty and thoughtful.
Another Timless Classic Praise & Worship Song <SEP> Taken directly from Scripture this is a timeless song of Praise & Worship and commitment to seeking God's presence.  I downloaded it to my cell phone for enjoyment anytime.
Five Stars <SEP> Thank!!!
"Amazing Single <SEP> Great song for anyone wanting to get out of an unhealthy relationship or for those who have just done so. It's just a great R&B song, even if you don't need to free yourself (smile). Lovely voice - - look out for her, she will be the next best thing after Rihanna to emerge out of the Caribbean."
Love God <SEP> This music is amazing - praising God is a state of being and these songs help one achieve a state of grace and light energy. Thank you for putting this together for us. Praise God and all that is Good!!
Not what I expected. Nothing compared to the original song. <SEP> I didn't realize this was instrumental. Mot
"The version I was looking for! <SEP> Clear, clean-sounding.  It seemed there was an abundance of the mono version, so finding it in stereo added much more detail."
One Star <SEP> Not in English
"i love it <SEP> i go to sleep every night with this app playing. I engage in a lot of warfare, and this app helps me to meditate on the word of God and silence the voice of the enemy"
Where is it? <SEP> I don't recall this book ever coming in and I really would love to have it. It's been a long time ago so I suppose its just gone now.
One Star <SEP> I didn't really dislike it. I just don't remember ordering it.
"Two Stars <SEP> where is the instrumental version of this song.
Guys pay attention. Heads up it exist."
"Beware Size <SEP> Buyer beware and ask questions. I received the 6 7/8, not the 12 inch. No way Im paying the shipping to return to the UK."
Is Jesus Your Pal? <SEP> Great song.. didn't know you could rate songs on Amazon.. first time its ever come up.
Not good <SEP> A basic sound frequency cd works beter. I usually fall asleep before The opening beach description is finished. I can't say I feel anything some sound frequencies I have heard do change the way I feel.
"Great Vintage Van Ronk <SEP> I have loved this album for nearly 50 years, since I first got it in the mid 60's.  Actually there are 2 editions: first on Verve Folkways and in stereo on Verve Forecast and I still have the original vinyl of both; (one was a gift) .There is a slight musical difference also. (I hang on to those old vinyls like grim death.)  Both have the same catalogue number(FT/FTS 3009).  His rendition of Leroy Carr's ""Midnight Hour Blues"" is an absolute masterpiece and ""Bout A Spoonful"", learned from Gary Davis, but maybe a little risqu to be The Reverend's original during those times, is a lot of fun with some nice scatting. There is also some rather eclectic stuff, ranging from W. B. Yeats to Kurt Weill.  The interview on the back is a hoot, typical DVR.  Great Album!"
"Five Stars <SEP> A good song to help me get up for work, love it. Almost as good as DVR's Random Canyon"
"Master of Folk Guitar <SEP> Dave Van Ronk is a master guitar player, and his Midnight Hour Blues is one of my favorite versions of this classic blues song."
"Best in Show <SEP> There is no group as charming as this one in all of gospeldom....that's my opinion, anyway. Midwestern novelist Garrison Kellor leads the group and intersperses the pieces with his always witty and wise anecdotes."
Five Stars <SEP> the bible is great
"What a cool song... <SEP> This song is so cool. I can't remember where I heard it, but it took me forever to figure out the title and artist name. If I ever get a chance I plan on buying the album."
"Relaxing and Healing <SEP> I heard this song at a concert and was determined to have it for my collection.  It is beautiful and relaxing, a great song to come home to or listen to at work."
One Star <SEP> Don't like it
From East Bound &n Down <SEP> I heard this on East Bound & Down.  The scene is set perfectly to the song.  I downloaded it immediately.  He voice is superb.  This is one of my new favs.
One Star <SEP> did not work
"Perfect for my simple, church wedding! <SEP> This album was perfect for our wedding. We had the ceremony in a church and neither of us had any special secular songs we wanted, so my husband googled ""piano wedding songs"" and, through Pandora and Amazon, located this album and selected songs for the family's entrance, wedding party's entrance, my entrance, the unity candle portion, and our exit! Simple, sweet, and absolutely perfect for us!"
"I love it... <SEP> I love that slow, catchy and slightly psychedelic style of Star Power. Combined with the hypnotizing video, seeing Mr Meeble getting digitalized and hovering as a hologram in front of blue lights, you get a really awesome experience! It fits perfectly into his anterior music art pieces and it's just wonderful to follow his development as an arising musician. Keep it up Mr. Meeble!"
"Horrible sound quality <SEP> Horrible sound quality! Someone unsuccessfully, tried to de-click and de-noise  and over did it. Doesn't amazon monitor the music they put out, obliviously they don't and if they do then the person monitoring these songs should be fired! Don't waste one dime on this crap! You're better off just buying a record of Sauter and Finegan they've put out some really great albums. This is not the first time that amazon has put out mp3 albums that were total crap sound wise. So listen to the samples and you'll see what I mean. Hey Amazon, if you're looking for someone to transfer records to digital, I am for hire."
Beautiful Harmonies <SEP> These guys have perfected the art of harmony - their lyrics are touching and meaningful - everything comes from the heart.  Their collaboration is certainly a gift from God.
A very good collection <SEP> I like 19 tracks out of 63.
"Not impressed <SEP> I was disappointed with all the tracks I purchased from Brainwaves Lab.  They weren't what I'd expected.  The entrainment is too loud and the music hurts my ears.  I promptly removed it from my device, as well as deleting it from my music library.  Everyone has different musical tastes; however, this piece was not for me.  I was not impressed at all."
"Gates of Delirium w/o Keyboards?!? <SEP> For folks familiar with the original ""Gates"" with Patrick Moraz, one quickly realizes what a pivotal role he played in that album after listening to this ""previously unissued"" version.  I think there was a good reason that it was kept in the can for all these years.

Jon starts it off with new lyrics which don't quite have the meter of the originals.  Particularly through the lyrical parts you miss the keyboard fills.  The mix is somewhat redeemed in the ""battle sequence"" but the guitar-sequencer counter point really made that movement shine.  Throughout there are EQ problems and EV excursions that detract from the overall composition.  Some might argue that I am just so smitten with the original that I can't see anything good with the new version.  Well, that may be partially true.  However, if *this* version came out in '75, I don't think Yes would have fared as well as they did in the aftermath of ""Tales"".  IMHO, of course;-)."
Beautiful voices <SEP> They sang very Beautifully.  I love it.
"Too Weird <SEP> I love Janice Borla, but this album is just too dated, and just over all wrong. It would have been a better album except the pro life message is just too cheesy."
"Nobody wins em all <SEP> The first Song I like by her probably the only. The song made me wanna dance ,I just like the beat ."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Merengue!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Ira and his crew never disappoint!
Va Va Voom! <SEP> This is one of those tunes that make you want to shake your bootie.  It's a great dance song!
Five Stars <SEP> im landon im fame and i love this song
"ALL THE DIFFERANCE <SEP> Listen UP !!! Grant Green JR. on guitar. The rest is all very COOL !!! Dig the Grooves. Also just to make it even better Bernard  Purdie on drums with a killer euro sax man. Light My Fire NEVER was never so FUNKY. Explosion is RIGHT. Get some Satisfaction. You've got to check this one out, cut by cut."
"You Are No Leader <SEP> When it has came down to Nicki Minaj, she has honestly been one of the worst female rappers that has ever been graced the Earth. Not just in voice, but she has absolutely no talent at all. Her songs from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded have all been terrible. Her last song Pound The Alarm was absolutely awful, and now she has proven to be a rapper with no talent in voice or connection to the soul with I Am Your Leader, the latest singer from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. She doesn't even come close to delivering, and instead has wasted her voice away from real talent. I think Nicki should consider growing up and having someone in her life to be her leader to, rather than making corny music that shows she has no talent.

Song: F"
dammm <SEP> i don't like his song thou....
"Good song <SEP> Entertaining song and fun to listen to. Not sure I would call this Christian, just inspirational secular music at best."
House of Rising Sun <SEP> Love this song!!!!!!!!!! It was my favorite song 40 years ago! It brings me great memories and I enjoy the violin and piano!
"Great song terrible sound <SEP> A beautiful song but the sound quality is terrible, a regular problem with the 'Tango Classics' series.  They've done a great job making a lot of obscure tango music available again, but in many cases, as here, the surface noise and audible scratches are atrocious. Too bad, especially as this is the only version of this beautiful song that is available as a download currently."
"it is obviously an alternate take and not good at all <SEP> Not radio version of this song, although it is Gary Lewis and the Playboys, it is obviously an alternate take and not good at all."
"Not Flying <SEP> When it has came to Nicki Minaj, she really has came out with whacked music the past few years. But when it has came down to her latest, she really made a joke of herself with Starships. For the cast of Glee, they haven't been able to shine with many songs to call their own. For their version of Nicki's Starships, it feels like it is just a tad bit better than what Nicki Minaj made of her own music. The song is definitely not one of favorite songs out there right now. I think Nicki should write something better that really appeals to everyone in voice, and then the cast of Glee can follow with something better in voice, and higher than just a starship.

Song: D-"
"an unbelievable show!!! <SEP> an unbelievable show!!! A musical, ballet, and concert blended in one by one of the most talented performance groups out there.  I got tickets for the live show, for my wife's birthday and she loved it!"
"This isn't music, its a collection of samples for artists to use in their own music. <SEP> blah"
"Don't like it! <SEP> Just hear the difference between Corynorhinus on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B003DFLZB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;and the one on here. It's hard to bear that kind of a difference!

There's no elegance, intensity, emotion. It's just not there in my opinion. Most of the songs carry theme but lack the luster."
Great Song <SEP> I love songs from young people. Used this in my grandsons Youth Football Championship Video. 5 more words required: stinks.
"Great message for kids! :) <SEP> 'Gotta Be You' is an incredible song. Also, the accompanying video (I don't think is included in this purchase) is enjoyed by my kids (10, 6, 4yrs).
Recommended by A Mighty Girl =)"
Not very pleased <SEP> Cd was delivered broken. I cant return it bc it was a Christmas gift and I don't have enough time. Not very pleased
Good but not the droid I was looking for <SEP> This is a good song and the intro to the famed High School Of The Dead series (H.O.T.D.) the music is the same but the vocals are different. It's not that she is a bad singer because she isn't. I was just expecting the same vocals as the show. Other than that great song.
"Not as good as Foreword, but still great <SEP> My favorite of her work so far is her second EP, Foreword. This, however, is still a fabulous collection of songs. It's very impressive for being created so closely by Tori Kelly herself without tons of writers, producers, and musicians. The lyrics are relatable and the music is more interesting than most pop. Got TK!"
"complex, catchy <SEP> These guys obviously poured a ton of talent and effort into this EP.  Very impressive for a debut. After two listens I am in love."
"Not the right song. <SEP> This is not Grouplove's ""Tongue Tied"". Not what I was looking for, some random song. Not pleased with this purchase."
"Not the original recording, confusing <SEP> I accidentally purchased this ""tribute"" to the original Grouplove song Tongue Tied.  I prefer the actual song as recorded by Grouplove."
"The lightest of darkness <SEP> Delicately and deliciously insinuating, resonating deep echoes of psyche folk music from the '60s to tomorrow, with a masterful command of icy warmth and shadowy light.

These songs sound gossamer at times but underneath is always something tough and sinewy; their sound and words evoke fantasy worlds rooted in the realest, strongest, most vivid human emotions.

Man and woman both speak through the singers dual voices, searching and certain, adoring and doubtful, cold-eyed and warm hearted. Sanguindrake's sonic and emotional universe is recognizably the one we live in, but shown to us more lovely and uncanny than we usually know. Sanguindrake have been for a long time one L.A. band I try to see every chance I can; now everyone gets to hear."
Great Song! <SEP> Great sound ! I loved the lyrics! I've been a fan of Adam Lambert's for quite awhile! It definitely kept me entertained!
"heard it on PLL, addicted since! <SEP> I love this song! Cuckoo is catchy and fun and great for a workout and/or party playlist. The whole album (Trespassing) is good, but this song is a must."
"The songs are good but the quality of the cd is not <SEP> The songs are good but the quality of the cd is not.  On one song the cd skips which is annoying.  I previously purchased Farmers Daughter and it also skips on certain songs.  However, Crystals voice is very enjoyable."
"i have just loved her. This CD does not disappoint <SEP> Ever since I saw her on American Idol, i have just loved her. This CD does not disappoint."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song!
"you should sale whole production of it not half of it... <SEP> you would add a book .pdf, what its go with it, so it will looks like a one product but you made for sale half of the product so it is wrong..."
"Needs sheet music, too. <SEP> Aebersold's play-alongs are great!  However, his changes aren't standard.  So, if you download an Mp3, you will need the sheet music.  Is there a way to attach a .Pdf of the sheet music to accompany the Mp3 file when you buy it?  Right now, it's only half a product."
Awesome! <SEP> This band continues to evolve with each album. This one is a bit slower then the rest but equally as heavy. If you are a fan of this band you will definitely want this album!
Fun Tune <SEP> This is a fun one for the holidays. 5/5
Sad <SEP> Kinda sad that was a picture disc and wasn't in the description
One Star <SEP> did not provide 320kbps recording.
"Not what I expected <SEP> This is supposed to be a US version and as such as I would have expected the song ""Rebels Rule' not to be censored.  It's the reason why I ordered it, so I'm really ticked-off."
Money Can't Buy Talent <SEP> i would rather listen to my leaf blower than this caterwauling. Ick.
One Star <SEP> i get no music when I play it waste of money
"The Songs on One Whole CD Were Mislabeled <SEP> All the songs on the CD cover were included on the CD, but when you put them in a CD player they were all titled wrong like one whole CD every title was wrong the song that would play would be the one of the cover but it show up as the title of another of her songs.  Just to know what was where I had to go into the properties and retitle each song."
Pretty music but the only road trip I'd take with ... <SEP> Pretty music but the only road trip I'd take with this music would be a trip in an elevator.  I'm thinking this music would probably put the driver to sleep.  Might want to re-think the title of this.
Five Stars <SEP> Great music
Sample sounds great but rest is not <SEP> There are a few very squeaky missed notes or parts where the lead instrument is not in tempo. Very disappointed.
"Broken tracks <SEP> The tracks we hoped for were interrupted and so the album was worthless to us .
These were Jerusalem and je me regrette torn
Please credit our account"
"just cruise <SEP> love this song -- so positive, catchy and upbeat. my 4yo loves it too. nice to have music the whole family enjoys."
"Jotta A is a very talented boy <SEP> Jotta A is a very talented boy, his voice is changing, puberty you know, but God blesses him so much and touched my heart so many times with his music!"
Amazing song <SEP> Kimbra is one of the most talented young artists out there. She will be a up and comer in the next few years. The album is amazing
Love her <SEP> love the song and her creativity
Didnt work. <SEP> I downloaded this file with Amazon's MP3 downloader and it didn't play correctly once downloaded.  This is the first time any Amazon MP3 has failed and all other subsequent files have worked perfectly.  Just this one.  I like the song though.
Greatness <SEP> Kimbra is undoubtedly the most talented and diverse artist to come around in some time. This song is a jam.
This isn't The Beatles either <SEP> The Cooperman do The Beatles.  Like drinking vinegar when you're expecting wine.  We were fooled by the packaging.
sucks rocks <SEP> This was a free music download so I downloaded it.  I wish I could return it and quit seeing it in my account.  It is not the type of music (if you can call it that) that I enjoy.
Ron Pope is an amazing artist!!! <SEP> I can't say enough good things about this album! I've listened to the songs over and over again and have not gotten tired of listening to his music at all! Ron Pope has an amazing voice and his lyrics are brilliant!
"LOVE IT <SEP> Kimbra has such a beautiful voice, mix it with her diverse styles, and it will be like theres a party in your ears.

She is one of the few artists who may bring today's musical values out of the dump"
"Richard Smallwood <SEP> This was the very first cd I purchased back in the 90's, when they started to put music on cd's.  It is the oldest in my library & thankfully, now music is able to be put on MP3's.  But I heard some of these songs as a kid & these songs are just as powerful today, as they were in the lates 80's & early 90's.  This cd will bless you & put in the you presence of the Lord."
Cheap but poor quality control <SEP> Visible damage on one side of the record which affects play.
No Go <SEP> Maybe it's meant to be a joke. I don't know. But it is most definitely not what I expected when I purchased it. I don't recommend wasting your time on purchasing this unless you're in for a laugh and not to actually drill and learn the dialect. I had more success listening to those around me who'd already mastered it.

"Great song, great artist <SEP> Love it!"
Your 14-yr-old sister deserves better than his ham-fisted attempts at romance <SEP> Absolutely banal. The sort of pseudo-rebel marketed to your 14-yr-old sister so she can feel mature and dangerous. Your 14-yr-old sister deserves better than his ham-fisted attempts at romance.
One Star <SEP> I don't like this music.
"PEACEFUL PRAISE AS WE RUN LIFE'S CHAOTIC RACE! <SEP> I absolutely LOVE this entire album... In a crazy world where the volume of life is always turned up to decibels that are deafening- along comes music like this to give perspective and rest for our hearts and actually serve as a soundtrack to allow our souls to reflect. As Believers, we are always told to be with God- but we are often so busy doing things for God that we miss the miracle of what happens when we get quiet in His presence. This CD will help you slow down and breathe and say Selah and be reminded that God loves you more for who you are than what you do! The songs are classics- each and every one and the musicians bring a reverent excellence to each track. My favorite is ""Praise The Lord He Never Changes,"" a song I first heard Evie do back in the day- but have never forgotten it and was delighted to see it included in this presentation.  BUY THIS ALBUM! I did and I have had it on ever since!"
Very Good Music <SEP> this is a very unique and one of a kind compilation mix I can listen to it over and over
After A Long Time by Baek Ji Young - Perfect! <SEP> Wow! The Smooth vocals of Baek Ji Young is soothing to my soul. A perfect addition to heal my soul... A job well done.
"A Primer for Jazz n' Samba <SEP> Another reworking of the concept of marrying the diverse styles of Jazz and Samba. Competent performances, but uninspired arrangements. render this recording a primer, at best."
"True LA 80's rock band. If you can find ... <SEP> True LA 80's rock band.  If you can find any of their records grab 'em. They are hard to find, and you will wonder why you haven't been listening to these guys!"
My ears are happy!!! <SEP> This is one awesome song!  Seems like everything Mark Tremonti puts out makes my ears happy!  You will not be disappointed.  Grab it today!  =D
"Cheerful, Sunny Galician Dances and Songs <SEP> In 1991, Milladoiro issued an album of Celtic Music from Spain; it quickly captured fans of world music through curiosity, for Galician music from northwestern Spain was hardly known. Decades past and the music oddly remains obscure. Now, Os Cemps, a very large group of musicians led by Oscar Fernndez, playing many forms of instruments, from the bagpipe to hurdy-gurdy to guitar to flutes to violins to various percussion, such as scrapers, tambourines, and drums, presents their fifth and best album, Tentemozo. The music, dance instrumentals and vocals, is bright and diverse in arrangements and moods. A blend of Celtic lilts and old Moorish elements, it reminds me of the music of Renaissance France's Provence. Here are ballads and rich, cheerful dances, such as a funny polka. The harmonies are thick and the beats are strong, producing alternating visions of courtly and festive village dances. The last track of the 42-minute long album excerpts a 1904 archived recording as introduction to a modern take of the song. In short, this album is filled with musical smiles. This is a lovingly produced album that should bring the happy Galician sound once more to the popular attention of us on this side of the Atlantic."
"Let's be honest here.... <SEP> I'm a freestyle lover, DJ, fan, supporter, critic, and whatever else u want to call it, and have been for 25 years.  This is just not great quality freestyle music. The production is descent, but most of the vocals here made me cringe.  I'm not trying to hate, because I have many friends in the freestyle industry, but those of you who are giving CD's like this 5 stars need to be honest with yourselves and the potential buyers on amazon.  Listen to any Artistik, N.S.R, After Dark, etc. album, then come back and tell me this CD deserves 5 stars.  I appreciate the effort these artists are putting in to put out new freestyle tracks, but I'm just being honest.  It is what it is."
paid version is less than 2 minutes length for each mp3 file <SEP> The paid version and the sample clips on amazon appear to be the same thing.  Was this a mistake?  If so I would appreciate the full version and then would retract my rating.  Each of the review files is less than 2 minutes in length.
"Worst version of this song I've ever heard. <SEP> I love Susan Tedeschii, and am a fan of Derek too, but they really butchered this classic Freddy Neil song.  I love the versions by Harry Nilsson and Stephen Stills, but this attempt is like trying to turn something like Over The Rainbow into a slow blues."
"Pure love and energy <SEP> This is pure Whitney Houston!
There's no need to say a lot about this LP: this is an essential of the 80's era. Young and beautiful Whitney Houston with her unique voice, passion for music and love for the Lord.

This is an original LP in a perfect condition, a real diamond in my collection."
One Star <SEP> Terrible mix.
"boo <SEP> I want my money back, this song sucks. I was looking for a different remix of little lion man and this was not it. I like techno and remixes, but this one is terrible."
"but I was disappointed. <SEP> Thought it was going to be by the original artist. It is okay sounding, but I was disappointed."
"An hour of induction, nothing more <SEP> I don't know what everyone else is talking about.  All I got was an hour-long induction to relax the body.  There was no guided imagery, no reference to the subject of abundance at all.  Very disappointing."
"Easy to Love <SEP> On a recent trip to Houston I asked the guy behind the counter at an independent music store to recommend some music that is representative of Houston. Without hesitation, he recommended this. It was a good recommendation. The laid back feel is great! I'm not informed enough to tell you what style of music it is (although I am smart enough not to mindlessly label it Tex-Mex!) but I can tell you it is easy to listen to at a bbq, by the pool, or at a small gathering of a few friends. It won't get a party started but it will sure as hell keep a great vibe going in the right situation and with the right people around you. The band members are all accomplished on their instruments and together they seem to really have a nice groove that they slip into easily.  I love music that challenges me as a listener but sometimes it's good to relax and not think so hard. There is a good chance you will like this music from the first note to the last."
good <SEP> good price
"20 seconds in and it cuts out, in an ... <SEP> 20 seconds in and it cuts out, in an audio program I can see the rest of the song if there it the audio just doesn't come through."
Five Stars <SEP> This will work your body for sure. :)
"Garbage <SEP> This is an insult to this amazing song.  This woman has the most annoying voice in history, even listening to her speak is annoying as she stays in character and over acts her speech so much.  Please stick to your own garbage and don't ruin anymore great tunes Tori.  If you can make a Nirvana song unlistenable you are pure evil!"
good stuff <SEP> Liked the song after hearing these guys on a late night talk show. I've gotten a few more songs and liked them too.
"2 Stars <SEP> As an experienced meditator and energy worker, my experience working with this album was disappointing. Compared to other meditation CDs focusing on the chakras, this one fared poor in comparison.  However, everyone's energy system is different, so what works for one or is considered pleasant, is highly variable."
"Needs more tweeting bird sounds. <SEP> Even if you like rap, or Christian music, you'll find this ""music"" to be garbage. You can listen to ""Follow Christ"" on Youtube for yourself. The canned tweeting birds sounds alone are enough to make you reach for the earplugs, even if the entire ""song"" wasn't merely a repetition of the phrase ""follow me"" ad nauseum.

Also, this full album failed to raise the needed funds on Kickstarted to be completed not once, but twice. Perhaps there's a reason no one wanted to contribute."
"Danny Wilde rocks!! <SEP> Awesome song from Danny Wilde before he went on to form the Rembrandts who of course became popular for the ""Friends"" theme song."
"One Star <SEP> Packaging did not meet my expectation by a ""Long Shot""."
"Not complete song.... <SEP> Love the song, but disappointed that it is not the full length version I used to have on cassette.  But it was only $.29 opposed to the $1.29 listed...perhaps that is why.  I would like to find the complete version on mp3."
"Only 6 Times Through and Your Songs are Tattooed on My Brain. Thanks a Lot, Eric Peters. <SEP> I'll admit, I should have bought this album when it was released in May of 2012, but I didn't.  But that's okay because it's an album of second chances and brand new starts.  So ""HA HA"" half of 2012 & 2013-- it's a brand new year!

Seriously, though, this album has hints and influences of a variety of rock and pop acts from the last 25 years (and maybe more), and they show up in the most surprising places. You may find sounds similar to The Outfield, Phil Keaggy, Bill Mallonee, Charlie Peacock, and even (momentarily) Colbie Caillat. So, in general, expect jangly, poppy guitar-driven up-tempo songs with a couple of  slower numbers to catch your breath before it starts again.

The lyrics are solid, transparent, introspective... somewhat wounded, but hopeful and optimistic.
So ""hello to the new year,"" and let's hope Eric Peters will be bringing us a follow-up album in 2014."
"One Star <SEP> Why would anyone buy this incomplete recording?  Act 1, Scene 1 (The warrant) is missing."
"Broken Case <SEP> Arrived with broken case with front and sides crushed in, it no longer will close."
Two Stars <SEP> A couple redeeming tracks but mostly just annoying noise. I should not have bought the whole album.
"Even better than their first <SEP> Evil ABounds is the second album from Canadian heavy metal band The Worshyp. This CD is awesome from start to finish. The scope of music ranges from pure thrash metal as in the days of old Megadeth and Metallica to modern heavy metal.
Diabolic - A song about a guy going postal! Hard hitting in your face thrash
Thunderman - A song about a rebel running from the law on his motorcycle. Thrash songs that mixes classic metal riffs with a modern sound.
Seven Deadly Sins - The songs is about a vampire and his newly turned vampiress wife.
The Graveyard - A neat songs sang in first person about an undead grave party. - Pure thrash classic
WarTorn - This song is about a veteran who is having trouble coping with his memories of war. Moderate paced heavy rock songs A++.
Awaken Underworld - This song is simply an instrumental into to Destroyer of Men.
Destroyer of Men - Combined with Awaken Underworld this song runs over 10 minutes in length. It is a full on classic heavy metal epic journey. This song is one of my favorites and is very progressive.
Love to Death - A semi-ballad about a man committing suicide. This song has radio written all over it and is incredible.
One Crow Sorrow - This songs shows more of the band's musical versatility. A mix of Black Sabbath and Alice in Chains but heavier.
Villains - Probably my favorite track from the album. This songs sings about the new world order and uses generic comic characters as a interesting juxtaposition to reality. Ozzy meets megadeth

I love The Worshyp's debut ""Kingdom Earth"" and was surprised to see the band release a follow-up CD the very next year."
"Audio quailty is terrible... <SEP> This video is a disappointment. The audio quailty for the US Festival portion is awful. The lead vocal is missing from the mix for half of the songs, which is a bummer because it would have been a great performance to capture. The 1987 concert footage is better but the audio quality is still fair at best. If you actually want to listen to the concert you're watching, this is not the video for you."
epilepsy <SEP> May sound crazy but I just feel I should say this. My son has epilpsey and autism and Both times used just samples he went into a siezure . as I said I know it sounds crazy.
"Excellent Woman of God Speaking TRUTH!!! <SEP> Excellent and Spirit Filled Woman of GOD!! I have a internet radio station and on Saturday & Sunday mornings, I play sermons from Holu Bible preaching & teaching Pastors, Bishops, Ministers, and more!!
  Pastor Locke sermon's are one of many of my most requested preachers."
Amazing Song!! <SEP> I love this song it is very beautiful! and the whole album is Amazing!!! Sara Bareilles writes the most amazing music
Great Workout Music <SEP> Love this song to to work out to. The beat keeps me motivated to want to continue my work outs even though it is a song from when I was very young. Oldies but goodies :)
Five Stars <SEP> great song
LOVE IT <SEP> I CHOSE THIS BECAUSE ITS AWESOME TO LISTEN TO TO CALM DOWN AFTER A STREESFUL DAY AT WORK OR SCHOOL
My all-time favorite song from the 60's <SEP> My all-time favorite song from the 60's. I remember cranking up the bass while listening to it as a kid because it had one of the best bass lines I've heard for a slow song.
my review <SEP> I love this song. This song very awesome. I like the way the beat goes in the song and the rythm of the song
Soul music <SEP> Their music feeds my soul. Can't wait for their NEXT album! The transaction was easy and the download occurred without a hitch. Thank you!
"Not for the Outcasts, Thugs, or anyone else looking for Hardcore <SEP> Not Coldside Hardcore Band, junk music"
"Spectacular! <SEP> This is very well made.
It reminds me of Christmas, Disney, and the magic of old beloved films.
I recommend this to anyone."
An album of Georgian choir music which generally reflects the eligious culture in Georgia. <SEP> This album was disappointing for me as I expected more of the traditional folk music rather than music I might hear in a church in Georgia. I think the title of this album is misleading and I was disappointed. It wasn't what I was looking for.
"Cannot Use <SEP> Purchased this hymn to use as music on a DVD with photos. The item has a verbal intro before music begins.
That was not apparent before purchase

"Pure prog-pop pleasure! <SEP> After teasing us with a proggy intro to a more pop-heavy album in ""Delicate Friction"" last year, The Mommyheads really get their prog-pop on this time with ""Vulnerable Boy"", exploring sounds we've never heard before while at the same time retaining that signature Mommyheads appeal.  But to merely label the Mommyheads as prog-pop does them a disservice, as there's lots to explore here.  This is a rare album that has both instant accessibility and rewards for repeat-listeners, something for long-time fans and for those out there who might be saying ""The Mommy-whos?""

""On A Clear Night"" kicks things off with a sparse, beautiful piano melody reminiscent of early Tony Banks.  Adam Elk's vocals come in like a lullaby, and we think we know where this is going to take us, but then the drums and guitars kick in and we're happily off in Mommyheads land, where music can be both poppy and experimental, daring and familiar.  This track links nicely with the following track, ""Gimme Silence"", continuing with a new piano theme, leading to a percussion and bass pattern that reminded me of Radiohead's ""The Raindrops"" but with warmth and funk.  This takes us to the 6/4 beat ""Science and Reason"", showing that pop, rock and prog can peacefully coexist in the same track.  Next up is the epic, wonderful ""Medicine Show"", probably the album's defining track, a fact that the Mommyheads have underscored by using part of the lyrics for the album's title.  A lovely acoustic guitar and vocal melody gives way to thumping fuzz bass and layers of keyboards and vocals bordering on chaotic, but somehow the Mommyheads effortlessly steer us through it all and we're happy to be along on the journey.

 ""My Intruder"" and ""Skinny White Uptight"" highlight the more abrasive side of the band, the former track with dark cynicism and the latter with self-effacing humor.  ""Devastate Me"" takes a sparse keyboard riff and puts some real bounce into it, ""Right Where They Should Be"" and ""Out on the Cliffs"" are classic Mommyheads.  ""Force of Will"" features a fun little keyboard trill that should sound dated but doesn't.  ""Silent Age"" has a man-on-the-corner skiffle feel to it, and ""Bleed From a Glass"" ends on a subdued note, returning to the piano themes of the early tracks.  Bonus track ""No One Gives a Damn About Your Band"" comes off as fun rather than bitter, although god knows the Mommyheads have a right to be.  As a fan I will say it's a shame that a Mommyheads masterpiece such as ""Hello Friends"" has a handful of views on YouTube while Train's ""Soul Sister"" rakes in millions.  Both are good songs but the Mommyheads deserve their recognition too!

Overall, I found ""Vulnerable Boy"" to be an ambitious, highly listenable mix.  In one sense, the first four tracks make up a complete ""suite"", and we're left breathless and wanting more.  And while the rest of the tracks are fine (and at times, great), they lack some of the sonic majesty of those first four tracks.  I get the sense that they were really trying to stretch themselves in the front end of the album.  In particular ""Skinny White Uptight"" sticks out as not really belonging here, but damned if the track isn't catchy.  And that's one of the reasons I love the Mommyheads.  As soon as you try to define them or pigeonhole them, they say ""Wait, but what if we did this?""  You end up getting the best of both worlds: invention and accessibility, in one great-sounding package.  I can't wait to see what these guys do next."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song. :)
"It's a nice, large album <SEP> As a longtime fan of the Trapp Family Singers, I found that this album had many songs (both vocal and instrument) that I had never heard from them before.  It's a nice, large album, a great compilation."
One Star <SEP> Disc 1 would not play.
Five Stars <SEP> SAME NO. 1 HIT IN POP CHARTS.
"POOR ARRANGEMENTS <SEP> The tunes are recognizable, but the arrangements are often far from what you expect if you've seen the movie. Also, the sound is blah."
Torture: A Way of Life on 24 <SEP> I condemn this song and the torture it supports.
One Star <SEP> Will not burn to CD.
"I love these guys <SEP> I love these guys. I love Queen. Win-Win. My only complaint would be track order doesn't always make sense (the introduction is halfway through and the ""finale"" is several tracks before the end of the album)."
"The music is amazing! <SEP> There's no doubt that the music is absolutely amazing. My issue isn't with the music, I LOVE IT! My issue is with the physical CD they're selling. Now... For those that buy the CD from one of the official Protomen carriers, from their website, you get this awesome case with a lyric book that's amazing and everything there is great. I loved getting the first album from them. However, I decided, well Amazon is a cheaper place to get the disc, so I bought it from here, thinking I'd get the same thing. I ordered Act II and the Night Of Queen from Amazon, and they seem to be some sort of third party burnt junk. Both CD's are identical, literally, just with the CD's name changed on their cover. They come in a jewel case you can purchase at any Staples, and the covers are two pages. The first page being the front cover with the track list on the back, and the second page is the EXACT SAME PAGE. It's astounding just how bad it is. I'm going to be reordering the CD's from the Protomen website, because that's the CD I want. Not something that looks like it's some middle schooler's first burnt CD. I'm highly upset with these purchases, and if you're looking to get the amazing physical CD with Lyric book and all that, DO NOT buy it from Amazon."
"Astounding! <SEP> My family and I love Queen, and if you'd asked us what we thought of the idea of Queen covers, we'd have cried ""Blasphemy!"" But the Protomen's reverential treatment of Queen's work is amazing. Rock Opera is their gig, and their talent shines in these excellent and loving renditions of Queen's classics. More, please!"
One Star <SEP> I did mean to download this song I was looking for P#$!y control by Prince
"Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic, upbeat and danceable tune!!!"
But didn't like this one <SEP> Huge fan of Regina Spektor. But didn't like this one.
Loved it. <SEP> Loved it....Regina never disappoints. i have all her Albums and there's not a bad one yet.  this one is as good as any.
"Very well done and a family favorite <SEP> My 3 year old loves this. This is pretty true to the text, but they have added some character narrative and songs, which add interest and whimsy. I have caught myself singing some of the songs. :) This is just really well done all around."
"This is horrible. It really is <SEP> This is horrible. It really is. It seems to me sinister (not to mention, cheap and talentless) to produce a recording of computer generated sterile voices (fake) for impressionable young children. I'm sorry but I hope parents will act responsibly by NOT allowing their children's first music to be fake sounds. Choose one of the many available Mp3s of real singers singing this classic children's song. Irresponsible, greedy record companies like this--it's a crime. They're contributing to the ongoing musical dumbing down of kids, instead of educating and enriching kids.  That's just plain soulless greed."
"This is such a great song <SEP> You Don't Love Anyone But Yourself

I saw Mozella singing this song on Jay Leno about 2 weeks ago.  I instantly loved it.  It reminds me so much of the great Motown hits from Detroit of the 1960s.  It was written be Brian Holland of the Holland Dozier Holland songwriting group of Motown fame.  Within one hour of watching Leno, I had downloaded this from Amazon.  What a cool song."
"Nice and heavy <SEP> It rocks. Nice and heavy. No lyrics, of course."
"sashasonia <SEP> I have emensely enjoyed this CD. I listen to it in my office everyday through my PA system. As a classical guitarist, I enjoy the guitar, but even more of the cello sound. Sonia also seems to be an accomplishe dsinger in her own right. She has a bright future."
"The WORST of the label DISCOS DLB <SEP> The WORST of the label DISCOS DLB, mexican edition ... beautiful tracks, but HORRIBLE like it sounds. Do Sandro a favor, don't sell this crap !!!"

It's better than I expected and I certainly got more than my monies worth!

Cool new sound"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Five Stars <SEP> Great drum and bass song!
Not my thing <SEP> Do not like it. Would return if possible. Thought it was something else. Since the kindle fire would not play the sample I took a chance. Will not do that again.
"This review is for the 2012 Japanese edition <SEP> Lousy release, a bit shocking coming from Japan that has a reputation of being the best in audio quality, all bonus tracks are ripped from vinyl as source and not original master tapes, and to add insult to injury, there is even no attempt to clean them. What a shame. If you are thinking to buy this release solely for the bonus tracks, avoid at all cost."
One Star <SEP> not explicit...
"Awesome! <SEP> I've never even heard of this guy! Where did he come from & why haven't we heard from him before? I really don't care now that he's here. This is an amazing debut, with thoughtful, catchy lyrics & funky grooves. This is gonna be my cruising cd for some time to come. It feels like Tom Petty's ""me and Del were singin/a little Runaway/I was sublime"". Chinese Wiiiiiiiinnnneeee!!! Can't wait to hear what else every boy has to say."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
One Star <SEP> Is not what I expected.  mostly organ sounds.  No sounds such as a werewolf scream ect.
"Viennie V Sparkles <SEP> Heard For You on the radio and fell in lovvveee! My sis and I had to got the EP and we've had it on replay ever since. Out of all the songs Remember Me is her fav, which is a cutesy story about a love at first site. Mine is still For You since it's perfect for the summer and really upbeat. Viennie V reminds me of all my favorite singers out there like Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry. She has that fun, pop sound and I love how my sis and I can relate to every one of her songs. Viennie V is definitely next big thing and we can't wait to hear more <3!"
"Good song, best one on album. Rest of album, meh. <SEP> I enjoyed this song so I thought I would check out the rest of the album. Meh. This is the best song, no need to get the others."
"Good idea but too Simple! <SEP> I hope that many audio Novenas will be created. These particular set of Novenas are way too simple to be useful! One would be better off, making up one's own Novena prayers i.e. ad-libeling even in you are not particularly skilled at this, then to use these, as they are so simple, as to be distracting!"
"This is HORRIBLE <SEP> There is really only one thing I have to say about this album. I can't believe someone is allowed to sell something like this. It is music composed by the group Meshuggah, yes, but it is not of quality worth buying. To put it simply, the instruments used for the making of this album are obviously MIDI. They are not real instruments, and that's why anyone who listens to this album won't notice much life or dynamics in the music -because it's made with synthesized instruments, not real ones.

I think it's nice that someone would want to put effort into making a Meshuggah tribute album, but I can't say it's, at all, cool for someone to just MIDI his/her/their way through it and put a price-tag on it.

Because it is not real instruments, and because it sounds so bland, I think this should have been something thrown on a website for free -not something someone puts on Amazon, iTunes, or any other website, for sale. I hope the makers aren't offended. This is just my opinion. I think that as a fan effort this is awesome. But there's nothing here that justifies charging for it. It's not this person's original work, it in now way supports the band, and the creator/s of this album didn't use real instruments."
it would be so nice to hear a short but adequate preview of each ... <SEP> it would be so nice to hear a  short but adequate preview of each piece of music before purchasing.  It is very disappointing to purchase a CD only to find out it does't suit ones taste and gets left behind in ones music library.
"Did not Download to my Computer. Only plays in the Cloud. <SEP> This song is great, but I can't download it despite purchasing it. I don't know if anyone else experiences this problem, but some of the things I buy on Amazon don't download to my computer. I never know what it will be, but this was one of the products, and I'm really getting tired of buying things in vain. If this happens again I will stop buying audio files from Amazon and switch to iTunes."
"A solid album <SEP> I did not know what to expect and took a chance. This has a lot of good songs including:
---Queen of California which pays tribute to Joni Mitchell and Neil Young this song has a slight Allman Brothers sound to it.
---Speak for Me calls out for new leadership / new heroes; it reminds me a lot of a Paul Simon type song; the guitar playing sounds good."
Five Stars <SEP> Love John Mayer and this song is a fave!
"Beautiful song <SEP> Love, love love this song!"
"Terrific album: gorgeous voices, superb songwriting <SEP> If you are a fan of original music that features beautiful voices and harmonies, as well as thought-provoking, lovely lyrics, this is one of those CDs to which you will become addicted. You will find yourself wishing the car ride to work was longer, just so you could listen to ""Curfew"" one more time... This band is well on its way--you will be seeing them at a club near you very soon!"
Five Stars <SEP> He was great and still is.
"Musical film <SEP> Same description as Me Against the World. Great youthful tune,  exceptional vote of confidential allegiance to career work you may desire to fulfill."
Good Song! <SEP> This is the second song I purchased from Emeli.  I like her sound and music.  She's fresh in this convoluted world of music right now.
Find a better online shop to download bought music. <SEP> Great music. But the download sucked. A better system of downloading MP3 music needs to be installed.
"Its A good song <SEP> I don't really care much for John Mayer, but i did like the song shadow days...as far as the Whole album I might look in to it...but yeah its a good song...thank you for your time..."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
"Amazon music is so clunky and frustrating if you don't have in limited! <SEP> Love the song, hate the music player. If you don't have amazon unlimited, think twice about making it your music player. So many things don't make sense. Offline music isn't automatically available online (playlists made online can be downloaded but playlists made offline can't go online so you have to switch back and forth to find them.) You can set new purchases to download automatically but expect it to fail every so often. You'll have to remove and re-download songs fairly often. I've also had one song that will not download (keeps telling me to buy it) but if I do go to buy it, it says it's in my library already. I have a request in for that error (yes maybe user error but I've tried everything I can think of, including seeing if I'm downloading the single when I bought it from an album or vice versa.) And don't get me started on what happens if you had unlimited but canceled it, your music library will be so messed up! You can clean it by removing unpurchased songs one at time but if there's a way to do it all at once I never found it. Still working on how to upload CDs to my amazon music...I'm pretty sure it's not possible. I think I'm going back to using iTunes."
Five Stars <SEP> Love MercyMe.
One of My New Favorites <SEP> Love the song - both music & powerful message!
One Star <SEP> It is not loud

I did NOT order this! <SEP> I did not order this cd. I did not rcv it yet. Hope I don't. I would like to hear it; but I did not plan on buying it.
"One Of My New Favorites <SEP> Loaded on my iPod and liking it - especially as a running ""distraction""...  Some of lyrics are more profound after you hear them a few times than they seem on the surface."
"children 18:3 <SEP> Children 18:3.. A group of 3 home schooled siblings that make good on their gift of music and their love for the Lord. This is an excellent album!  They continually rock the socks off everyone in the crowd over and over again. Young and old. Purchased this for my 14 year old. Good stuff in.. Good stuff out.. Great Lyrics, 'nuff said.. I predict these kids will someday ""go big"" if they can survive young adulthood together.:).
 I.recommend.this.highly"
"Great music; light on Christianity <SEP> I love the sound of this CD; Children 18:3 is extremely gifted. Their sound is a little harder than I usually listen to, but it really caught my ear when I previewed it. Every song isn't hard rockin', but most have some component of that in them. However, many also have a softer side to them. If you're looking for a mostly heavy, upbeat, hard rockin' CD but enjoy a touch of softer songs, this CD is for you.

Content-wise, their music is geared towards youth and young adults, however I (47) could also relate to many of their topics & themes. I especially liked ""Moment to Moment"" where he points out ""Every task before you is a challenge to succeed""; that message is timeless no matter how old/young you are. Some of their songs are a little more nebulous than I like. My favorite song ""What About Justice"" sounds great, but I can't quite figure out what it's about. It may be clear to others, and it's ok to have songs that have room for interpretation, but I like mine a little more straight forward. : )

The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that I like my Christian CDs to actually mention Jesus overtly at least a few times. To exclude the name of Jesus completely allows unbelievers or immature believers to hear the entire CD and never hear the name above all names, Jesus. To be sure, there are some Christian overtones & undertones in the CD, but this is part of the epidemic of CDs that don't name Jesus even once: Third Day, ""Revelation""; NeedToBreathe, ""The Outsiders"" & ""The Reckoning""; Brit Nichole, ""The Lost Get Found""; to name a very few. If groups like the OC Supertones & Christafari can have brilliant music, excellent lyrics, openly declare the name of Jesus, and be very successful, why don't others?

In the end I really like this CD and recommend it."
"Interminable <SEP> Amazon.com review David Anthony Hollingsworth has a written a long, erudite and persuasive review extolling the virtues of this recording and an appreciation of the opera in general; I hope I may be allowed the privilege of an open forum to disagree with him respectfully and reluctantly, insofar as I am not the least surprised by its neglect even though I heartily endorse his championing of previously celebrated French operas now fallen into desuetude.

I do not, in all honesty, hear much that persuades me this is a neglected masterpiece. It has a romantic and worthy history, being very much sui generis in content and theme, despite its partial indebtedness to Wagner, having had to be resurrected by the devotion of the composer's friend, who reconstructed the score of Acts 1 and III from memory once they had been lost in a fire.

My problem is primarily with the lack of variety and the determined portentousness of the music itself. It is beautifully scored but so monochrome in mood that after the first fifteen minutes I found myself desperate for musical relief, which finally arrived in the shape of Jean-Luc Viala's aria for the poet in paradise. For the most part, I can detect little in the way of shape or melody; the music meanders along aimlessly, shepherded by a succession of impressionistic gestures but remaining essentially moribund. It makes for a very long three hours. Of course, my reaction is very subjective and others seem to hear something I cannot, but nor can I say that the fairly simplistic human story, sandwiched between two Acts stuffed with allegorical characters representing various virtues and traits such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Suffering, really enthrals me; I prefer my moral attributes to be operatically enshrined in the depiction of real characters. Some might fairly condemn the libretto as more pretentious than anything Hofmannsthal and Strauss ever penned; certainly I'd prefer the dynamism and moral resonance of FROSCH any day.

The Wagnerian introduction is grand and slow-moving but hardly of a character to justify the conferring upon Magnard by some the title of ""the French Bruckner""; his music is far more static and devoid of momentum. True, it shares a devotional ambience and a preponderance of massive blocks of polychromatic sound with minor key cadences and this quality is intensified by the resonant acoustic of the Toulouse recording venue: the Halle des Grains.

My other reservations centre upon the singing rather than the music itself. Not that Jos van Dam is anything other than vocally superb and commanding and my admiration extends to several other singers, including the intense, vibrant Hildegard Behrens and the rich, steady Nathalie Stutzmann. However, the other French lady singers in the cast, including those who impersonate the abstract beings and Nadine Denize are generally rather shrill and blowsy, while Gary Lakes' tenor is harsh and edgy. The choir, the Orfen Donostiarra, is decidedly inconsistent, with some squally sopranos and several instances of poor intonation throughout.

As French fin de sicle operas go, this one went; I would far prefer to champion the revival of Chausson's ""Le roi Arthus"" than this lumbering and oh-so earnest work. I readily concede that others think differently but for all that I always wanted to like this opera, it left me bored."
Addicted since being introduced <SEP> My tattoo artist turned this on during one of my sessions and I have been hooked ever since.
"This Mote CD's so so <SEP> Saw Gordon in concert.  Obstacles in his life well known and respected.

BEWARE!!!!!! <SEP> This is listed as a Par Lindh Project reiease. It is not. It is a V/A overview of Program Day '98; with damn little Par Lindh Project on it to boot. If you are looking for a Par Lindh release; you are warned to steer clear.
"Amazon screws up a digital-only title with low variable bitrate files. <SEP> If you're interested in the closest thing to lossless that you can get for this album (which has never been released on CD), skip Amazon and try another digital music purveyor (like Google Play).  I was already sour on buying MP3's from Amazon for this same reason, but I figured since it had only ever been made available digitally, why *wouldn't* they have the same 320kbps files that other vendors offered?  Sadly not.  Some of the files in the Amazon package averaged 150kbps.  Seriously?  Bottom line...I will never again buy MP3's from Amazon.  At least not until they add back the file specs in the description."

"He calls the cops again.. and Again... and AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! <SEP> Ohh boy this is the cd where we really get a glimpse into the battles Ray and Peter had with the cops!! On ""I will call them AGAIN, little man!!!"" you can clearly hear Peter bicker with the police dispatcher about how Ray is coming back to get him. Again. After the cops let Ray go on the street. On ""You promised Officer London"" you get some awesome bickering between a female officer and Ray and Peter, it's possibly one of the funniest things they ever did! And... on ""I would like Raymond Huffman picked up as a nuisance!!"" you hear Peter call the cops... AGAIN.... and the whole argument starts about the dang cigarretes, and the cost of vodka from Walgreen's and who stole it!!! If you love it when they bring the cops into their problems you will LOVE this one!!

(note - new update, this one is my favorite out of them all!)"

Unexpected Surprise <SEP> Really must say that I know Milla can act but to hear her sing..I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.
"Not like preview... <SEP> I bought this song based on the preview and I am very disappointed. I thought it would only be piano, but there were several other instruments that came in at various times throughout the piece. It felt very choppy. It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting."

Truly love this song <SEP> An on time medley.  Truly love this song.
"Experience heaven on earth whilst listening to A. R. Rahman's music <SEP> The music of A. R. Rahman is a recent discovery after seeing the movie ""The Hundred Mile Journey.""
I listen to Rahman's music every day, especially ""People Like Us.""  It augments my creativity whilst drawing
or looking at my photographs.  It soothes my soul as I recover from a decision to let my lover go.  Rahman's
music is from the celestial spheres, and that is where I am when I listen."
"An Above Average Modern Drama Score That Shows Rahman's More Universal Side <SEP> To American audiences A.R. Rahman is known as the Slumdog Millionaire composer. Danny Boyle used him once again for 127 Hours and he was able to prove that he is not just an ""Indian"" composer. People Like Us is indeed an interesting choice for the composer and he does indeed demonstrate a more mature and subtle side. People Like Us is writer Alex Kurtzman's directorial debut, and he noted that music was a very important part of the film. Based off the score you can tell how integral the score is. The music is a very distinct narrative as the score flows in dramatic fashion with subtle character nuances and emotional beats.

It's really tough to make a modern un-stylized drama score without being one-note and boring. This is a character drama that is solely about the characters and their lives. There is no crazy situations or aliens or anything for the music to absorb. The score absorbes the characters and Rahman is able to mold a very nice story of it. The score works as a whole piece and must be experiences as a full listen from beginning to end. There really aren't any standout tracks that define the score. He introduces his central motif in the first track and that serves as the structure for the whole score's soundscape. The piano and guitar are the most notably featured instruments and as naturally solo instruments they add a distinct human touch to the music. As we come to the end we wrap up the subtle journey in a heartwarming fashion. Everything works out at the end of this story and while some people may find that cliche and cheesy, it does leave you with a nice feeling inside.

The score is thoroughly enjoyable and does a lot by doing very little. The tone stays pretty much the same the whole way through, and that may be my only gripe. It rarely shifts into heavy emotional territory and because of that it's hard to pick up the conflict of the story within the music. A.R. Rahman handles the whole thing very well and executes it with a uniformed touch. It may be too one-note at times, but the strength of the story in the music makes the characters very identifiable and it becomes a human story we can all feel. An above average modern drama score that shows A.R. Rahman's more universal side."
"Captures the feel of Retro games. <SEP> Maybe You'll Get Some, Maybe You Won't by Jim Guthrie was used in the award winning movie ""Indie Game The Movie"" and captures the mood and atmosphere of that film. Like the Old School or ""retro"" games that the indie game devs draw inspiration from in the film, this song captures the sense of awe and wonderment of games from the 8bit (NES) and 16bit (SNES/Sega Genesis) eras. I look very forward to more of Jim Guthrie's work."
GREAT Music this cd is popp' i had it before ... <SEP> GREAT  Music this cd is popp' i had it before some one else like this cd too i could fine  it so i had to purchase it again thx Eric Benet
Two Stars <SEP> I was disappointed with this cd. I will keep it yet there was only one song I really liked
Two Stars <SEP> Disappointing!
"Pirated CD? <SEP> The CD arrived with an ink jet printed label, not original packaging. The one song over an hour long was by a woman named Tony. It appears this was a pirated CD."
Hilarious <SEP> Most of these songs you've probably already heard on the O&A show but they are definitely worth hearing again...and again and again.
"he finally showed up <SEP> This guy has finally found his stride.  I like this song and album.  I've been trying to be a solid Eric Benet fan for years now,  but he always came up short.  This is the Eric we've always wanted"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great, timeless"
"Wrong Song <SEP> This is clearly the theme to Modern Warfare 2, not three. I own both albums and they are fantastic. This version of the song... Not so much... Buy ""Greatest Video Game Music"" by the London Philharmonic Orchestra if you want great cover of the music from Call of Duty."
I'm so glad I found it <SEP> I had been looking for this soundtrack for the longest! I'm so glad I found it!
Found LP on TV <SEP> I discovered this group on TV watching Letterman. I love the vocals and instruments. Great group with lots of power.
"Chrispy rocks! <SEP> Another good one from Chrispy.  Engage is a great presentation, variation, and, of course, dubstep.  Thumbs high bro, keep it comin strong!"
"Meh <SEP> I purchased this CD based on it's reviews, which was a mistake.  I listen to a wide variety of music (fan of Diana Krall, Alicia Keyes, Adele and many, many more - I have quite a large collection of music.)  But after I listened to this CD a few times, there was nothing that made me want to listen again, not one single track.  So I donated the CD to the library.

Listen to the short excerpts of the tracks on Amazon or a similar music sampling venue, then decide if the album is for you.  After a couple of CD's (I like CD's because I can then download the music onto numerous devices and because I'm middle-aged) purchased based on good reviews by critics and regretting those purchases, I will listen to the sample tracks before just deciding to buy, music unheard again."
amazing <SEP> its a good song about your mom and how much you love her and everybody loves their mom with all their heart
"Fans of Audra M. Should Go Elsewhere <SEP> I thought there would be more Audra McDonald and less of the other stuff on this track.  The sample was all Audra, but she is less than half the track."
"From MainlyPiano <SEP> ""Cycle"" is the second release from Japanese composer/musician/architect/sculptor/painter Takashi Suzuki, following ""Resonance"" (2011), which was named Best Ambient Album for 2011 by Zone Music Reporter and reached #2 on the July 2011 ZMR Radio Airplay Chart. Like ""Resonance,"" the music on ""Cycle"" is very soothing and relaxing ambient electronica. Although much of the music has a rather dark quality, it feels more like the darkness of infinite space or of nighttime than anything frightening or sad. It is interesting to note that Suzuki approaches his recordings in much the same way he approaches his paintings - one at a time, finishing one before moving on to the next, allowing the previous pieces to influence the ones that come next. Because of that, the album feels linear and plays as a continuous musical experience. Each of the eight tracks has been given an Episode number, leaving it up to the listener to discern what the music is ""about"" - if it is about anything specific at all. Suzuki uses a variety of keyboards and synthesizers to create this music, some of which are newer and some that are vintage. All of the Episodes have melodic passages as well as subtle rhythms and dynamics, and this music works equally well as a backdrop for quiet activities, music for relaxation, and music to get lost in. The sound quality is superb.

Because the continuity of the album causes it to play as one continuous piece, describing each track isn't too useful. If you enjoy space music, ambient music with depth and substance, and very minimalist music for relaxation, Takashi Suzuki's music is an excellent choice. Check it out!"
"Not entire songs. <SEP> This album, for whatever reason does not have the songs in their entirety.  The songs are great, their just not the complete songs.  Buyer beware."
"glad to have found this again! <SEP> this review is for the whole ablum.  i originally had this with sammy davis jr. doing the liner on the back.  i though this was a fantastic live album.  i normally don't do live albums, i actually stay away from them but, the supremes at the copa was sailing them into the big-time and rightly so.

this song - make someone happy - is fab!  diana and the girls belt this out and even the record shook on my phonograph.  this will always be my favorite supremes album and i am glad i found it on amazon.  i mp3ed my favorites and when i pley them, i found myself dancing, just like in 1965.  some memories are worth repeating!!"
Five Stars <SEP> the best song ever
Edited version <SEP> If you're expecting the full album intro for this version you'll be sorely disappointed as it's and edited version and therefore sounds like it starts right in the middle of the song.
"Terrible <SEP> It is not a review ate all, it is ONE (ONE!) question! Total misleading title and a waste of time and money."
"melodious <SEP> Soulful and melodious. The combination offlute and sitar is very nice. The raga itself is very good. Writing to fulfill the stupid requirement of ""some more words are required before submitting"""
"Don't pay a dime for this product <SEP> I don't believe that this is an official release. There are audio/videos of performances like this available for free all over the internet. This seller most likely downloaded this ""rare"" performance from a peer sharing website, burned it to CD/DVD, and wants to sell it to you for big money. Ch-ching!!!

Before you buy this ask yourself, ""Have I ever heard of this release before? Are the artists getting paid a dime for this?
Is this a BOOTLEG RECORDING?"
"NOT the REAL Mellow Yellow. <SEP> This is NOT the Mellow Yellow tune we all grew up listening to by Donovan, as I thought it was. Not only do they have a name similar to the original artists, but then they name a song as the same name as that group. I hope they get sued. This is a no lyrics keyboard New Wave piece of garbage. I was crying for it end less than half way through."
Its ok <SEP> Needs more work on the english and vocals. Its ok- recommend when he gets better in singing. I have not heard from him since song.
"not the good enough <SEP> A cover of the original that doesn't measure up. Dissapointed.
Better buy the original instead of this version of the song."
Five Stars <SEP> Great band and awesome songs.  Everyone of the songs is listening worthy.
great song <SEP> Great hillbilly tune based on a true story...
"Poor quality <SEP> I expected the track to sound just as good as the clip.  A few minutes into the track, the volume of the music became erratic, the music sounded fuzzy, and there was a lot of unrelated background noised in the track.  I deleted it from my mp3 player an hour after I downloaded it.  What a disappointment."
"Ok I'll try this time <SEP> I really love this tune but writing a serious review about it is just impossible because I don't know why I give a c***. When I see something this good with NO REVIEWS, well I just have to say something. I would describe this tune as House/Shuffle but I don't know. If you can't dance to this, start a different hobby."
Fantastic Sound <SEP> The album No Reprise is surprisingly refreshing. It has a great sound with an abundance of talent throughout the band- both instrumentally and vocally. It's a must buy. You won't be disappointed.
"Nice <SEP> If I did not like it, I would say so. What more should be said? Enough of this already,ok!?!?!
Done!"
Q and Sammy <SEP> Big Band at it's finest. No better than Quincy and Sammy together. Wonderfully recorded.
"Christian instrumental <SEP> Not interested. Not what I consider relaxing Christian music to meditate by.
No thanks, Alexa."
"The musicians do not profit from sales of this product <SEP> great music, unfortunately this product is bad news.
This album pleases me as much as any other album, and more than most, by the long-lived Chilean group Inti-Illimani.
But if you order a compact-disc version through this organization, you are getting a product which has been reproduced without respect to the composers, the management, and the publisher of origin."
"be warned! <SEP> If you order this cd on amazon.com you get a cheap copy. This is definetely not an original cd. Booklet is missing all kind of credits, a cd should offer! No production date and place. No information about musicians involved. No lyrics. Nothing. Looks like pirate copy!!! I saw an original travesura cd from south america.  It has a booklet!!!!
This is not a review about the music. The musis itself is wonderful as you probably know because if you came so far you would not be here looking for this cd if you were not interested."
"There's No Easy Way <SEP> ""There's No Easy Way"" is a masterpiece.  As a listener, it is cathartic whether you have been the one to break someone's heart or you have been the one whose heart has been broken.  Produced by Quincy Jones, both this song and James Ingram's entire album ""It's Your Night"" is a masterpiece.  Contemporary songwriters and singers would benefit from listening to this entire album, regardless of their preferred genre.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feel-to-Heal/dp/B0006DQ8VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feel to Heal</a>"
avicii <SEP> I have loved Avicii forever and appreciate Tim's music a lot! I thought I'd give him a positive review for making great music!
"Not up to the usual standards of Avicii <SEP> This song wasn't up the the standards I expect from Avicii, one of my favorite groups.  This single just didn't have much to it compared to their other works."
I liked it <SEP> Found this by accident. Listened to more but this was the only track I liked. Other songs have a good beat.
"Caught in Time, Stuck in Neutral <SEP> I was frustrated with this disk.  To me, there seemed to be no forward momentum, general lack of development.  The title of this disc, ""Caught in Time"", is therefore apt.  So is the landscape cover-photo of an iceberg.

Of course, then there is an exception.  Soundings II, as the composer says, is a study-work for the flute, providing a wide range of techniques to be practiced.  OK, that sounds like it would be a go-nowhere collection of study pieces.  But this piece seems to actually work.  To me, it appears to be a landscape study that unfolds the various moods and qualities that make a place unique and fulfilling to be in.  No, not much development, but interesting scene building.

Four To Go, ok, that set of 4 pieces seemed to stagnate as well and have no cohesion.  These also seemed to be study pieces for an instrument, in this case a clarinet, but they did not build or develop.  This was more like naked displays of one technique after another, with little concern for momentum, cohesion, or the piece as a whole.  The third movement of the piece, Caught In Time (that's the tempo instructions) is the namesake of the entire album.  And it does seem to be stuck in time, not in a good way.  The fourth and last movement, Relentlessly Yet Always Rockin' (again, the tempo instructions), was jazzy but so monotonous.  So ""Four to Go"" seemed to have it's title not in a good way.  Sort of like ""Hang in there, you just have four to go!""

And on and on the disk goes, with ""Percorsi d'anima"", Incroci"", and ""Quattro chaicchiere ed un apertivo"", the third of which presents a jazzy riff that reminds one of Charlie Brown music or Claude Bolling; in other words, derivative, a cliche.

In the last set, ""Three Songs on the Poetry of Yeats"", the music serves as the accompaniment to the voice line, and was more satisfying than the previous works.  It then struck me that this was the issue with all the pieces, save the first: they were an accompaniment to nothing, needing a lead line to get them ""unstuck""."
"Turst and Obey Mountclear Productions <SEP> The music is fine but right at the end of the song there are at least one or more notes
that are missing. It grinds on your never when you are expecting a ending to a fine peice
of music. Something happen I would like a replacement that contains thoes last notes
so I I don't have that left our feeling."
Five Stars <SEP> Classic
"gary barlow <SEP> Gary Barlow makes every song he sings wonderful, what a comeback by a brilliant performer, He is the best out there"
Five Stars <SEP> love this remix
"Love Firefly <SEP> Love Firefly and love the song, so had to downloaded it to play when feeling down. Wife loves the series and music too."
"Ok <SEP> This is not my kind of music, but I got it for free with no complaints. I don't like the sound of the singers or the beat. This song however was ok, its hard to write a review for a song because good music is so subjective to a person, bt its not my kind of thing."
Five Stars <SEP> bought for son he loves it
Rabbi III is easy to love! <SEP> Rabbi III is a wonderful album.  Without a doubt Rabbi is one of today's best musicians.  You can hear the influence of so many different genres in his music.
SUX! <SEP> This remake stinks!  I will make sure I listen to the preview of the song and be more careful when purchasing music from Amazon MP3.
Five Stars <SEP> Nice song
praise on my mind <SEP> Awesome great to praise our GOD  you should buy this it has a wonderful sound I love this song I sing it all the time
"HOLD YOU EARS KING <SEP> CAN THE KING BE PLEASED WITH THIS, SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL WOULD BE GREAT"
Five Stars <SEP> love love it
"Awesome summer fun music! <SEP> It's hard to capture the experience of seeing these guys play live, but they come close.  A real fun band that reminds me of summertime.. I hope they continue to put out songs that are as memorable as these... If you get a chance, catch them live around Chicago's local arenas.  Especially near ""Logan Square"".."
"Best Patsy song but poor quality <SEP> Very poor quality recording, too bad because this is my favorite song of hers."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great song, catchy tune."
"Sweet <SEP> This is, in my opinion, one of Your Favorite Martians best covers. I love the original, and while they did not copy it, I believe they did it justice. If you love Gotye, you should enjoy this cover."
"Fantastic music on this <SEP> Everything I was looking for in this group. Great beats, jazzy undertones with an international flavor. Fantastic!
Just wish it was on Auto Rip."
Five Stars <SEP> Lori has a beautiful voice.
Buy this CD <SEP> This band is great - rock and roll the way it is meant to be. I don't understand why they never made it big. Maybe they still will. They deserve it. See them live whenever you get the chance. They still do limited touring. Buy their CDs! I love Little Mistakes on this CD and American Muscle is hilarious. The whole CD is very good. I love it!
"Thrilled they put out another album <SEP> I have had hurts/works and 5th of july since around 2004 and really just thought they were a band I saw at a dive bar never to hear from them again.  After having songs still fresh in my head i googled the band and saw they had a new cd, and Joe had written a book (good point of view from ""real"" rock n roll lifestyle on the road"") So i instantly bought it because everything they make is great.

From the first seconds of the cd I loved it, they added some details to their sound I think in Brick and Mortar.  The music sounds more refined but still a rocking good time.  its hard to rank their music becuase nothings better than anything else...its a cd you don't skip songs on...you listen through again...and again... and again.

The best chance for a hit single from them IMHO is on this cd...not saying its my favorite song...what the general population would like...""Never could have made it without you"" is very catchy and anyone happily in a relationship can instantly relate to it.  The lyrics are great, very lovey dovy kinda song.  Thats why I could see a chance for a ""pop"" break through.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for Watershed!"
Two Stars <SEP> Not all of the original songs are on this soundtrack.
Great Soundtrack! <SEP> I Love This Soundtrack!
we are marshall <SEP> much less than what I expected. would not recommend to anyone. missing many of the more important tracks from the movie.
"Letdown. <SEP> I got this thinking it was the original release fron the TNT band back in '69. It is not. It features Tony Rojas one of the original singers from that band, but this is a contemporary merengue version of Sabre Olvidar not the real thing. be warned!"
Four Stars <SEP> Just what we wanted
Five Stars <SEP> <NULL>
Wonderful <SEP> I am a huge video game fan and this song was very beautiful. I hope there are more songs made.
icky <SEP> This does nothing for me to bring on on restful sleep.  In fact it is distracting.  I do not recommend this one bit!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Good song
Don't Buy This One! <SEP> Horrible. It skipped all through the song.
"but pretty close. And I love the song <SEP> It's not the exact version I was looking for, but pretty close. And I love the song, so I'm happy :)"
Wonderful <SEP> I am a huge Naruto fan and this song was very beautiful. I definately hope there are more songs made.
"Definite hard pass <SEP> The majority of this is very slow paced relaxation, the brief sentences more disruptive w/o soothing background music near the same decibel level, then the end minutes are just wasted silence."
Love it <SEP> I absolutely love this song and the young lady that is playing. The download came through smoothly and I have no complaints.
Great song <SEP> This is a great song and I wanted to buy the song before I bought the album. The song is great.
"Still Love This Song <SEP> I've loved this song from the first hearing more than two decades ago, and I still love it. Saga rocks!"
You'll Love It <SEP> Trust me you'll Love it!!! I'm a Christian and I think you might want to check it out at least
"Amazing! <SEP> Awesome band from from here in St. Louis! The Story is a great album, and they rock the house at every show."
Great album <SEP> This is a great album for fans of great hip hop music. Kristoff Krane makes mind blowing music. This is definitely worth buying.
This should never happen <SEP> The noisy skank that TI found should have never gotten discover. I can't wait till she is gone.
Great!!! Love every song!!! <SEP> LOVEEE THIS MIXTAPE SOOO MUCH!!! >.< I bump it ALL the time! So proud of Iggy & how far she has made it :) Also THANK YOU for making your mixtapes available on Amazon so I could download them & listen to them whenever I want! And not in YouTube quality haha ;p <3
One Star <SEP> I stupidly purchased this thinking it was the slipknot with corey Taylor.
"Hot <SEP> I like the sampling of this song, she did a great job with the sampling and the song itself it a hot song....nice flow really feeling this song!"
"It's Good <SEP> Iggy Azalea does a good job rapping in this song and the song is also very catchy, love this song!"
Horrible! <SEP> There is nothing relaxing about this!  It sounds like a creepy  wierdo tried to make some type of high tech sounds and it is mentally disturbing rather than relaxing.
I fell in love with Milada Subrtova as Rusalka in Dovrak's opera by ... <SEP> I fell in love with Milada Subrtova as Rusalka in Dovrak's opera by the same name.  This collection of arias shows Ms Subrtova's supreme skill as a vocalist and the great range of her talent.  She is a consummate psychologist who innately understands the motives and feelings of the characters she represents and her perfect voice and wide range allow her to fully express her characters to an extent that would crack even a heart of stone.  She is truly a rare talent and it is sad that her name is almost unknown among western opera lovers.
"Wonderful Song <SEP> I have heard this song many times and I think it is a wonderful song
with a wonderful message of God's love when He sent His Son to die
on the Cross so we could be saved. I have known this woman who wrote
this song for many years, her name is Goldie Vance from Oak Hill, WV. She has gone
on to be with the Lord in 1994. She didn't live to see her songs
recorded but I made a strong effort to get some of her songs recorded
and I am thankful to Joyce Summers who recorded my mothers songs. My
name is Robert Vance Sr.. I live at 219 Klaus St., Beckley,WV. God
bless all those who listen to and buy this cd with my mothers songs
on there.

"Disappointed <SEP> I love Dick Sutphen, but am totally disappointed with this ""album""  I thought I would hear Dick's full rich voice actually hypnotizing someone instead of white noise and birds singing.  I get the awakening part.  I think client would be extremely disappointed to hear noise only until the awakening.  I like to know what is being said to client when putting them in the hypnotic state.  Seems as if the client would think this was all hocus pocus unless seasoned in the world of metaphysics.  Thought at first album did not download properly."
""" most of the others a fine. Some day <SEP> While the star track is ""October Wedding,"" most of the others are fine.  Some day, I would like to understand why this group broke up, and why Mike Marshall doesn't even seem to mention that it existed."
"Why did Windham Hill let this go out of print? <SEP> Montreux's ""Let Them Say"" is a perfect example of a CD you can listen to when you don't know what you want to listen to. Montreux was Windham Hill's all-star group, consisting of pianist Barbara Higbie, guitarist Mike Marshall, bassist Michael Manring, violinist Darol Anger and percussionist Tom Miller. While ""Let Them Say,"" the group's second and final CD, was officially a New Age work, its appealing jazz-rock edge makes it much more compelling than most New Age albums, standing up excellently to repeat listening. My favorite cut is the sinuous, mysterious ""Barbara's Dream,"" but there isn't a bad cut on the album. Windham Hill should do us all a favor and put this CD back into print immediately."
Perfect Solution for Relaxation! <SEP> My daughter absolutely loves the CD! Perfect for her relaxation needs and therapy!  Just what the doctor ordered!  Thank You!
I Bowed On My Knees <SEP> Excellent version of this song. I like the blending of the two singers. I would recommend this song to anyone who enjoys Christian music.
I really enjoy Taylor's music <SEP> Very pleasant to listen to.  I really enjoy Taylor's music.
"Beautiful violin <SEP> Bought this cd along with the 2 player mode cd by only going off the samples here, have not listened on youtube.  My opinion varies between the two, however one thing that remains consistent is that the pieces featuring solo piano and violin are wonderful.

To Zanarkand and Roses of May stand out on this album.  Most of the rest of the songs though I either wish they were done with a piano as the secondary instrument, or that it would have just been left solo violin.  The violin work is beautiful on every song.  However a number of songs feature an orchestra of midi synthesizer sounds and it's distracting.  The violin sounds beautiful, the background instrumentation sounds off putting, somewhat weak, and just not up to the same par of quality as the acoustic instrument sound.

Time's Scar may be a bit too bass heavy.

Frog's Theme sounds heavily synthesized and unappealing.

Just a couple things that came to mind.

However, overall, not bad, and beautiful violin playing!

The 2 player mode album seems to be purely piano + violin for everything, and so the sound is very pleasing.  Instruments that are made for each other."
Four Stars <SEP> Very fine rendition of Elton John's production.
"Such A delight! <SEP> It is not often I get to talk about something as good and as joyful as this EP. I was told to check out Bobby Jo Valentine's music by a musician friend, something I always take seriously. And as is usually the case, the tip was a great one, and I was instantly enthralled by the pure sweetness of ""Hand To Hold"", so reminiscent of young love. Between the perfect vocals by Bobby Jo and the music, I was instantly under Valentine's power. There is such an honesty in the music, there is not a song that doesn't charm me, and makes me press play time and time again. Such a great purchase."
"Terrible <SEP> While I love this style music, I abhor the production of Back in the Day Cafe. ...synthesized music...poorly done at that. If the public would stop purchasing this thinly produced stuff, we would eventually get a decently produced song. There are too many very talented musicians that do sessions that could have made Back in the Day Cafe a product worth purchasing."
I have seen them live and WOW! <SEP> FF5 are so crazy live and this zombie it great to see them do.  Think lady gaga meets walking dead!  But LOUD!
Awesome song <SEP> Just like to hear it over and over. Great song all around. Awesome job Family Force 5! Keep it up!
"Great song, great words <SEP> I like this version better than the faster version. I think its due to the minimal instruments and the words of the song seem to be highlighted more this way."
!!!!!!!! <SEP> The song its self is life changing! you would not expect it from ff5! thank you amazon so giving me my purchase
"Allison chains: Iraheta's new album is a contrived disaster <SEP> There is a preview of Allison Iraheta's upcoming album circulating on the internet. It includes 30-second clips of all the songs and is severely disappointing. You just have to ask, ""Where did her voice go?"" It sounds nothing like her American Idol studio recordings or live performances, which were jaw dropping at times. I do not understand why record execs do this all the time with American Idol contestants. On Idol, her recordings of ""Give in to Me,"" ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" and ""Cry Baby"" (to name a few) are pure and magical, with an undeniable raw rock edge. On the new CD, with the exception of maybe one or two songs, Allison Iraheta sounds like a cheap knockoff of P!nk. Her ""voice"" goes into completely uncharted territory, and that's not a good thing -- it's a fake thing. With this generic, imitation pop music, they've taken the enormous potential this girl had and effectively flushed it down the toilet. All originality is gone; they're merely trying to create a second generation P!nk-Kelly Clarkson clone.

When ""Friday I'll Be Over U,"" a splendid track, was released, it was rumored that the reason for it being a little more poppy than expected was simply so it could get the attention of mainstream fans. We were told not to worry -- the album would be the REAL Allison. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is MORE poppy than FIBOU, and the ""real"" Allison is nowhere to be found. In fact, her voice is mostly unrecognizable. Even on songs like ""Scars,"" which is very vocal-centered without a lot of instrumentation, Allison has obviously been instructed to sing in an unnatural way, and her near-a cappella voice sounds contrived.

Shame on you, Allison, for allowing this to happen. For now, I will continue to listen to your pure recordings and dream about what could have been.

OIG"
"Great performance ... substandard conversion to SACD <SEP> Sviatoslav Richter's recording of the Well-tempered Clavier is my favourite rendition ... I prefer it to even that of Glenn Gould. So, this is not only a five-star performance, but amongst the very finest that exist, and the best that I know of. The merits of the performance are already well-known, so there does not seem any real purpose in giving such a fabulous and well-known performance a star rating. Rather, the purpose of this particular release is its transfer to SACD, apparently directly from the master tapes ... which brings one to the sonics.

These recordings were made in analogue in 1970 -1973 on a Bosendorfer at Schlo&szlig; Klesheim in Salzburg ... tuned about a half-semitone higher than normal pitch. They have always had an unusual resonant sonic ... I have seen others who have complained about it ... but I have always found the sound quite ethereal, and rather well-suited to Herr Bach. So what does SACD do for it?

The answer is .... odd things. The sound on my original redbook CD release is more raw, more natural, and oddly closer to a natural piano sound than the SACD release. The SACD version sound is sometimes clear, and sometimes muted, and it has unusual piano harmonics. Sometimes, the voicing of parts seems peculiar, or that something is missing. Or sometimes it seems that one part (usually in the mid-range) has unusual clarity, but the other parts are out of balance. The bass line is often emaciated. I couldn't understand this. Then, I listened with headphones ... and I noticed that whereas the original CD version is VERY hissy (unpleasantly so with headphones, but perfectly fine listening with speakers), the SACD version with headphones has almost no hiss whatsoever. And that, I suspect, is the clue to the problem. This is not just a raw transfer from the original analogue tapes to DSD ... Rather, it has been de-greased, wiped with disinfectant, anti-mould and decongestant. To my ears, it sounds rather like the dubious EMI re-releases onto SACD: something that has been so severely over-processed, nuked and radiated ... that the sound has become 'weird'.

For standard stereo loudspeaker listening, I much prefer my original redbook CD version: the CD version is vastly more natural and more balanced. For headphone listening, I do find the hiss of the original CD a problem, but I am not sure I would want the weird sonics of the SACD version either. Overall then, the SACD version is sadly disappointing. If you do not already have this set, I would go for the standard CD version: far less expensive, and far superior.

Presentation: 4 green Martian discs nicely presented in a standard 4-box CD case. The green SACDs are similar to those used in single-layer SHM-SACDs, but these are hybrids. The artwork design very nicely matches the original CD release I have. Notes are in Japanese, but track listings etc are in English and Japanese"
"On the fence with this one <SEP> This album is an 'arranged' album, and I used that term loosely, of the game Seiken Densetsu 2 (aka Secret of Mana). Quick Lesson: An arrangement is the adaptation of a previously written musical composition for presentation. It may differ from the original form by reharmonization, paraphrasing or development of the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure. (Thanks Wikipedia) So by that definition, that is not what this album is because it does none of those things; and yet it says 'Arrange Album' on the cover.

So what is this CD then? It is merely an upgrading of the original synthesized music, with newer synthesized music. The result: the same arrangements as the original, with better quality. In fact, when I first listened to it, I couldn't tell a difference. That is until I compared it to the original soundtrack, then I could hear the far better quality and better synth.

Here's why I'm on the fence: there are only 16 tracks on this CD. When you arrange a soundtrack this is understandable. You take a selection of tracks and arrange them, bringing new life to the songs. So in doing this, its reasonable to do a handful of songs from the original soundtrack. However, if your merely upgrading the sound, then why not upgrade all 44 tracks from the original soundtrack? Then that would make this a worthy purchase. After all, Secret of Mana had some beautiful melodies and really deserved one or the other. But this album is neither a true arranged album, nor a fully improved soundtrack. It's more of a sampling on what Secret of Mana could have sounded like if it was better synthesized.

Two Stars <SEP> Not what I wanted.
Because I got whatever I waarde ! <SEP> Perfect !!!
"OVerlooked gem <SEP> Incredibly overlooked song by FSA. Great guitar rifts, classic FSA fuzz, and Dave's almost distant singing make for one of the highlights of the album."
"A classic K-tel album from 1977 <SEP> And one of the few that hawk ""All Top 10 Hits""....and actually is!!

Unfortunately also one of the first of the K-tels that came in under 20 songs (this one has 18), but fully half are Number Ones.

Definitely one to have if the copies are in decent shape.  Remember, these are K-tel albums, although the copy I have was somewhat thicker than the ones that came before.  Many of the songs have slightly earlier fades, but there's none that suffer from very drastic editing, other than the knives they were exposed to going from the album versions to 45s, though many are also the full-length single versions.

The Repertoire:

Feels Like the First Time-Foreigner"
No cure. <SEP> Didn't do a thing for my skin picking. In fact if anything it is worse. The only good thing I can say about the CD is it's been a really good cure for my insomnia . She does have a very soothing voice.
"Did not help us <SEP> After I bought the cd for my daughter (14), the seller told me the product was not suitable for children or teenagers. This information was not on the description on amazon site. I cant evaluate the product if this is not your case, but for a tennager it did not help (she could not relax while listenning the recording)."
"Review & Request <SEP> The release ""I know the Lord has laid his hands on Me"".  It sounded great and I recommended this recording to anyone that has gone through something or feeling worthless.

The recording that I down-loaded ""It Good to Know Jesus"" did not burn to my CD player and I would like a refund of $1.29.  If you have questions call me at (386) 643-7145."
Five Stars <SEP> This album is SO special.
One Star <SEP> Skips
"not what i thougth it was <SEP> Thought this was a taste of the Southern Brotherhood sound, but found out that it was not.. Must learn to listen to the record before bying.."
"Anointed Song <SEP> Wonderful, anointed song! The song encourages you to think of the goodness of Jesus Christ and leads one right into worship. Wonderful, anointed song."
Five Stars <SEP> Playful and catchy tune - love it!
Five Stars <SEP> love it
"Love it! <SEP> Gene Pitney was one of the best overlooked singers of all time, this is a favorite of mine, but all his songs are great."
One Star <SEP> Song won't load or play
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
????? <SEP> Haven't  heard it.......because I didn't  know I bought it....hmmmm
Poor Quality Product <SEP> The cd doesn't play most of the time.
One Star <SEP> A record??  Seriously??
"empty chairs and empty tables track <SEP> I wanted the Michael Ball and Aflie Boe version, which I expected to receive from this CD. Sorry, but in my opinion, the Jonas brother just doesnn't measure up to Broadway standard."
Four Stars <SEP> Very funny
"Five Stars <SEP> Cute and catchy song, for one who does not really care for country music."
"A classic re-imagined. <SEP> Way back in 1930 George and Ira Gershwin composed and published a tune called ""I Got Rhythm"" which would become a jazz standard. In the mid 1960's a pop group from Paterson, New Jersey known as The Happenings recorded the song in the vocal group style of the day. The song proved to be a smash climbing all the way to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Thus another generation was introduced to the music of the Gershwins. This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio."
"Poor audio quality and volume, Disappointed <SEP> I just downloaded that 70's classic ""Timothy"" by The Buoys. Have to say, this is a very poor audio recording because even though the bit rate is more than adequate, the volume is super low. I was very disappointed. Fortunately, I downloaded the same MP3 from the The Buoy's album, ""Dinner Music"". That is definitely the version you want to go with if you are looking for ""Timothy"" or really any of the other songs on that album by The Buoys. The volume is great and the quality of the recording is good, too, especially considering it is 8 years older than this compilation version. Don't buy this one, go with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinner-Music/dp/B00JRZRCLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinner Music</a>&nbsp;if you are going to download ""Timothy"" or any other song from that album. Sometimes these compilation versions are poor quality, and, unfortunately, that is the case with this one! Enjoy the song, once you get it from the right place!"
"Weeping for the Weepies <SEP> The instrumental ""grocery store walkout"" is an uptempo version of The Weepies ""Somebody Loved,"" which was released 9 years earlier (2003).  I hope he is giving a portion of his residuals to the band the ""Weepies"" since he clearly ripped off the melody."
"Great Sound Track & Movie <SEP> I love everything about this movie !  What an unexpected GEM !  This isn't another big studio big budget  big disappointment.  Safety Not Garanteed has a great story, characters that one can actually care about (thanks to the great acting, writing, & casting), and of course a soundtrack that knocks it out of the ball park.  Good bye Mr. Spalding, and thank you Ryan Miller !!!!  Good things ahead for him (and everyone else behind this flick) I'm sure.  And of course I've pre ordered the Bluray in addition to the soundtrack download."
"NOT a radio hit, NOT a hit at all <SEP> I have never heard this on any radio station and I am one of those people who will always listen public radio. I won't subscribe to satellite radio, but I do listen to Pandora on the Internet sometimes. But this is not the Esthero I fell in love with over a decade ago. The Breath From Anther CD will always be a favorite, but I have been waiting for her to come back with that kind of flavor for a long time. Wikked Lil' Grrrls CD was okay. I didn't like the title track, but out of the 16 tracks on there I loved 4 of them. Beautiful Lie, Thank Heaven 4 You, My Torture, and Gone feat. Cee Lo Green. But the rest of the songs never got played more than 4 or 5 times.
This new song sounds like something Cyndi Lauper would have put out in the 80's. I bought the 5 versions of it hoping at least one of them would grow on me, but alas none have. I looked up the up coming tracks on Wikipedia and looked up most of the songs listed on Esthero's new album and I am so disappointed. They all sound like pop music, not the cool trip-hop, R&B, jazzy flavor I have come to love from Esthero like So Many Times w/Miquel, Another Great Love Gone By w/Vikter Duplaix and Shine w/Boney James. If you don't have those three cuts, download them now for a taste of Esthero with great flavor."
"POP? <SEP> Esthero came out in 1998 with the coolest sound. I guess it's dead and gone, never to return again. This sounds like she compromised what's gold and sold her soul to the Pop God. I mourn the loss of the great sound that was and always will be Breath From Another."
Groovy and fun! <SEP> It's that familiar bouncy rhythm Angie's known for and she sounds great!  Yay Angie!!!  Nice to hear a new cut from her.  Looking forward to hearing the rest of the album.
Five Stars <SEP> Great classic
Amazing music from a talented artist <SEP> Amazing music from a talented artist. My husband and I used the beginning of this song for the intro to our wedding. Great way to start our special day. Thank you for allowing us to purchase this song on Amazon. Definitely looking for more songs from this artist.
Not so dreamy <SEP> Have to do this song for a Cole Porter song.  Didn't like this version.  Singer does too much sliding from note to note.
"Luvnharmony <SEP> I have been following this group for years on You Tube and I have enjoyed listening to them. I had my tv tuned on Music Choice and I heared one of their songs and I instantly knew it was them without even looking at the title of the the song. I looked up the album and purchased it. Very happy to support The Walls family.
 Very please to know that they have an album."
Jet Life. <SEP> Jetlife classic.  A must have.
Hey Amazon is this a mistake <SEP> I really like this album but for some reason when I bought it amazon audioripped the clean version which was not what I wanted I'm wondering if this just a mistake or if I actually just bought the clean version of the album if so I will most definitely return it still a great album though
Five Stars <SEP> Good Haggard Album.
One Star <SEP> Wouldn't download
"Woah!!!  Friggin' heavy! <SEP> Well what we have here is a brutal death metal band, that is fronted by a female vocalist.  Ain't that an oxymoron.  I mean, Arch Enemy aren't really anything -they're like the ""pop"" version of death metal, meaning they ain't real death metal. But let me tell ya, Angela Gossow doesn't sound like this! This is HEAVY friggin' death metal -had I not read up on the band, I'd have thought this was a male vocalist...

The music is hyper fast, hyper heavy and even quite technical.  The production is modern in the sense that it's a newer recording but don't let that fool ya. The guitars are not wanky, mid-toned, or weak. I mean it when I say, they are friggin' heavy!  And the soloing is superb -above par.  With this type of death metal, it's harder to ""hear"" the bass -an issue a lot of bands have.  The bass does have moments and is felt but follows the guitars and song patterns rather than being a counter point -like say on Gorguts' ""Obscura"".

The drumming, is fantastic.  I mean this guy is no Derek Roddy, John Longstreth, or George Kollias BUT he does a bang up job (pun intended).  His double kick work is beyond reproach (though they're triggered) and he isn't just a double kick nut, he actually plays the kit and adds some color with splashes, chinas and bells. I would watch this guy to see if he guests on other bands albums.  Very talented.

I still can't get over the fact that this is a female vocalist. I mean, there are a lot more girls (women) in extreme metal now than ever.  I mean Jo Bench is the longest running, having been Bolt Thrower's bassist for about 25 years or so. This lady, Mallika Sundaramurthy, is just beyond finding anything wrong with her performance.  If you do, you're looking WAY too freaking hard, really. She is perfect for this. I bet had I not mentioned it, no one who didn't already know would've known. Don't take my word for it: listen to the samples.

Look, this is more for the technical brutal death metal crowd. If you're a fan of bands in the vein of Origin -then give these guys/gal a listen. Seriously, this is some good stuff!  Highly recommended!"
"Google <SEP> A+
Just google the review if you don't believe me"
"NOT the complete song! <SEP> I was disappointed with this song because it does not contain the entire song. After paying for this song, I ended up having to pay again to get the full song. If you want the full song, download UB40's Red Red Wine (12"" version)."
"Nothing new, but much of the old stuff recorded better <SEP> This was not released widely, probably because there is not a lot of new content on this album. The only reason to buy this item is for the improved recording & production quality of many of their old songs from their first 2 CDs, which really is noticeably better. Also, they expanded a bit on their megaman song in this version, which was nice."
Five Stars <SEP> I love to listen to traditional gospel music. This song reminds me of experiences of churches in the south.
"I like 5 minutes or so of a single mode so ... <SEP> I have plenty of tracks that play chord progressions.  As a beginner, I like 5 minutes or so of a single mode so I can work on arpeggios (many permutations),  rhythm, etc., nothing boring here.  Good quality backing track.  Includes a track with the foreboding sound of the Locrian mode; seems hard to find."
Fun way to learn <SEP> I love jamming to these tracks - great songs with good variety and a great band that was a deep pocket and lots of energy.  I bought the guitar  version of these backing tracks after a few hours creating my own bass lines so I could hear what their bass player did.  It was educational and I got some new ideas though I am glad I did it on my own first.
Lovely song. <SEP> Lovely song.
"""The Guy That Did ""The Horse "" ! <SEP> And I thought Cliff Nobles' only song was ""The Horse"" ! I never knew he had a voice, and a good voice at that !"
One Star <SEP> The original version is much better. La versin original es muuucho mejor.
"Wow! swedish French alt popsters Vanessa & the O's release fabulous new album! <SEP> It's been a while since Vanessa & The O's released their first wonderful album of dreamy pop La Ballade d'O but it's been worth the wait. With the 2012 release of the marvellously titled 'Stories For Watering Skies' Vanessa and her O's (Andreas Mattsson and Markus Jagerstedt this time round no James Iha or Niclas Frisk it seems) prove that the critically acclaimed debut was no flash in the pan and this second album is another classic in the making.

From the intriguingly eye catching pop art sleeve to the opening song 'Any Given Monday' you immediately get a sense that The O's care, maybe that's why it's taken so long but straight off we are on familiar territory but with a new twist. Into track 2 'Sweet Nothing' and you already know this band have not let you down and that here is another gem to be cherished and played over and over again as the debut album demanded to be and so it proves.
Yes, by the time you get to the more French electro pop of 'L""Air Entre Nous' you have already been taken on a melodic and emotional journey only 5 tracks into the record! We are hooked in once again by Vanessa's healing sensual voice drifting effortlessly between french and english with those to die for melodies and that layered, rich and dreamy production we have come to expect. It's all here,  losing nothing of the song craft or dextrous musicianship of the debut album, not at all, it's all there just as i hoped and dreamed it would be... even without the talent of a certain James Iha this time round.. although Mr Iha has doffed his cap to the O's by releasing his own version of The O's track 'Till Next Tuesday' on his new album 'Look To The Sky', another fine album to savour if you haven't already.

La Ballade d'O was my unexpected album of the century, Stories For Watering Skies had a big responsibility on it's shoulders to follow it, I didn't think it could possibly be improved upon but I can say now as I discover this album more and more the impossible is achieved.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Ballade-d-O/dp/B000FBIYMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Ballade d'O</a>"
"A real nostalgia trip <SEP> I grew up on the tunes contained on this CD, which were initially published (on vinyl LP) as two albums:  ""Sound Off!"" (US Army tunes) and ""Up Anchor"" (US Navy tunes).  I'm very glad to have found them in digital form on CD.  They brought back many memories."
Two Stars <SEP> I wish I liked this more because I love Dub Step but I just did not like it.
"How is this Steampunk? <SEP> This is high school/college pop at best. There are no steampunk attributes to this song or album.

This sounds like every other teen-pop song out there. I'm giving this two stars for unoriginality, and for mislabeling of the genre as ""Steampunk Rock""."

Five Stars <SEP> Mostly liked it
Four Stars <SEP> love his voice.
FAKE <SEP> Not the real recordings do not be fooled. Another attempt to gouge the public with substandard offerings. Shame! Everyone should complain about this shabby practice
Five Stars <SEP> Good
Five Stars <SEP> Thanks
Good song <SEP> Great song new song from an older artist. He's still got it. Great commentary on the changing world we live in.
"The Daily Might is a Cult publication of Children of God founded by Incestuous Pedophile David Berg <SEP> The Children of God / Family International purports to be a Christian organization, but it is a cult which promotes free love . Their founder David Berg (deceased) was a practicing pedophile who at one time gave the green light to his adherents to practice Adult Child sexual relations.

Here is an excerpt on a Berg - COG publication on the subject
""The only way to get free from him and his lies and his prohibitions and guilt complexes about sex is to get rid of his lies and his lying propaganda, his anti-sex propaganda, and believe the Lord and His Word and His Creation and God's Love and His freedom! That there's nothing in the world at all wrong with sex as long as it's practiced in love, whatever it is or whoever it's with, no matter who or what age or what relative or what manner! And you don't hardly dare even say these words in private! If the law ever got a hold of this, they'd try to string me up! They'd probably lynch me before I got to the jail!"" (The Devil Hates Sex, but God Loves It, David Brandt Berg, par 69)

It is purported that he has incestuous sexual relations with his underage daughter and grand children as well as other children in the cult."
"BUY ""WHAT PROFIT"" SO HOT! DWELE'S SIGNATURE SOUND! <SEP> FROM DALYCE AKA D'LYTE IN DALLAS.  Dwele is a phenomenal artist I have all of his albums and can't wait to get this album as well.  Had to get the single as soon as I heard it. I'm such a fan.  The ""What Profit"" has that signature Dwele sound that I love so much! Die hard Dwele fan @onairdivas!"
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent--No Problems--Thanks
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful upbeat 1970's classic. It'll never get old - and is such a classic love song.
Two Stars <SEP> ok
"Perfect Summer Song!!! <SEP> This song will be anyone's summer anthem  this year and years to come for sure!!! ""Bleach Blonde"" has that perfect vibe to get anyone in the best summery mood and think bright sunny thoughts. This would be the perfect song to play at parties and car stereos because it's super infectious and everyone will dance. :)"
"bummer <SEP> It didn't give me the whole song!! It just stops all of the sudden, mid line :( booo. Otherwise thus song is great."
"One Star <SEP> It wasn't the song, it wasn't sleepwalk, it was la bamba!"
"Sunset People Rip Off <SEP> I can't believe that anyone would do this to the queen of disco.
If you're looking for the real Donna, then purchase Bad Girls. Sunset People is on that cd.
You can also purchase the digital verson of the song for around a buck from Amazon."
"FINALLY, A ""Mommie Dearest"" soundtrack CD <SEP> I have wanted a soundtrack LP or CD of this movie since the first time I saw it when it was brand new.  I am so glad that at long last this CD soundtrack has been made.  It is some of Henry Mancini's most beautiful music.  It deserves to be heard over and over."
Never received this item. Instead received a music CD ... <SEP> Never received this item.  Instead received a music CD in CHINESE.
Nostalgia at it's best <SEP> I do love me some Hand Ballard and Midnighters.  Good to dance to when you're listening or doing chores.  Keeps you pepped up. LOL
cool msuic great price <SEP> I am a huge Jeremy Soule and this is a fun piece of music.  Got it for 99 cents a great price for a fun music
Remake of New Hope mini hit of the early 70s of the same name <SEP> Why couldn't they just release the original New Hope hit?  This was a remake of it and not as well done.  I guess some of these people were part of the New Hope release.  I bought the one marked as by New Hope with the same name and it was awful.  Ended up buying the record twice and neither one was what I wanted.
"all thumbs down <SEP> heard part of this mussic on a soundtrack of a Mel Gibson movie.  movie was good but cd stank.  after about 3-4 minutes I realized it was a very bad choice.  I suppose the shock value pf the movie soundtrack got me interested, but listening to the cd....naaahh.  not the music most people want to listen to.  Actually i was embarassed to play it for other people.  could call it narcotrafico music...I don't know.  but not my style of music."
"1966 Country <SEP> 1966

Country from the 60's.  Mostly forgotten, but still a timeless song.  da de da de da de da de da"
Album Review <SEP> This album is definitely the best of Kid Ink. You won't regret buying this at all. I'm very impressed by it.
Absolute Garbage <SEP> They don't play music
my way <SEP> very goodddd
"I love it more then anything <SEP> It's my and my husband's song, so yeah... I love it more then anything."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent song!
One Star <SEP> Sucks
"Catchy <SEP> This was my favorite song from Victorious. The melody was so catchy, and both Victoria and Elizabeth have great voices."
"I bought this song cause I like the song.... <SEP> I gave a rating of 2 stars because the live version from the show, sounded awesome to me, but the studio recording really didn't to me."
She won't let go download <SEP> I never got this to download so I don't have it. I have had problems downloading songs the last 3 times I've tried to with no success.
Five Stars <SEP> yes
"Simply, I just Love it <SEP> Just my taste in music, I love what I think the songs meaning is!! Plus it's gritty and hardcore. ROCK ON"
"2 different versions of this cd. <SEP> Not the version i wanted, missing two songs. #9 Inky and 1 other"
Great music! <SEP> Luther Allison...king of the blues!!!  Great music!!
"Heard it on the radio.. <SEP> As I get older I find myself likening more and more songs the first time I hear them. As such, I decided to purchase this one since I enjoyed listening to is so much. This is the best version of the song in my opinion. I am not a country music fan per se however, I run the gamut with my music tastes and I really think Kenny Cheney's voice adds a lot to this song. He and Grace Potter sing very well together."
Five Stars <SEP> This is the most awesome sone James has made. He is truly the godfather of soul
Five Stars <SEP> My Favorite song Love it.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"Love it! <SEP> Great music, needed it for a photo shoot! I still listen to it! Great song! Not much else to say!"
"Great song!! <SEP> I love Josh Turner and this song just makes me happy :) Going to his concert later this month, I hope he sings this one!"
"If you enjoy instrumental music -- especially orchestras -- and have never ... <SEP> If you enjoy instrumental music -- especially orchestras -- and have never experienced the Praise String Orchestra, you need to check them out! Maranatha Music has brought back a classic as this group apparently no longer exists. You can listen to your favorite praise hymns in a whole new way -- with soothing, perfectly orchestrated versions that you will be sure to relax to or sing along peacefully with. Rejuvenate and renew your spirit as you praise God through their music!!"
Disappointed <SEP> Disappointed.  This singer is so so. I love the way Wulang Tuoya sings it but apparently it's not available.
"Not Wulan Tuoya <SEP> Song is okay, and singer is talented, but I was hoping for a song by Wulan Tuoya, and this simply is not it."
"if you liked their first forget this! <SEP> What a major disappointment...disco style electronic drums and just a bummer from start to finish.with titles like ""I Love My Car"" don't waste the cash."
"Five Stars <SEP> Love, love, love!!"
Odie's review <SEP> She did great job singing and actingIn the movie. Think she will go far.
"One Star <SEP> It never downloaded, or at least if it did i cannot find on my android"
"bahia <SEP> Caetano has been a favorite of mine for a long time,and I hope this review will help introduce him to those whom have yet to experience this giant talent...The Barron."
"Neon Trees-In The Next Room <SEP> LOVE this song!! I'm not much for playing the same song over and over, but I could easily listen to this on repeat and not get sick of it. Love the jazz feel of it and his voice and the lyrics are so sexy! Very Recommended!"
Very Cool Album. Very Cool Album <SEP> This is a great album. too bad its out of print.  I tried to find my self an original copy but not even sergio (lead singer) had a copy
"Could Be Better <SEP> Melody-C.  Voice-C.  Instrumentals-C.  Not up to today's standards.  Our square dance caller has a version with an improved melody, but I don't know where he got it."
Pretty catchy tune <SEP> Downloaded for my son.  Pretty catchy tune
Five Stars <SEP> cool tune!
Five Stars <SEP> The message is simple but potent
"Light and Hope the Dark <SEP> I love this record. I've traveled the road of loss and grief too many times, starting when I was 7 years old. I've rarely encountered a more beautiful and honest expression of the journey ... from ""Feeling the weight of sorrow's night"" at the beginning to ""Light is breaking through"" at the end, this is a gorgeous and satisfying piece if work that truly feels like something you fall into and it carries you through difficult moments, all the way to the light that I promise you is at the end of the tunnel. This really should be in everyone's collection! Go get it, y'all."
"Great music <SEP> Saw Matthew Perryman Jones perform with the Nashville Ballet in a modern dance presentation. As good as the dance was, Jones stole the show. This is his latest album and is wonderful. It shows that he had more than just one song - Save You is his best known - and shows his maturity."
Four Stars <SEP> Very nice version.
She keeps churning them out <SEP> Mediocre effort here. Totally forgettable. Maybe a lil more effort on the lyrics & the music & the magic  may be recaptured.
Awesome! <SEP> Heard it first on Covert Affairs and had to have it.  It was easy enough to find on Amazon and with the preview I was sure I purchased the correct one.
"Title is Perfect!! <SEP> What a fun piece, named to perfection!!!"
Burnstein's music is always a winner! <SEP> A hard-to-locate CD was worth the higher price.  Excellent quality.  Play it often.
official cd single -- but only 1 track <SEP> Yes the song is Great -- but purchasing this official cd single - please note it is ONLY  1 track - there is no bonus remixes included. not sure why it is so pricey for just the 1 track -- it is a shame that no remixes were included.
"Crazy Joe <SEP> Classic Walsh.  Fishbone is based on a true story Sound like Joe to you?. Joe is sober these days and says he is relearning how to do his craft.  He nailed it.  Crazy lyrics, kick ass Walsh guitar. This whole album ( Analog Man) should be in anyone's collection.  There are a couple of songs where you will have to look at the CD to be sure that you didn't slide that old James Gand disc in by mistake.  Rock on."
One Star <SEP> Advertised as Vinyl and is actually a CD. False advertisement...
Who doesnt like this album!? <SEP> The classic SWV album.. So good.
Format <SEP> Not the right format
"True Fan <SEP> Since the song ""In this Place"" I have been a fan of Clint Brown. This song encourages me so I am blessed onceagain. Thank you."
"GREAT SOUND EFFECTS <SEP> Crowd large was a great find at Aamazon.com
with this Download help my Production company wit some awsome Crowd Sound Effects"
Five Stars <SEP> thanks for the cd@
Upcoming star! <SEP> Great songwriting craft and voice. A talented performer who I recently had the pleasure of seeing. Well worth the listen.
"Questionable.... <SEP> I purchased this cd for my Mardi Gras themed party. The party is not for a few weeks but I thought it best to listen to the cd right away. And it's a good thing I did. The cd is POOR QUALITY. In fact, I truly believe this is a ""homemade"" disc. The ""liner notes"", (if you can call them that), look like something made on a home computer. The music doesn't even sound like Fats' singing! It sounds like someone else altogether. I am HUGELY disappointed. This was a WASTE of money. At least I still have time to purchase another disc-
elsewhere."
feel good music <SEP> You don't have to be old school to like this. His voice and music makes you feel great
"The hymns are beautiful and if you have ever ridden a horse alone ... <SEP> I have been watching for years for this vinyl recording to make it to CD. I grew up listening to the Sons of the Pioneers, Roy Rogers, and all the other ""cowboy"" singers. As a child, this was my music of choice despite my parents being basically country/bluegrass. I own all the albums the Sons of the Pioneers (and Roy Rogers) put out - on CD mostly. I have this record album in its original release and it is one of my favorites. The hymns are beautiful and if you have ever ridden a horse alone in the open out in the west, you will understand the feeling of closeness with God that you will get nowhere else. My favorite hymn is ""The Place Where I Worship"", and while I have most of the other hymns on CDs, this one has not made it on at least one collection. I'm not giving up on it because surely I am not the only one who loves it. If you love the Sons of the Pioneers, you will love this album."
"Five Stars <SEP> NORTHBROOK IS GREAT,AND VERY HARD TO GET...... WHEN I SEEN IT ON AMAZON I SIGNED UP FOR DOWNLOADING!!!"
"Replicas <SEP> Exellent dance party songs from present time but not original artists. I woud not recommend this cd to anyone, because of it."
Soulful gem <SEP> Delta Rae is full of soul and depth.  Vocals are excellent.  This song is a lyrical tale of a woman who does not love the man she is with and is relating that to him.  It is a two sided tale of what that idealic love would be like and the reality of the situation. The writers regret is echoed through lyrics.  Extremely well written and composed.
One Star <SEP> Sorry
"Masterful <SEP> Amazing collection of songs and perfromances.  Song choices lending to tributes to Elis, Chico, Milton, Tom, while throughout highlighting the amazing guitar and voice stylings of Mr Bosco.

  The captivating, transcendent take of ""Agnus Sei"" with Bituca is alone worth the price of admission."
superb! <SEP> Joao Bosco just gets better with age (in contrast to many of his less fortunate contemporaries). His voice has mellowed over the years and he's mastered control of his performance.
"Not the original <SEP> If you are looking for the original with the slow build up in the middle of the song, this is not the right one.  The song is close to the original but the build up is off."
Super album. <SEP> The rocket Summer continues to make great music. He does a great job writing and puts out quality work. Buy it.
Five Stars <SEP> Great progressive house music. Great addition to any party playlist!
"One of my favorites! <SEP> Although I didn't order it from Amazon, I have this album and I listen to it all the time.  It has become one of my favorites.  It was released two days before something horrible happened to me, and it has only recently become clear how the meaning of this album's metaphor parallels my experience."
"Very Good <SEP> It is like a wedding song, but better.  Can't complain.  I like Menace to Society from Retronic Voice more.  It makes you feel like really good.  Add up with Final Count Down yummy :)."
"Mama said you won't regret it ! <SEP> This album doesn't do them justice. I saw them at CampJam a few times and they were amazing, brought everyone to the dance floor. So much soul&funk&rock all jammed into one awesome album.  Really nice guys too!"
"Great artist and great song! <SEP> Hazle has a voice that you will love, so hard hitting and passionate. I love everything she does and love her new band too."
"Metal courting hard rock. With a ballad. <SEP> Tommy Vext is a vocalist probably better known for his brief but excellent tenure with Divine Heresy; delivering both a savage and melodic vocal performance throughout the album. Fast forward five years and we came to his solo offering, Vext, with the album Impermanence.

First off - don't bother comparing his solo material with Divine Heresy. There is no comparison other than the projects sharing the metal universe. The first track, Exit Wounds, pretty much sets the stage for the EP and gives a great idea of what to expect for the next 16 minutes - and that is well-rounded, solid metal that courts hard rock.

The pacing of the EP stays relatively even until a brief break in tempo with Crush. As bands with excellent singers tend to do, the tempo is eased a bit and we get treated to something more along the lines of a ballad. But don't let me ruin the song for you with a boring step-by-step breakdown - just check it out. Depending on your tastes, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

If you're looking for something that isn't ear-blisteringly loud and powerful with four-and-a-half million BPM and is just good music, you could do a lot worse than chucking four bones at this album."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful song.
didn't listen <SEP> I never listened to this and accidentally downloaded it with a bunch of other songs. So I can't really give an effective review
"A+ <SEP> Music is very opinionated, so music reviews are dumb to me. Either way I liked it enough to buy it."
"Generic industrial meets self-indulgent goth. <SEP> Synth heavy and forgettable.
Most of the vocals are nasal and monotone.
I get the feeling you might hear music like this in a made for TV,  Goth bar scene. Overly produced and underwhelming."
"Melodies are fantastic, Jonna's vocal is strong and very emotional <SEP> A true gem of audiovisual creativity. Melodies are fantastic, Jonna's vocal is strong and very emotional."
"Watch out for Amazon Reviews <SEP> I've never seen or been associated with this item.
Watch out for Amazon Reviews!"
Love this band! <SEP> I love this music - it's current but also a throw back to the 70's.  I love it and can't wait until their new album comes out.
Long time fan <SEP> I enjoy listening to Buddy. This is a great CD and this song is right on par with his old tunes!
Refund please <SEP> Had extra input at end of song ruined the mood
"Live version <SEP> I was hoping this would be what I wanted, but instead it's not. Do not like live versions. Wish I would've paid more attention to what I thought I was getting."
"Five Stars <SEP> jazz musicians are like fine wine, better with age"
Catchy Tune! <SEP> I can't stop listening to this track!  It's catchy and it gets stuck in your brain! This was a great purchase!
"Joe Gauthreaux and Peter Barona made me buy this!!! <SEP> I have to admit that Justin Bieber's music is 180 degrees from where I am, but it is the the Joe Gauthreaux and Peter Barona Club Mix and then Joe's Dark Dub that sold me to buy the remixes.  I'm going to have fun watching others try to resist dancing and the catch themselves when realization hits.  Thanks to Joe Gauthreaux and Peter Barona, oh yes, and Justin Bieber for sure, if you hadn't recorded this they would not have remixed and sold me.  Now, let's get the party started!!!"
love this song <SEP> Heard it on a radio and knew I had to buy it.  Now I listen to it several times in a row.
Five Stars <SEP> Great Music !
Five Stars <SEP> Great track
"Great Song <SEP> I love this song, I found it a few years ago on some site and it's still such a great listen today. Always gets the energy going, also it's how I found Burn Rome Burn and they have some good stuff, shame they didn't seem to do much though."
"those are nice in their place <SEP> Gee, it's kind of hard to say anything about an hour of a pure sine wave... But, that was the point, right?  I'd been looking for a binaural beat recording that did not obscure the beat with pleasant new age synthesizer stylings; those are nice in their place, but if you are looking for a ""Pure Alpha Binaural Beats"" presentation, here it is.  ... Why not 5 stars?  A Catch-22; it's a sine wave, what can I say!"
"""Blue Jay"" by Lu Ann Simms; so difficult to get <SEP> I have been trying to purchase this 45rpm 7"" record for many years.  It's one of my favorites from 1958.  I regret very much not purchasing this record when it first came out.  As soon as this record becomes
available to purchase again, I would very much appreciate you letting me know as quickly as possible so that I can buy it and add it to my collection.  Thank you so much."
A MUST buy! <SEP> Love it! so incredibly Easy to listen to over and over again! It is my go to music while I work!
"Enthralling <SEP> There is no such thing as a bad AATT album; this is one of the best. Lyrically strong, literate and evocative of earlier medieval balladry while retaining a modernity that is suggestive of the more gothic leanings of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, or the classicism of the folkier Current 93 records. Listen to the title track and if you're not into it, it may not be for you. I think it's the best song I've heard all year, a gorgeous poem set to haunting guitar figures and cavernous underwater drums."
"I LOVE this band <SEP> I LOVE this band, and I LOVE this album. But the first song on side A jumped all over. I ordered a second one, and the same thing happened. Very dissapointed with this."
One Star <SEP> never again
Love it <SEP> Love this album
Amazing song <SEP> It was everything i had hoped for from the former David Crowder Band. Mellow yet rockin at the end. Reallly lifts your spirits.
It's ok <SEP> I like the way that David Crowder Band makes it sound. The music and voices by this group was just ok.
"Going Out Again <SEP> When it has came down Jennifer Lopez, it has seemed she not only lost her way in voice, she doesn't even want to come back to Earth either. After her departure from American Idol and moving on and playing fastlove into another relationship, she hasn't really learned her lessons. When it has came down to her music, she needs to learn a lesson about not trying to make the same kind of song all the time. If it goes around too much, people will stop listening to it. Her latest single, Goin' In from the film Step Up: Revolution, also off of her greatest hits album Dance Again is absolutely awful. It really is one of her worse songs she has ever made. I think Jennifer needs to stop for herself and find her voice again, but knowing her she won't and she'll keep making awful songs.

Song: D-"
more like whale sound <SEP> it seems like it's only 20 seconds of whale sounds and then it just repeats the same thing. cmon now.
This song is NOT an instrumental. <SEP> This song is not an instrumental.  The description was misleading. It contains vocals sung by a male. It's a nice song but it is not what I was needing.
Returned it. <SEP> Wow.  This was NOT Reiki Music with bell every 3 minutes.  There were NO BELLS - how can they advertise it when it has not bells?
Wrong rendition <SEP> did not enjoy this rendition of Praise Him...clicked on the wrong song. I did purchase the other two intended versions....
"Here's why <SEP> I actually like the music, just hate that it accidentally got billed to my card, because my husband must of clicked on it about three times, and it billed it to me and to him, we got two copies which we don't need also.  I think we need to have an additional step that gives you a chance to check that you are useing the correct card."
"Love the song <SEP> I love listening to the song. Great singer. I purchase the song, because it was great. I would recommend it to my friends."
Two Stars <SEP> The voice is jarring
Two Stars <SEP> The voice is jarring.
"Five Stars <SEP> I heard this song on a youtube video, and had to have it!!!"
"Hardly competitive <SEP> These recordings by Conlon fail to convince me that he ever heard any of this music before deciding to go public with his impressions.
With both Bruch and Schreker he runs into competition with more effective, congenial and better played recordings.
Bruch's symphonies received a superb account from Masur and the Gewandhausorchester.
The Schreker is one work taken from a previously released album of selected overtures and symphonic composition by Schreker whose quality is completely blotted out by Vinaisky on Chandos.
I suggest to the reader to consult my reviews of these recordings for a fuller picture.
Meanwhile this album does not fill the bill. In terms of conducting it is undercharacterised and not up to the highest standards in terms orchestral playing."
One Star <SEP> Did not like it
"""14 Cheating Love & Honky Tonk Hits From The Heart"" <SEP> ""Pappy"" Daily and his partner Jack Starnes established Beaumont, TX. based STARDAY Records in 1952. Prior to this, Pappy distributed Bally jukeboxes until WWII shut down production, then he opened a record shop; Jack was a nightclub operator and talent agent. STARDAY, a combination of their last names, grew out of Pappy's wholesale record distributorship. Their earliest waxings were made in Jack's home studio. George Jones was the first of many consistent hit-makers to join the label.

After Don Pierce invested in the company in '53, STARDAY relocated to L.A. Around that time, Jack sold his shares to his partners. In '57 there was another move to Madison, TN. A year later Pierce bought out Pappy entirely. STARDAY's founder left to produce records for MERCURY. Over the years, STARDAY absorbed other labels (HOLLYWOOD, KING) but by the mid-'70s and with another change of ownership, STARDAY faded away. Their catalog has subsequently been repackaged under the last owners' own GUSTO imprimatur.

Two Stars <SEP> Nice song
Two Stars <SEP> also starts getting eh...
Two Stars <SEP> It's a lot longer than the other versions.
"Please, no more. <SEP> This song was good for the first 3 times I listened to it. Then, it became so repetitive and boring, so I ended up deleting it. Good for a little bit of time."
dance song <SEP> like this song a lot that i had to purchase it. it is one of those songs that you can listen to and just want to get up and dance.
Wonderful Music <SEP> Loved the music! I have been thinking of purchasing this for a few weeks and finally decided to do it. Best buy! I should have purchased this right away instead of waiting.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song! I enjoy listening to it!
Five Stars <SEP> So happy to have recently discovered CYMANDE
"Five Stars <SEP> Its a very funny song only to be sadly true, enjoyed it a lot."
"great rendition <SEP> very pretty rendition. Lizzy is quite talented. The strings are haunting and her voice is angelic. The only thing that disappointed me was the on-line translation having a huge mistake. Voeux does not mean vow, it means wish."
"Partial song dilemma <SEP> I love this song but only got to hear the first 3 minutes. After the download, I received only part of the song instead of the full 5 minutes."
Four Stars <SEP> good
I wish the recording was tuned to a key that ... <SEP> I wish the recording was tuned to a key that is commonly used. I think this song sorta fits F sharp..
Five Stars <SEP> Love this jam!
"Excellent performances on flawed disc <SEP> The music and performances on this disc are wonderful. Ghedini is a much underrated compoer, and fortunately Cantelli left us several recordings (all broadcast) of the composer. The Casella is a also a good piece, which fortunately Ormandy and Muti both recorded. The Dallapiccola was interesting but couldn't be heard in its entirety. As with many AS discs, this one is flawed with a thumping noise throughout much of the Dallapiccola. (I have noticed such deterioration on many other AS discs from pressing flaws.) The works are all available on other Cantelli discs, including on Testament, I believe. Beware of the AS pressing!"
"Goofy but historically significant one-off <SEP> What is the point of this song?  Why on earth would Paul McCartney desecrate his most-famed song by singing about scrambled eggs?

It is because that was how he originally wrote it.  Paul has often remarked about how he will get a good tune in his head and fill in the words with jibberish just to keep the tune going until he can commit it to tape or memory.  As the story goes, McCartney had dreamt the music to ""Yesterday"" and woke up coming up with the first thing he could to keep the tune going:  ""Scrambled Eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs.""  The song existed as such for weeks until he was sure he didn't plagiarize the music from someone else.  At that point, the proper lyrics were written and history was made.

Almost fifty years later, the idea was revisited with Paul's appearance on Jimmy Fallon's show and additional lyrics were written under the original vein.  Paul even managed to work in a somewhat awkward vegitarian plug with the almost sung verse on chicken wings.

It's fun, strange, and unique.  It isn't too rediculous and they make sure to keep the spontaneous sound of the rewrite during the performance without trying too hard.

I left a star off because for as much of a McCartney fan that I am, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would for whatever reason."
"Four Stars <SEP> I like Maroon 5, good song"
"Inferior to some other Williams <SEP> First, there is some confusion about what this is.  The album lists ""Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out"" at 22 minutes, and ""Midnight Medley"" at 3 minutes.  But this 22-minute track has both the song ""Nobody Loves You..."" and the Midnight Medley.

There has to be some Joe Williams that is better than this.  Some people just don't record well live.  Or maybe it was a bad part of his career.  I love
""Nobody Loves You..."" (or, as it is more familiar to me, ""Nobody Knows You...""), but this performance shows neither Williams nor the song in the most flattering light.  Then we move into ""Lush Life,"" and it's better.  But the next song, which I guess is ""Everything Must Change,"" is horrible.  By now I was so worn out by the see-sawing quality that I wasn't focused enough to make reliable judgments about the remaining songs, but certainly nothing wowed me.  Williams has a unique voice and I have heard him be fantastic.  This just isn't it."
Five Stars <SEP> Good times =)
"A little too pitchy... <SEP> My daughter and I enjoyed this movie and was excited to purchase this song. Tamara clearly has amazing talent, but at times, to be honest I kinda cringed."
One Star <SEP> Was DEFINATELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE!
Have gotten better stuff for free <SEP> Meh. Have gotten better stuff for free.
"Let me down <SEP> I just saw Johnny with Cracker. He's a very good, live, performer.  I guess I was expecting more from such a good guitar player."
"Incredibly diverse and introspective <SEP> This is the 2nd solo record by Johnny Hickman, best known as the lead guitar player from the great 90's rock band Cracker. This is the follow-up to ""Palmhenge"" from 2005, and the bar was set mighty high with that great record. I'm so pleased to say ""Tilting"" is as good or better. Certainly it's more stylistically diverse, and there are no weak tracks. ""Measure Of the Man"" leads off with an appealing Irish feel and a strong lyric. My favorite tracks are ""Destiny Misspent"", a thoughtful mediation on time and lessons learned, ""Sick Cynthia Thing"", a vintage rocker with extremely amusing lyrics, and ""Whittled Down"" the saga of a lost musician. I could rave on and on but if you are a fan of great songs written honestly from the heart this is for you. Get it now! Thanks Johnny."
"not puite what i  heard <SEP> I was excpcting  more acoustic blues than  what was on the cd,I had based this on the song  that I had heard"
"excellent songs & production <SEP> I really, really, really like this album! Excellent songs, excellent album production. The songs are very singable and meaningful.

Notes:
One aim of this album was to introduce some new songs that churches in Scotland might find useful in their own unique worship services. Scottish traditional music and folk melodies have an adaptable quality that renders the best of them timeless. Paraphrases from the Scottish Psalter like Psalm 23 have been sung across the world for centuries, and it's important to remind new generations that these ancient words of scripture remain profoundly relevant. Scottish writers like Horatius Bonar and James Montgomery showed that a wealth of transforming biblical truths could be taught and absorbed through songs, so we also wanted to introduce examples of their lyrics to new listeners.

The motivation for making this hymns recording did not spring simply from a desire to create art. Hymnwriting is about making music firstly out of gratitude to Jesus Christ. With all our imperfections and limitations, Christians struggle to express anything more than an echo of His greatness, but we believe that this is a thing eminently worth sharing. For the person who finds this idea strange, it will hopefully make more sense as you listen! Our hope is that every listener might hear the joy that comes from the gospel: the good news of God's saving and transforming love, made available to every person through his son, Jesus.

ABOUT NEW SCOTTISH ARTS
New Scottish Arts is an arts outreach & education ministry. Our purpose is to serve the Christian community in Scotland by enabling Christians to share their faith through the creative arts, by facilitating vibrant outreach events and projects that will impact on local communities and the whole of Scotland."
WOW <SEP> Great release.  Fantastic recording. Kim Massie's vocals are so impressive but then again the band is awesome.  Great choise of songs to cover and a nice veriety of tempos.
"hot stuff <SEP> This girl can really write.  Fresh, new, and original.  I have bought all of her CDs and love her.  She also is very good looking.  If you are looking to improve your collection of music buy this."
Love JAZZ <SEP> With my older age have been trying new music.  Love JAZZ now
XXL soundtrack is much better. <SEP> Disappointing.  XXL soundtrack is much better.
One Star <SEP> This sounds the same as several of the others that I purchased.
"Glorious is, well...glorious! <SEP> Congratulations, Ben, you did a great job! We plan to use this album to share the love to a whole new city. Glorious is coming to Cataula, Georgia!"
How long does it take? <SEP> Haven't had any result for wife or me - they say I need more words so these are fillers now.
"but many of these recordings are terrible versions of the song <SEP> I'm a huge TW fan, but many of these recordings are terrible versions of the song.  These guys played live amazingly well -- absolutely phenomenal - no joke!!!  I don't know why they didn't just record one of their live performances of these songs and call it a day -- boom done!  These studio versions are really bad though.  I would have killed for a good recording of ""believe me"" or ""surrounded: -- waited years, and years!. But the versions for sale here don't even sound like the same song.  Sorry if this sounds harsh Anna-Lynne and Matt, but what the heck happened?!"
"A rip off! <SEP> I was foolish to spend my money on this.  They don't even provide the script of the ""subliminal messages"" or say how to get them.  I doubt they even exist on this program and if they do they aren't sharing.  Don't waste your money!"
"I really liked this song <SEP> I really liked this song, and Bette Midler had song many great songs over the years, and I felt this was one of them."
"Love Vaughn's version of ""Wave"" <SEP> I heard Sarah Vaughn sing ""Wave"" in the movie, ""Next Stop Wonderland,"" however, it was not on the movie soundtrack.  I had to search high and low for it, but found it on vinyl.  I'm having it converted to CD."
Feelin single <SEP> I brought this song a long time ago and it never played I never had this problem on my droid
"Catchy tune <SEP> This is a different voice than the one who is usually used for Shah Rukh Khan (namely, Udit Narayan), but I still liked this voice (Lalit Pandit), and in fact, I liked this and another song from the movie MORE than I liked the movie! The movie I would give about 3 stars only because SRK is in it!"
R Kelly does it again. <SEP> When a Man lies is a great song about a real topic. Good beat -great lyrics-grear tempo. If you are a Kelly fan add this to your collection
"Solid hardcore bluegrass <SEP> Good bluegrass music has something extra that touches you like no other music does. It puts a tear in your eye and a smile in your soul. It reminds you of the depth of time, the legacy you have received, and the legacy youll pass on. I don't know what that something extra is, but I know these boys have got it."
"Wonderful <SEP> The Inspiration did a wonderful job. The song is great and means alot. If you like good Southern Gospel Music, you will love this song."
"it was probably my fault <SEP> but I thought I was buying Can's Tagomago. I was so excited to see it was available, I bought it on impulse, without further investigation. It is NOT Can. It's a s***ty pop band. VERY disappointed, but take full responsibility."
Five Stars <SEP> beautiful song!
One 20 minute song  $ 8.99 <SEP> What a ripoff... charges same price as a full CD for one 20 minute.... I think NOT... sample sounds medicore on top of that.
Nu metal from Japan <SEP> A uniquely Japanese take on nu metal from Japan. Sounds like an alternate reality universe where Jonathan Davis was a Japanese woman.
"Walter Murphy is today's unknown composer/arranger genius. I sure ... <SEP> Walter Murphy is today's unknown composer/arranger genius.  I sure wish he would
make a big band or orchestral jazz album with no vocals."
Four Stars <SEP> fun
Loved by children and adults <SEP> My 2 and 4 year olds love the  Ballads from the Age of Science CDs.  We especially like Energy & Motion and the Space ones.  The songs are simple and short.  They are easy enough for toddlers to learn but they teach adults too.  It's great having catchy answers to basic science questions for kids.
"Received Black Vinyl, Was Not Pink <SEP> Vinyl was not the pink edition as promised :("
"Wrong color. <SEP> I paid for a colored vinyl, but it came black instead."
Five Stars <SEP> This song is amazing 
"i love her, n love her singing voice <SEP> i love her, n love her singing voice!
one day i couldn't get this song outta my head. looked it up ta see if it was a single....TaDa!
2 days on a constant loop <3
might have to buy the remixes sum day (tho i love the 80 The Bangels sound of this one)"
Piano Music <SEP> I Love
Two Stars <SEP> Stupid song
"Awesome! <SEP> Great song, love the guitar work in it.  Probably my 2nd fav song at the moment, behind Te LACS: Kickin up mud.  Of course, the video rocks as well,"
"I totally geeked out! <SEP> I love the music from Mega Man II and it's exhilarating to hear a good band play the music from this game. It brings me back to my child hood. The guitars and bass play every piece note by note from the game and the drummer has an excellent interpretation of it. The tones of the instruments are fitting to the music and sound great. If you are unfamiliar with the soundtrack of Mega Man II, the music is in a sense a bit repetitive, but the motifs are amazing and totally catchy which makes up for it. I believe that this soundtrack defies the test of time. Mega Man II was released in 1988 and the soundtrack is still one of the most creative, catchy, and inspiring (provided you are a musician or if you are working out) pieces of work and the Bit Brigade revised and polished it from an 8-bit composition to a real live rock/metal sound. I love how they also incorporated a little Mega Man III in there. I believe one track is also from Mega Man IV. To me this is one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever. I'm jealous that the Bit Brigade got to play this music live before I did. lol"
"love it! sing along youtubers! <SEP> great! i really like the voldemort piece, really good. everytime i hear it i sing along, and when i hear the songs that the tunes were stolen from, i sing these lyrics.
Have a nice life!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
Had to buy it <SEP> Heard this song featured recently on a television show and had to have it.  What a great voice and feeling.
AUDIBLE PROOF THAT DRUGS DETROY BRAIN CELLS!!! <SEP> Grab some earplugs and pound down some serious drugs so you can get through this esnsestuous garbage.  I've heard more musical talent from a kindergarden choir!!  Holly crap this is bad.  I cant beleave this guys actualy survived this long!!  After lestinign to this poop i can confirm these guys all sniffed liquid paper in school and graduted to cocain and heroin then stunted their mental capacity to age of 10!!!!!
too bad they split <SEP> my friend bobby wagner is the singer in this band....or was...too bad they split!
"Keep an eye on this band :) <SEP> Exposed is a great release by LOR - having performed these songs on stage with the band - they are fun and high energy industrial rock songs :)

If you have the chance to see us live DO IT ;)

The audio links here don't work but you can hear them on [...] or hear songs from the upcoming release ""Building The Perfect Machine"" on the MySpace [...]

I'm a little biased as a member of the band but if you like fun industrial rock you will love Lights Over Roswell!

Peace,

"If an ego is all you need... <SEP> If an ego is all you need then the road to rock star success is right around the corner.  I recently attended a L.O.R. show in my hometown of Galveston, Tx.  Upon leaving the venue, after the second song, I couldn't have been more embarrased to have to admit I was even near or within three hours driving distance of Lights Over Roswell.  Give me a break, here you have a band signed to a label and all they can do is vomit out five tracks of mundane ""musacal"" garbage within three years.  If you're thinking of buying this album do yourself a favor, save your money and instead I'll come kick you in the face for thirty minutes for half price.  And that would still be better then hearing one note farted out of their speakers."
"I love Paint! <SEP> I found the video on YouTube and couldn't stop hitting the replay button. The song is hilarious, well written, the vocals are ah-mazing (and it doesn't hurt that he's cute too:)"
"Rest In The Wonder <SEP> This is an amazing set of songs that clearly showcase Steve's range and heart for worship! I agree that Your Grace Is Enough could have been exchanged for another less recorded song like Song of Moses or even another of Steve's own works.  However, overall this is a great CD that every age will enjoy!!"
"Love it! What a Blessing <SEP> Fabulous heart felt and Spirit lead music.  God speaks through Steve, again!  Fewer songs then usual but more affordable too."
"Everybody wins is Right! <SEP> Chicago band puts on a good show with this CD.  Lots of energy, great instrumentals, well crafted songs (NOT the same lyrics repeated over, and over)and professionally produced. Class act! Hard to classify it but they refer to themselves as ""Americana"" so I'll go with that. A wide age span would enjoy this group."
"Five Stars <SEP> As described, no problems, thanks!"
"GOOD SONG <SEP> This song is so amazing!!! OMG, Canon made working for God look like so much fun in the video for this song.  Of course, it can be fun if you want it to be!! I know I have fun:)

God Bless"
Another review! <SEP> I never really understood why Amazon requires people to write something when they review.  I think 5 stars are pretty self explanatory.
"Rousing concert march by Mr. Silvestri <SEP> I bought this song because it wasn't included on the original Captain America soundtrack, which was a HUGE disappointment in my eyes.  This is one of the best movie theme's that Alan Silvestri has ever written, and I believe it even rivals John William's Superman March (in my opinion, of course)."
"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! <SEP> I bought the Captain America soundtrack expecting the end credit sequence from the movie to be on it and, to my disappointment, it wasn't. To me the end credit sequence is the best musical piece of the film. I felt robbed, though I do like the music from the rest of the film. I just stumbled upon this and it is the exact piece of music I wanted."
"Do not waste your money <SEP> There are better compilations in the Disney catalogue . Research those before you buy . Plus, everything on this platform including this album is available for only a monthly fee on Spotify . Thus purchase was a waste of my money ."
"These guys are great! They did sound track contributions for Season 3 ... <SEP> These guys are great!  They did sound track contributions for Season 3 Sons of Anarchy.  They have a great, loyal following (the ""Ollie Kids).  Their music is addictive and Toil does not disappoint!"
"Catchy! <SEP> I had never heard of this artist before buying the song. What led me to buy the song was the catchy beat, her beautiful voice, and continuous rotation of play on the radio. I fell in love with the song. The message of the song is also meaningful."
Five Stars <SEP> A Great Artist.
"So encouraging <SEP> If you finally say to yourself, enough is enough and you are going to do what God say to do, then this song is all the encouragement you can use. Plus, I like how he sings it."
"Great Album <SEP> I saw them here in LA a few months ago, and i'm happy to say that they totally sound like in this album.
This is not a remix album album, this is how they would sound if you were in front of them (the only difference is, that even if they're playing live, you don't hear people screaming or clapping, which is awesome)"
Five Stars <SEP> This is a great Guitar song. It's definitely worth the purchase.
"Informative <SEP> Much more intresting than the title suggests. The Holy Spirit gives Joseph Prince so much insight! I hear myself saying ""Wow"" often during his teachings."
No more youtube <SEP> I use to listen to this song on you tube all the time not anymore I downloaded it to me Amazon cloud player so my talking phone and laptop all have it
"Doom metal Juggernaut shows awkward, softer side <SEP> My interest was more than piqued when I heard that Mike Scheidt, the frontman, guitarist and vocalist of the Doom/Sludge/Stoner Juggernaut 'Yob', had put out a solo acoustic album.

Those of you who have seen Yob live know that the men behind the music are just as eclectic and profound as the colossal highs and gut-wrenching lows that Yob evokes in it's listeners.  So, to you, prospective listener, I ask you this:

Before you hit play, you need to take a deep breath, and treat this as something exclusive from all other works.  It is not, in any way similar to not only those styles, but the emotions evoked.  It is an entirely different animal-- no, it's an entirely different species; life form, maybe.  This, to some, should come as no surprise.

What we have here is something that's not necessarily 'powerful' in the sense that a listener would be used to-- you have to hunt for it, a bit.  If you're an audiophile like I consider myself, this should come as no surprise.  Good music grows on you-- sometimes like a sickness, sometimes like a deep, profound joy.  This album kind of did both.

There is definitely something altogether eclectic and strange about Scheidt's lyrical presence in this record-- his first two tracks have sparse instrumentals, and mainly focus on him setting the stage for this emotional journey.  He constructs, presents, and confronts-- although a bit abstractly- a lineup of his own demons, and kills them systematically with kindness, joy, love, and pure emotional vulnerability.  It's alien flower-power, but it also displays exactly where one would imagine Scheidt's soul to reside-- and this is what I think separates Scheidt's vision from a good lot of other artists and musicians: Scheidt's biggest weapon (and in Yob, too) is his ability to turn anything into lead.  His airy, shy vocals in this album give way sometimes and the sheer profundity of the narrative is a bit staggering at times.  Some won't like this style from Scheidt, some will be indifferent, and others will accept it with, just as he presents it, open arms.

I find myself having a difficult time quantifying this album-- I don't think it should be critiqued the way that other albums so helplessly rise and fall.  It's designed to be intimate-- to be personal, so while I have an idea of how I would, hypothetically, quantify it, I'm going to leave it at a 4 star rating, not because it's good or great or, but because it asks to be heard in such a way that I think anything less wouldn't be doing Scheidt any justice."
"great lyrics <SEP> The music is slightly above average, but not great. The lyrics though are fantastic. Gets at the heart of the gospel nicely."
great music <SEP> I love classical music it helps me to relax and gives me a chance to share different music with my grandchildren
"From Beach Boys to Punk Rock <SEP> The Sunny Boys started out as a Beach Boys' tribute band but soon evolved into a more Beach Boys' influenced band, writing their own material and releasing the extraordinary ""Beach Sounds"" in 2008. From there, at least in North America, they kinda fell off the radar until 2012 when they resurfaced not as a six piece band with excellent vocal harmonies, but as a four piece punk rock type outfit. According to their website, this new sound was due to a ""search for better music quality"" - I call it selling out. While this new album may contain subtle traces of surf music influence, Beach Boys music it is not and therefore, is not that appealing to this Beach Boys fan."
Five Stars <SEP> ok
5 stars <SEP> Great action music 3 min 22 sec
"Not 100% ""original"" but certainly a ""keeper""!!! <SEP> Buy it - love it - KEEP IT!!!

The song ""Keep It"" has an unmistakable ""Kansas - Carry On My Wayward Son"" vibe to it. The melodies and lyrics are unique so it is certainly more of a ""tribute song"" than a ""cover"". The instrumental performances grow increasingly hyperactive and super-charged as the song ""progresses"" along. To its credit, however, it never strays too far from its point of inspiration. Even as the prog-rock quotient surpasses typical Kansas territory, the syncopations, arrangements and even stylistic bits all point back to classic Kansas.

This is a very high quality production that cleverly flirts with - yet never quite crosses - the line separating ""cover song"" from ""original"". If you like catchy melodic hard rock with excellent vocals, top notch prog-rock virtuosity on ""real"" instruments like drums, guitar, bass and keyboards, this is a fantastic song. Quite simply... IT ROCKS

Hot off the heels of successful single releases of Kansas and Beatles cover tunes, it should perhaps come as no surprise that neo-classic prog rockers Magellan's first track from their newest album would carefully bridge the gap that separates ""cover"" from ""original"".  Hopefully some of Magellan's new ""cover"" fans will make the transition over to buying and enjoying ""Inert Momentum"" a collecton which promises to be the first album of new compositions from the band in half a decade.

"From MainlyPiano <SEP> ""Wedding Classics"" is a selection of seventeen classical pieces (sixteen in the download version) arranged and performed for solo piano by Randi Rokke. This is Rokke's third CD to date, following ""Joy,"" a Christmas collection, and ""Tell the Story,"" a collection of hymns, both released in 2009. A longtime music educator, church musician, and the wife and daughter of Lutheran pastors, Ms Rokke brings a lifetime of musical experience to her recordings. She has played the piano for many, many weddings over the years, and this collection is made up of favorites that she has used as preludes, postludes, processionals, and recessionals. Several of the pieces are very standard wedding faire - Wagner's ""Bridal Chorus"" (often referred to as ""Here Comes the Bride""), Mendelssohn's ""Wedding March,"" and the venerable Pachelbel's ""Canon in D,"" but there is also an assortment of other wedding-appropriate classical music that isn't nearly as commonly heard. Along with being a very warm and pleasant CD to listen to, ""Wedding Classics""  provides brides and wedding planners a one-stop sampler of music to choose from for that special day. The liner notes of the CD also give a brief but informative history of each piece and its composer. The CD contains a bonus track, ""Prelude In a Classic Style"" by Gordon Young, a contemporary composer who passed away in 1998. Several of these pieces were originally composed for organ or for orchestra, and Ms Rokke has arranged those for piano solo. The composers represented are Henry Purcell, George F. Handel (2), JS Bach (5), Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy (2), Gordon Young, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Pachelbel, Cesar Franck, Jeremiah Clarke, and Edvard Grieg. My own favorites include Handel's ""Thanks Be To Thee,"" Bach's ""Cello Suite #1,"" Debussy's ""Reverie,"" Young's ""Prelude In Classic Style,"" Bach's ""Arioso,"" Franck's ""Panis Angelicus,"" and Grieg's ""Wedding Day At Troldhaugen.""

This album makes for very pleasant listening and is a handy tool for selecting music for a wedding."
so talented... <SEP> If you're looking for some fresh bluegrass/folk from an immensely talented lyricist/musician/singer you've come to the right place. Get it!
"Bridge Across Our Fears by Soul Aviv <SEP> I met this group after a concert they performed in my town.  I love
 the music and the meanings.  The song is beautiful and inspiring leading me to a deeper faith.  I have a lot of this group's music on my Kindle Fire and love all of their songs.  This is an amazing group and so very down to earth."
One Star <SEP> Scratched to hell.
The best from Scotland <SEP> So many wonderful memories from childhood
"WOW!!!  Great reality check... <SEP> Heard it on 98.5 ktis.fm ... grateful...new to me but God put it on my heart and mind today!!! (""i've heard the story"")...how often have we been told ""about"" God/Jesus/Holy Spirit, but until it was personal like this, it was just frustrating.  So grateful that ""God is faithful"" because HE LOVES US all!!!"
"WOO HOO <SEP> I REALLY LIKE,LOVE,ADORE, THIS SONG AND THE BOYS(MEN)MY DAUGHTER IS AUTISTIC AND SHE HAS COME OUT OF HER SHELL WHILE LISTENING TO THESE GUYS."
"Can You Spell BLUR??? <SEP> What a rip off!! non inspiring, not original, a desperate attempt to create a summer song by stealing a classic hook from a 90s Indie hit by British band Blur (song 2) . My daughter is 11 and she knows better, then to call these guys anything by creative, I've played songs in the car that show how diverse a real band can be. Now it seems music has been more recycled then before, making money from kids that don't care or don't know any better."
... Ray Charles and he sings about the USA -- Fantastic! <SEP> It's Ray Charles and he sings about the USA -- Fantastic!
Terrific.. <SEP> Lovely piece by Dr. Roche...
"Marvelous playing and writing, but fidelity was under standard ... <SEP> Marvelous playing and writing, but fidelity was under standard.  I downloaded the MP files, and would suspect the CD to be an improvement."
"The only version worth owning! <SEP> Yes! Finally the original and best version, from the 12"" 45rpm EP on the White Noise label, sheesh.. what took so long for this classic cut to become available? After having to put up with those other lame a$$ed takes, this is thee one, the one I played over and over until I wore out the grooves.. Thank you!"
"I am sorry to say this CD was a waste of my (high-priced) payment (and was not available to ... <SEP> This band was suggested to me by Amazon because of a band member who was previously with the legendary Radiators Band from New Orleans. I am sorry to say this CD was a waste of my (high-priced) payment (and was not available to review at the time of purchase nor available in mps.)  If you are a Radiators fan, or a fan of New Orleans-style jazz-rock, you will be greatly disappointed by this one.  but this is just my opinion."
Some of NOLA's Best!! <SEP> Well worth the time and $$ to own. A band well worth supporting. Willie's at his best and really has the band's ideas gel together. All the players are great and can really solo on their respected instruments!!
Very neat music <SEP> That great guitar sound with that signature reverb from the early days of rock n roll turns out great riffs on Citizens of the world which has got a kicking groove too! I love that sound even more as it blazes Hot Rod Caravan and America and adds a different twist to Gypsy Rock n Roll. Adding to the variety is a nice east-west fusion kind of touch on Ichinen! Brilliant stuff!
"Not what I meant to purchase. <SEP> I meant to purchase the regular version of this song, but from my phone, I couldn't tell that this was the lullaby version until I purchased it. I have no use for a lullaby version of Train...waste of a dollar."
Intense and moving <SEP> Such an amazing voice and a great arrangement.  A classic vibe from a wonderful new angle!  It's nice to see that the industry takes a break from politics and correctness to allow such a talent to flourish.
"Not salsa <SEP> I bought this album because I'm taking a salsa class and I wanted some practice music. I wasn't really concerned with it being the best artists or most famous songs. I just wanted music with the right pace and rhythm for practicing salsa. The first song--which I previewed before purchasing--actually is salsa, but most of the rest are not. There is probably more merengue on this album than actual salsa. It's reasonable to call this a Latin album, but very few of the songs are truly salsa (with the distinctive clave rhythm), and not many are even at the right tempo for dancing salsa.

In short, don't waste your money!"
This would be better if the person talking would stop talking about half ... <SEP> This would be better if the person talking would stop talking about half way through the session. He gets you very relaxed and in a good state then stops talking for a while then suddenly starts speaking again. Its jarring and makes it so you need to get back into the relaxed state all over again.  He should either continue to talk or stop at a point instead of talking pausing for a few minutes then talking again.
"Winter Dance Party artist <SEP> One of the Sardo brothers played alongside Buddy Holly during the Ill fated tour of 1958-59.  This CD contains their early Rock songs (some good and a few that are very weak), but none of the later movie soundtracks are included.  Neither brother really had what it took to become major stars, but this is a nice collection."
"Not what I expected. <SEP> I was highly impressed with her 1st CD, but this comes across like a blend of new era and disco. To be fair, I'm 60 yrs old, and this is apparently directed at a younger crowd. I suppose that should she continue to create music which appeals to geezers such as myself, she will most likely wind up eating out of a garbage can.

Allow me to wish her the best, as she is a tremendous talent. And perhaps I should encourage everyone to purchase this CD, just to keep her in beer and beans until she knocks another one over the center field wall. Can't win 'em all.

But to be completely fair, this CD is just as forgettable as her 1st was magical.

Sincerely,
Who Asked Me?"
"I was waiting and waiting... <SEP> For years after her first album, I've been checking up on Kelly Sweet to come out with a new one. She was that original back then and now, wow. She just blows it out of the water! She sets the standard high - musically and vocally. Her lyrics have changed, you can tell they reflect what has gone on in her personal life (I read about the death of her parents within 6 months). It's beautiful and passionate and meets every musical need I have - Thank you Kelly Sweet!!"
"Not a real vinyl album, cheap copy, doesn't even work <SEP> I would NEVER order this or any other item from ""Hard to find Records."" This is no more than a cheap one sided vinyl record that has been copied, not labeled with the name of the group or songs. Nothing even mentions the groups name except a cheap sticker on the vinyl cover. as you can see in pictures (1), there is not the whole album on here, would take more room (2) nothing on one side and (3) only mention of the music group is the little sticker on the album cover. The album is warped a little and also the grooves are not deep enough for the needle to grip, just slides across the album."
"Chill & Inviting <SEP> This album is high quality! She is the real deal; a true musician who writes her own music, sings live and plays instruments.

 The album flows perfectly and all the songs are memorable; from the uplifting opener, 'Foxes', fit for any summer day to the dreamlike ending with 'Extraterrestrial',  'Rain Falls' and 'Cheap Wine'- Molly takes you on a wild, yet relaxing ride. My favorite track is 'Face It' with it's inspirational lyrics and buoyant groove, but really every track is great and the album can and should be played all the way through."
"Four Stars <SEP> HEY SOUL PIONEERS, I'M DIGGIN IT!"
Nice <SEP> Different but I like it. It kind of reminds me of me and my hubby courting. Just the thought of being alone and all the potential of Us. He was Superman to me...still is. Needless to say this song does it for me.
"Not even worth it for free <SEP> I purchased this CD because it sounded OK. on the movie...but once I received it and hear most of it really SUCKED!! big time, don't waste your money & time waiting for it..you'll miss NADA (nothing)"
"Fantastic Soundtrack of a Great Movie <SEP> I saw the movie ""Savages"" several times in the theater & I recently pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon.com of course. I totally enjoyed the movie & I just loved the CD soundtrack. You will really enjoy listening to the music & reliving the scenes from the movie.  The music has quite a beat to it & you are guaranteed
to get off your chair & start dancing to it. It's also great listening while you are driving in your car with the wind blowing in your hair. ""Savages"" was a great book, an even greater movie & the soundtrack from the movie is absolutely fantastic. Buy it & I guarantee you will love it as much as I do. Definitely a 5 star item."
"This song was so scratched that I deleted it after one listen. <SEP> Wonderful song, but don't download this copy of it.  You'll be disappointed if you do.  Don't waste your time or money."
crunkjuice <SEP> I bought it because I thought it was slower
"Who's fooling who? <SEP> Oh come, this is not Frijid Pink, it's a rip-off."
"Very good song, and not what I expected. I love this song it sets a freaky mood. <SEP> Very good song, and not what I expected. This song got everybody on the floor. Fantastic."
Make me laugh <SEP> Hilarious
Brings you back in time <SEP> I bought this for my mom's 80th birthday party.  The quality of the sound is phonograph quality but it's the original recording so I expected nothing less.
"Peace is for everyone <SEP> This one sort of brought me to tears but I guess that may be what I needed. I felt ""cleansed"" and restored afterwards. It may be different for you. In fact, they all probably will be as we atr individuals. However, I sincerely doubt that very many will walk away from this without feeling so much better."
Beautiful song <SEP> A beautiful song by a great group of singers.  The song is beautiful and the Village Singers have beautiful voices.
"not the real tracks <SEP> Only listened to the first one, but that's not the original recording. Sounds like some cheap cover. I don't even understand how this is legit."
Much better than the Broadway company <SEP> Great CD. The cast is amazing and the songs are sung so beautifully.  Philip Quast fans must get this CD.
"just not good... <SEP> This is a very poor recording of Carousel. Across the board, the leads are mediocre vocalists who way over-act the dialogue interspersed in the music. The ensemble has a nice sound, but definitely skip this and order the Broadway cast recording."
"Pretty horrible <SEP> In my opinion, the singing is really pretty lousy, and the orchestra's sound is mixed very badly. Or maybe it's just a particuarly bad orchestration. The Carousel Waltz is quite horrible, with various instruments sounding far too prominently in what should be an overall blended sound.

I am sorry I bought this recording - however it did enable me to appreciate how FAR superior (in every way) the 1994 Broadway production recording is."
"Don't buy.. <SEP> Nice version,  beautiful vocals, but  abruptly ends. Seems like recording was not completely transfered, don't waste your money on this."
Love it <SEP> This is my favorite Roy Orbison song so it's great having it on my MP3 player. Now I can listen to it whenever I want
"Not even close <SEP> Not the original artist, song and voice didn't even sound close, weird and it's so bad I can't listen to it"
"Music to Move You <SEP> I am always seeking out new music... whether it is older music that I never noticed or brand new music.  This song came up as a recommended.. if you like.... then consider... option on some website...maybe Amazon but I'm not sure.

The track has a good beat and is part of my workout playlist."
"One Star <SEP> Great album, but the record arrived warped so badly that it's unplayable."
"Buy it and let it blow your mind <SEP> Debo incorporates many different styles of Ethiopian musics in this album. It's not just great music, it's an education in Ethiopian culture. What a simply wonderful release. Don't miss out on this."
One Star <SEP> Nice
Five Stars <SEP> Very good mix
Jazz + Star Trek = Cool! <SEP> I'm a 40+ year Trekkie and this is one of the best Trek related items I've ever purchased. Well done. Very well done.
Five Stars <SEP> very good
NOT GREAT <SEP> The song that proped me to buy this CD is not included in the format of this CD which is just uninspired songs by the group.
"good praise music <SEP> these songs are catchy, uplifting and glorifying to God"
Five Stars <SEP> Love this music.
"SONG <SEP> VERY GOOD SONG, WAS MOVED BY THE SONG, WOULD LISTEN TO THIS SONG EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO."
Not challenging enough <SEP> Average motivation for average people
You're cheating! <SEP> Don't get this one
"music I love <SEP> Great cd...this song Something To Remind you is my all time favorite by Aaron Lewis...I am gonna miss the band Staind, but he can go solo, and It would still be a sold out concert."
Two Stars <SEP> Like the music - hate the words
Grew up with this band <SEP> So glad there still making music. This song is another one of there greats. Seen them live at least 50 to 100 times it was the best time of my life. Thanks  G.C.
"What a rip off! Don't put a tribute artist under the original artist! <SEP> I would put no stars if possible. This is NOT what it says it is! This title was under the artist Tangerine Dream, the original artist who did the theatrical score for the movie ""Legend"". When I saw that there was a single of the ""Unicorn Theme"", I bought it. Only after I did, did the actual artist pop up as Brandon K. Varrett. I bought this on the app, and the real ""tribute"" artist was hidden. I hope that this review will save someone their money. Also, all I can find now for the official ""Legend"" soundtrack (for digital) is the Jerry Goldsmith's special edition score, and this tribute soundtrack. You can only find Tangerine Dream's on disc. If you can find it at all."
"This is not the tangerine dream song from the movie <SEP> This is not the same song that is at the end of the movie, at least not the theatrical version. It is pretty, but it is not what I was expecting and I am fairly annoyed."
"Atlantis the best of all Stargate's <SEP> RIP Joel Goldsmith! His work for Stargate though will live on in all our lives. Atlantis is my favorite of the three shows and the theme is one that I never fast forward through. Short, sweet, but to the point."
I am sure the cd is great but my 1year old bought it on accident <SEP> I am sure the cd is great but my 1year old bought it on accident. I emailed and asked for a refund and haven't been replied to or given one.
Entertaining music <SEP> The music is good for entertaining a little one.  I feel that it's more geared towards toddlers than an infant.
"Good rhythm <SEP> This is one of the catchiest and colorful-sounding songs I've heard in a while. If you're tired of the blandness on the radio right now, give this one a try."
"unpleasant <SEP> Technically challenging. Brilliantly played. But, better left as a practice piece than a performance piece unless your purpose is to agitate your audience."
Five Stars <SEP> Lynyrd Skynyrd
Five Stars <SEP> AWESOME!
Four Stars <SEP> Classic
"West Coast - New Orleans fusion grooves <SEP> Wil Blades is a young jazz organist and leads his sextet in a superb collection of his own compositions on this album.  His command of jazz is partly learned from formal studies, but clearly is driven by sounds and phrasings picked up over the years.  Blades is mostly a straight ahead jazz type, falling somewhere between a laidback Bay Area groover and a New Orleans funkster.  For a stronger New Orleans feel and pounding drum beat, try 32nd Street (tk 2) or the title track Sketchy (tk 7).  For a more swinging sound (in the jazz sense) check out the melodious and inspired solos on Why? (tk 1) and the soothing, lengthy organ and guitar solos on Where Go? (tk 4).  For a hard bop with smooth undertones, I recommend Mr. Lewis (tk 8) and for an easy-going funky track, play Mae Mae (tk 10). Good stuff all around."
The original is the best! This version is just fine. <SEP> Having hard time to listen to something that originally has been great and then someone has just programmed it and recorder in almost midi style quality.  Go for the original!  This one is a poor choice.
"8-bit Disaster <SEP> Who the hell released this 8-bit, Super Mario inspired, disaster?  The producer must have been deaf.  Someone needs to be punished for releasing this...  This should never have seen the light of day!"
"SO GOOD. <SEP> great album from Austin, Texas' best pop punk band. great music, great dudes. buy all of their albums. throw all your money at this band."
"The song was great, but I understood there was another song (""You're ... <SEP> The song was great, but I understood there was another song (""You're all invited to the party"") on the cd.  That's the song I am trying to acquire."
"Authentic Cajun Music <SEP> I happen to Love this song especially at this time of the year. Growing up in the Bayou country, I have listened to this song since I was old enough to understand it. For us as kids, we ran (celetbrated) Mardi Gras much like kids do for Holloween except we did it during the day."
Low quality recording <SEP> This is a pretty awesome song... Too bad the file you get from Amazon is extremely low quality -- a 128 kbps MP3. WTF?!
"So-So Songs... <SEP> Usually I like whatever John Oates or Daryl Hall appear on, but I just didn't like this song or ""Let The Rain"" either."
"""You're not a pimp and I'm not your little man"" <SEP> In the top 10 best EP's I've ever heard. Title track is great (even though Robert doesn't sing lead). Definitely worth having"
"BAND OF THE GRENADIER GUARDS <SEP> first heard this grenadier guards effort when i was a sophomore in high school about a hundred years ago.  on vinyl and mono to boot.
in the middle sixties i ran across it on stereo reel to reel tape.  i thought i had died and went to heaven.  now, after downloeading it from amazon, i like it even more.  somewhere along the way, i lost the reel to reel and was pleasantly surprized that amazon had it.
the entire mp3 is light military band music."
"Unacceptable Hash <SEP> I love the tune.  But there's something seriously wrong with this mp3.  I get weird random skips and occasional beep artifacts. It's basically unlistenable.

I've DL'd several songs from Amazon.  I've never had a problem with Winamp playing them. So I suspect the problem lies in the file.

While this is the only tune I've bought from this album, I'd recommend that McKendree Spring fans wait until the problem is straightened out to buy any cut."
Alto Sax <SEP> Sonny plays all alto sax on Blows The Blues as stated by Leonard Feather in the original liner notes and I can confirm it. The Fresh Sound back paper wrongly credits him with both alto and tenor. He plays the opening of a couple of tunes in what must be the lowest key possible in the lower register but the alto sax is unmistakable in the ensuing solo. He gets a good sound out the lower register approximating the sound of the upper register of the tenor. On the Hard Swing he plays alto sax 7 times and tenor sax 4 times.  Pianist Lou Levy gives way to Amos Trice for the second session but Amos doesn't take many solos with Stitt playing the whole track himself most of the time.
Solid Bassist <SEP> Reminds me of Waymond Tisdale
Two Stars <SEP> Okay
Niiiiiiiiiiccccce! <SEP> Very enjoyable music. If you like smooth sounds you'll like Vincent Ingala! He's a rising star with a great career ahead of him.
Five Stars <SEP> This one did not all download.  Maybe half the song.

"Dave Fields is in the new crop of blues guiatrists and he just may have it <SEP> Every few years a new crop of Blues Rock guitarists appear on the scene, oozing out of garages, barrooms and off of street corners where the neighborhood watch committee finally got street light erected. It started in the `60s, really, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and then the Americans, Mike Bloomfield, Ry Cooder, Johnny Winter. The 70s gave us Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Santana, Duane Allman, the 80s Mark Knopfler and so on. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many more have come on the scene since. It's an attractive niche to try and fit into. It has so much room to shine. And it is easy to fail; get lost in the crowd. There's the whole ""cross roads"" myth about having to sell your soul to really be granted that extra something that it takes to be the next Jimi Hendrix, the next Robert Johnson.

Dave Fields is in the new crop and he just may have it. Hi third album,  Detonation, explodes with a harder rocking sound drenched in many a variety of styles touching on classic rock , jazz-blues and reggae mixed in with a blast of blinding blues that pays tribute, most notably to Beck and Hendrix with nods to Buddy Guy (especially in those passages where the notes fly off his ax like shrapnel in the middle of soulful songs).

From the first notes of the opening song, ""Addicted To Your Fire"" (which you'd have to be blind or deaf not to recognize Hendrix ""Stand Next To You Fire"" in) it is apparent that he is setting the bar at Jimi height.

Fields explores 1960s psychedelia on ""Prophet in Disguise,"" a melodic track with an Eastern-influenced guitar lick that is more David Gilmour than George Harrison. Track three is a favorite. ""Doin Hard Time,"" is slow, smoldering blues duet with Grammy Award Winning blues singer and guitarist,  Joe Louis Walker that works very well. Track five is a fun song, ""Bad Hair Day,"" is an interesting mix of reggae and the blues, vowing not to let his hair get him down.

On ""Better Be Good"" you can hear him channeling SRV to good effect. It delivers some social commentary and his guitar is at the best here as he pulls everything out of his bag of tricks. The purest blues tune on the album is probably ""Pocket Full Of Dust"", The guitar attacks and it stings. It's soaked in blues soul ala Buddy Guy and the great Chicago stylists. The organ of Vladimir Barsky works well behind his guitar explosions and drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Andy Huenerberg round out his band quite well.

Detonation is produced by David Z (Prince, Johnny Lang, Etta James, Buddy Guy) and  is a 12-song exploration of Fields'  electrifying guitar prowess. This album has the feel of Fields stepping out of the pure blues spot light and expanding his sound into more rock, but he never, like all the greats before him, completely abandons the blues, instead he has absorbed them and is ready to let the blues be his foundation for what he creates from here on out.

Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Prelude by the Ronstadt family <SEP> I bought this CD because I heard ""Malaguena Salerosa"" one night on the radio, and even though it was in Spanish and I didn't understand a word of it, I loved it!  The harmonies are fabulous!  The rest of the album is good.  Their cover of ""For What It's Worth"" is a keeper, and this is now one of my favorite albums."
Five Stars <SEP> A
Now I get it! <SEP> Great example of my life right now. Enjoyable song about a lovable loser
Beatles' Album review <SEP> The album arrived in a very good package. The two LP's of the album are in good shape but not the album itself. Arrival was good too.
"Alligatoah is a rare talent <SEP> I don't understand German but I was exposed to and impressed by Alligatoah from his work in Trailerpark. I don't need to speak the language to be moved by his rich singing voice, ability to create perfect melodies, and unique flows while rapping. On top of all this is a Zappa-esque effortless sarcasm that makes it apparent this is a man to whom nothing is sacred.

This is a more rap-heavy album and to my ears not as good as his work in Trailerpark, but there are still some fantastic songs, particularly In Gottes Namen, which, in trying to discern meaning from google translate, is a satirical song celebrating terrorism. Indeed, Alligatoah also goes by the name TopTerrorist, and satirizes Islam in ways few artists dare. Sure, he goes after the safe target of Christianity too. Another of the best songs breaks into a chorus of ""Mein gott hat den langsten penis"", which doesn't require google translate."
"Arrival of package in damaged condition <SEP> When my package arrived, the package was crumbled, the plastic holder for the CD was cracked in 2 places and the original ""cover"" that was advertised on Amazon was not the cover I received in the CD.  After spending close to $40.00 dollars - I deserve better."
"Love , love it <SEP> Such an awesome song, a very moving song that gets to the heart, beautifully written by a dear friend of mine"
"all original tracks are far far superior <SEP> Big disappointment. While the remixes of Caroline's debut album ""Murmurs"" all brought unique approaches to the each track, making them actually sound like new versions, these ""remixes"" are just too minimal. Except for maybe the last track, all of the songs from Verdugo Hills are stripped of either the main arrangement and replaced with minimal lazy/ basic arrangements washed in reverb, or the vocals are nearly altogether removed for a bare bones dub version. I absolutely loved Verdugo Hills and thought there was much potential for good alternate versions, but these are really really lazy and uneventful sounding. Nearly all the artists remixing did a disservice to the beautiful and well crafted tracks from Verdugo Hills, stripping them of life and character."
Unhindered is awesome! <SEP> Got this after our church had Unhindered at a youth retreat.  My sons love the son and it is on their mp3 players! :-)
Wierd <SEP> I simply did not get it. I am looking for a different kind of music to enjoy. I'll keep looking
"Not to my taste. <SEP> The only reason I downloaded it was because it was free
Not to my taste. I really didn't like it at all.
The only reason I downloaded it was because it was free"
"very interesting <SEP> Great album, very soothing and interesting and amazing lyrics, especially for Moonbeams. The music videos are great too, if you look the songs up on youtube. I hope they get more recognition for their music soon."
"Awesome <SEP> Awesome, Long live Donzilla"
"In my opinion I think this soundtrack is superior to the original <SEP> In my opinion I think this soundtrack is superior to the original, even though there is only one album and not two albums in this record.  So only about half the songs are on this recording.  Jenny Mason sings ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"" On This Recording and I find her version of the song superior to the original,  Jenny has the perfect voice for this song,  the other songs were very well done as well and I thought the arrangements are great!!!!"
Two Stars <SEP> Not orignal
Five Stars <SEP> Great Album
"Throw back <SEP> Great album, took me back to when grunge was king. The tracks rock out but keep it simple and catchy. I recommend this album to anyone looking to rock"
"best album 2012 <SEP> best album i've heard in a long time. from beginning to end, they move you from summer to winter. sounds so good."
Beautiful <SEP> Love it
Good but I think I prefer the original <SEP> Not quite as good as the original.
"Old Material. <SEP> I bought Matt's first cd and loved it. I was super excited to buy this album next. I anxiously bought it and started listening.  To my shock and anger, a lot of the material was on his first album.  So in knew the bits.  A lot more of the material was on the Nerdist episode 51 (free podcast) where Matt performed stand-up.

So I paid $10 for material I already had. At least half of the bits were old.  I was pretty irritated.  I won't be fooled again.

Thanks"
Soulful falsetto.. very cool wah-wah sound.. Smooth as silk and twice as fun <SEP> If you are a product of the 70's you will remember and relive through this timeless radio classic. Lot's of imitators but not as good as the original.
Unfortunately they just don't have it anymore... ... <SEP> Unfortunately they just don't have it anymore.....buy the studio versions on the songs this one is horriable ...they can no longer harmonize
"AWESOME <SEP> I have bought and downloaded ALL the music from this group of performers.  If you log into bandscamp, you can also download a few additional songs not available on Amazon.  On BYU tv app for Roku, they have a series called,  Music that changed my life (or something similar), they have an episode on this group, which is really awesome.

I have the music on my Computers, phones and mp3 players.  We have given cd's to the missionaries in our area, and they love it.  I love the easy going traditional music of this.  I only wish that they would do more.  For those that did not know it, Ryan Shupe even played a few songs with them."
Five Stars <SEP> Quality as advertised.
Not the song I was looking for. I wanted ... <SEP> Not the song I was looking for. I wanted the one from the 80's that was a kind of rap or hip hop song general hos*pi*tal.
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song!
Great album. You can play free on Spotify <SEP> $511.90 haha! Get real!  I picked this up for $10 at my local record store.  Great album. You can play free on Spotify
"LOVE IT!!!! <SEP> Since this CD (for some dumb reason) can not be bought nor could be found on swedish Spotify, I decided to order it on Amazon... This turned out to be the best desicion I have taken for a while!! I can not stop listening on this amazing album!!!"
War is over <SEP> I did not like the version of war is over. I think they destroyed the lyrics. Will not recommend this version.
"Awesome! <SEP> What could be better than Christmas? Well, Christmas AND Shinedown. This is an awesome Christmas song sung by one of the best bands on the decade!"
"Don't do it! <SEP> Simply a waste of money and time. If this chick's music was even half as interesting as she finds herself, it might be worthy of a second listen.
Sorry..."
"9 seconds??? <SEP> Why was I charged full price for a song on this CD that was only 9 seconds??  I don't know who is responsible...the artist or Amazon.  I would appreciate an explanation from Amazon though.

Thank you."
One Star <SEP> I thought this would be good music.  It's aweful
"If you are a CSN fan, please do yourself ... <SEP> If you are a CSN fan, please do yourself a favor and don't but this album.  It is beyond awful.  To be honest, I could not get beyond the third track.  How could this happen?"
"Very sad. <SEP> They sound old, low, and slow.  Very sad."
"Makes me sad to hear this <SEP> Their voices don't blend... their harmonies barely exist... their timing with each other is off, like each one is singing for himself instead of as a unit... Steven Stills' voice is painful to listen to...  I'm over 60 and remember how amazing they were in their heyday, when Crosby, Stills, Nash and sometimes Young were putting out top quality music and vocals. I think it's time for them to retire as a group."
"We should all be grateful!!! <SEP> If you listen to the song you will buy it!  The words are wonderful --- I converted to a ring tone for my phone and every time it rings, it reminds me to be grateful for all I have!"
Five Stars <SEP> One of the funniest bits I've ever heard!
the farm? <SEP> I don't even know what the heck this is  what is this? what is this? what is this thing? What/
"Great Album! <SEP> Love The Farm!  Have seen them in concert and was inspired to buy their album, very happy I did! Highly recommend others do as well!"
The Farm Inc. <SEP> This music is incredible! I love the lyrics and everything to this! Happy with my purchase. There isn't a single song on there that I don't like!
A life long CSN fan <SEP> Have loved their music for decades.  Saw them at the Greek Theatre last year and was there in 1969 too.
You'll have to buy the Hightlights CD if you want the best version of this song. <SEP> Was looking for the Crosby-Nash Highlights Album studio version.  This isn't it.
"Five Stars <SEP> my favorite album, by far by them"
I love it! Great tunes! <SEP> I love it! Great tunes!
Five Stars <SEP> nice song
"It's not what I wanted <SEP> Had searched and searched and thought this was the version
I used to listen to during the year it was first released.
I am sorry that I am not happy purchasing this.
I don't mean that it is a bad version but it is just not
what I had been searchin for."
"Overnight song <SEP> My husband says this a great song.  He enjoys playing it
for swing dancing and for relaxing and listening in the evening."
"Good song <SEP> Harmonies are great.  Meaningful lyrics.  Smooth.  I wouldn't listen to anything else Zac does, but this particular song is nice."
Great tune <SEP> What can you say - Zach Brown
love good music <SEP> Who doesn't like the Zac Brown Band?  I purchased it for my Kindle Fire and enjoy it at work any chance I get.
Five Stars <SEP> awesome thanks
The music is nice but don't be like me and expect it to ... <SEP> The music is nice but don't be like me and expect it to match what was in the movie. I was trying to find the movie version vs. the cd version of that scene.
"Cornucopia <SEP> In a ""love song"" mode, this is the Album for you, I ""love"" many of the singles, there's also a little Consciences added in. Edge Michael shares his concerns for moral issues. I particularly enjoy Hazel Eyes, You've Got My Love and You & I which vocalizes the many things one can do to make a lover feel special. Interested in knowing what's in works for the New Album."
Big disappoint! <SEP> Right jewel box.  Wrong CD.  Big disappoint!
"You Yabby Yabby You, don't know who he is..... you don't know enough about Roots Reggae. <SEP> This is one of the most powerful Roots Reggae albums I have ever encountered. Vivian Jackson aka. Yabby You lifts up the highly livicated praises to Jah Jah"
Five Stars <SEP> good grace
I was so disappointed <SEP> I saw them at FYF in Los Angeles and they were fantastic. This album is just boring and blah. Boo.
not San Francisco's Poolside <SEP> This is not an album by Los Angeles's Poolside.  This is an even more obscure band out of PA.  Chances are if you like the other you won't like this one.
Five Stars <SEP> good blues tune
Four Stars <SEP> Good chill track.
Avoid.  There are much better versions. <SEP> Terrible version.  Sounds like random instruments playing in parts.  Avoid this version of this wonderful music.
Disappointing <SEP> Not as great as I had hoped. Only a few cuts are really good.
Five Stars <SEP> Good.
Two Stars <SEP> bad
"considering it was a great deal of "" disco "" ( rave ) music ... <SEP> I was not too enthused about disc 2 as much, considering it was a great deal of  "" disco "" ( rave ) music which, of course, is all up tempo all the time. The 1st disc was excellent with nice easy rhythms & haunting melodies."
"Possibly the best in the RELAX series <SEP> There are only 2 Cd's in the Relax series I really enjoy, this one and 8. Both are uptempo and mixed, compared to the previous six discs. I get the chill factor, sit back and relax theme, but this disc makes me want to tap my toes or get up and dance!
A word to the wise, before purchasing the other volumes LOOK at the track listing. A lot of the songs are on multiple discs, then ask yourself, do I want this cd for the tracks I don't already have? You might be better off purchasing the missing tracks via digital download."
"Relax with This or Any Edition <SEP> Blank & Jones have perfected the chill album with this release as well as the previous 6 before it. If you are new to Blank & Jones, buy all seven and prepare to wow your guests with your excellent musical taste."
Five Stars <SEP> This song.....!
"but Jack's cover is great. Well done sir <SEP> Not really a U2 guy, but Jack's cover is great. Well done sir!"
"Rockin' <SEP> I love this song. It was on the soundtrack for The Great Gatsby, the new version, and I heard it on the speakers in the lobby of the theater and couldn't buy it quick enough. I looked at other Jack White songs but they were nothing like this one."
Five Stars <SEP> Perfect for our special event.
"Waste of money <SEP> This album consists mostly of cheap, shortened synthesized knockoffs of the actual performances, with a mix of unknown generic ""Olympic""-sounding themes. If I could get a refund, I would. I have to wonder whether the producers even got permission from the U.S. Olympic Committee to use the word ""Olympic"" for such a poor-quality product."
item description wrong? <SEP> I am confused. Reviews say these are dice but the item listing says it is an audio CD. I want the dice!!
NOT true BuK!!!  Saludos & try something else! <SEP> Not up to Bukowski standards.  Mean & cruel recording!  Bad audience ruins this album.
"If no one plays this song on New Year's of ... <SEP> If no one plays this song on New Year's of 3000, I will rise from my grave and punch someone."
"Brilliant Concept. Bad Vocals. <SEP> Little's Steven's ""Men Without Women"" is a classic album so when I saw this album I could barely contain my excitement. I purchased it without even listening to it. The Jukes are fantastic as always but Johnny's voice is completely shot during this performance. He struggles mightily but it's a raspy croak all the way thru. I don't know why they released this performance. Huge letdown."
Ain't nothing like the real thing! <SEP> Piss poor attempt to the original by the great Jerry Goldsmith. John Beal is a rip off
disappointed <SEP> Not what i expected. Liked two songs a lot and two more were ok. The rest i could ignore. regret buying it.
"Highly disappointed.... <SEP> I expected more from Mr Gardner and so I bought this album without thinking twice. I had been waiting on it to drop badly. Boy was I in for a rude awakening!

Just a punch of auto-tuning and every song being a repeat of the previous song. They all sound the same  Wow.....I'm so sad '
In my opinion of buy, try, or don't buy....I say try. Sample every song several times before making a decision to buy.

To me, the best song on the album is a touch up of one of his old songs ""closer"". sigh...."
Five Stars <SEP> Heard this song on weeds had to have it
Four Stars <SEP> I like this song a lot.
"Here I Am <SEP> This is a favorite of mine from Mark Heard. Hardly anybody knows him or his work but as long as he was in a soft rock or rock mode, I was always there for him. Really a wonderful weaver of words and song and Christian philosophy softly spoken. Mark is sorely missed."
Horrible! <SEP> Horrible!
"Wunderbare deutsche Schlager <SEP> Genau warum ich die Musik Reiner Kirsten gerne hre.  Ich wollte die CD zuerst von drben bestellen, aber ich fand es sogar hier bei der Ami-Amazon per download billiger.  Wie immer, wenn ich deutsche Schlager hre, ist es fr mich echt ein Stck der Heimat!  Ich dieses Album Ihnen empfehlen."
"Not for avid opera fans <SEP> This album sounds like karaoke'd opera. Maria Romo's voice although pretty, lacks control and focus. It sounds like a voice lesson, especially with her selections. Maybe it's the synthesized backing tracks. Let her husband continue to produce Lady Gaga, he shouldn't touch classical music at all; and I hope Maria hasn't quit her day job. Her voice needs more work."
It Must Be Vikki <SEP> Great overview of her career. CD includes her songs from the Matt Helms movies and Peyton Place. Great 60s nostalgia.
"Spirit of Tashi Jong Part 1 <SEP> I like a lot of Curtis McLaw and Dancing Fantasy and when I was cruising for new music of what I like I found Spirit of Tashi Jong Part 1.  The first two or three minutes of this over 40 minute piece is okay, but when I found that the entire 40 or so minutes was almost the same as the first two or three, I was extremely disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Sunshine Mama"
"Bad audio quality, NOT CLEAN <SEP> BUYER BEWARE! This version is not completely clean! At minute 1:39 it says ""whiskey d*ck"", it's not censored!

I don't actually hate the song, but the compression is so strong that even Youtube sounds better, the whole purpose of actually buying a song is to have a clean, unprocessed copy of the material, I know the goal is to make it louder and louder, but really, Youtube sounds better than this file."
A LAUGHABLE WAY TO LOOK AT THINGS <SEP> Lots of laughs. Some about impeachment.
WWE: Somebody Call My Momma  (Brodus Clay) <SEP> I would highly recommend this song to anyone who has little kids and likes to dance. It is a very fun song and my kids love to get down to it!
"Amazing <SEP> Amazing song. Very powerful message. Beautiful piano. I was choking back tears, not sad tears. Though the song is really sad. Its more because its such a powerful and moving song with strong punchlines and one hell of a messagethat can actually be looked at from many other angles"
"I LOVE Paramore!!! <SEP> I was told to listen to this song, only because I love their second album. I was told that it was just as good as Riot! had been. Here are my pros and coms:

Pros:
1) No cursing or cussing. I like music that is clean, but I don't like cleaned up songs. I like the full explicit songs. But if the original song doesn't curse or cuss, I'm fine with it.
2) I like the music. The drumming and guitar is amazing. I really love the vocals.

Cons: NONE!!!

Bottom line: GO BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!"
"Dark and spooky! <SEP> I DJ movie premieres, and I was able to DJ the Batman midnight showing in Arizona.  This was a great addition to my song lists.  Hanz Zimmer's dark sound will leave the listener wanting more!"
Five Stars <SEP> love it
"FRUSTRATED!!!!! <SEP> I am so aggrevated, ALL of their listings for randy ortons ""voices"" theme song all start the same, often mp3 meant for ringtones will start a different parts of the song as people have different prefferences, I am REALLY looking for one that STARTS with the chorus!!!!!! For my phone! Get with the program Amazon!"
"Love Tchubirabirom! <SEP> I purchased this CD solely because after viewing a fellow instructor and then the YouTube video of Parangole performing Tchubirabirom, I wanted to include it in my Zumba Gold class playlist."
"Great Songs if only the mp3s weren't corrupted, preventing me from listening. <SEP> Just bought this album but the MP3's were corrupt on my cloud and on my pc, preventing me from playing them. Perhaps it is because of the misspelling in the title (F?llakzoid instead of Fllakzoid). Other than that, the band is great and this poor review does not reflect on these amazing musicians."
Five Stars <SEP> Good music
R-TRUTH song <SEP> It's a decent song
"Living the American Dream <SEP> After staying up all night to download the album, I was let down. But like always we found a way. One of the best albums I've heard. Last Time and the American Dream are definitely my favorites!"
Great Song I like it <SEP> Great Song I like it
"Oops <SEP> Brought it by accident, not even the great themes from top wrestlers. Do not spend your money on this mess."
I did not actually ordered this. My son was ... <SEP> I did not actually ordered this.  My son was browsing and was suppose to put this in his wish list and somehow click on the order it instead.  Digital orders should have a confirmation button since they get delivered right away.
must have <SEP> Classic throwback artist If you don't know who she is Google her Iconic voice its a must have in my playlist love n hip hop uses this Artist a lot on your show
Five Stars <SEP> Nice collection. I can listen to this just about any time and get a kick out it!
Five Stars <SEP> fabulous
hate the cloud <SEP> The last 3 purchases I made never got to my phone. I buy music for my phone so I can listen to it in airplane mode when it's on the cloud I can't get to it they've changed the Amazon site so that it always goes to the cloud I can't get it on my player I've wasted by my and my last repurchases I can't get them
almost flawless!! <SEP> Great Album!! Amazing music with great vocals and lyrical content. Andy Moor's Zero Point One is yet another example of why he is on the premier Trance artist
"The song is very good. to <SEP> Sorry to hear about Joey I'm going. to miss her. The song is very good
.to li"
"Exited, then disappointed in the vinyl quality. <SEP> I love this band. Ive followed them since their conception and Ive gotten two bad records of this album. Side A skips through every song and Side B skips through most of them. I was so excited to get this on vinyl, but so disappointed at the quality."
"Great music with a great message <SEP> More people need to hear these songs!  I have been listening and singing to these songs for several days straight and I really like every single song on this ""CD"".  The music is great and the lyrics are spot-on, quite clever!  Sadly most people are probably not informed enough to know what most of the lyrics are about.  I find humor in most of the tracks but it isn't ""comedy"" since the subject matter is deadly serious.  We need to take this country back.  We need smaller government with less interference in our business and personal lives.  It was a pleasure supporting ""The Voters"" by purchasing all these great tracks.  I suggest you do the same.  I hope they have enough material for a second CD, soon."
Why is this even an option? <SEP> This was the dumbest thing I could have spent money on.
"Far from the original music <SEP> This is not like the original generation 60. I thought to myself,  let just keep listening as it looks like a modern version, then there is an annoying break between every song.  It simply lack the smoothness song following each other of the original medley.  I am very disappointed."
"Elevating, uplifting, set at rest. <SEP> Elevating, uplifting,set at rest.
But I really miss that She doesn't have
the Lyrics of the song available to print out"
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
"This quality should be unpublishable <SEP> Has a friend ever proudly shown you a snapshot, explaining that it wasn't really his fault that it was out of focus and too dark and besides it was such a cool snap?  Unacceptable surface noise."
Great music <SEP> I really enjoyed these songs.  They are all very original.  I really liked the use of different instruments.  Thanks for sharing this with the world!
Great singing <SEP> Some of the greatest Christian music of the 20th century was produced by the Old Fashioned Revival Hour Quartet and Choir.
Five Stars <SEP> I don't speak German but I love the song.
Five Stars <SEP> love the island sounds
"wonderful! <SEP> this review is for the tallis fantasia only.  i love this piece and have several recordings, and this one has become my favorite.  the playing is fantastic and really brings out the lushness and beauty of this piece, and the sound quality is great, as well.  highly recommended!"
"Crazy by Roberta Gambarini from her album ""So In Love"" <SEP> Very tasty version of the Willy Nelson/Patsy Cline classic!.I downloaded this MP3 version after hearing it on a local Jazz station (KCSM Greg Bridges). Roberta never disappoints!
  pkoaktown"
"bad bad  bad <SEP> I have purchased bad cd's in the past.
But never one as bad as this.  This is so bad I can't even garage sale it."
"Need a good cry? <SEP> This song put into words how I felt when I lost my grandfather many years ago. It still has the power to bring me to tears every time I hear it, because I still think of him this way...and still miss him dearly."
Singable songs that 2-year olds love! <SEP> Excellent!
Beautiful songs and singing <SEP> My daughter had this CD for her daughter and I bought it and another by Elizabeth Mitchell for a friend with a newborn. The mom claims it keeps her from crying when it's on.
"Met my baby at the  . (BANG BANG, GOTCHA) . shoot'em up movies <SEP> That classic G-funk sound, the more you listen (for me) the more you enjoy hearing it. Mad respect to Mo B. Dick"
Five Stars <SEP> The most soulful version of this classic I have ever heard!
"Proper Deep House Here! <SEP> If you are like me deep soulful house music is hard to find these days.  This is really high quality deep lounge house.  It's much like the days of Naked Music and early Bargrooves.  Buy it, play it while driving to the beach! A must for true househeads!"
Five Stars <SEP> good album...
"Great new songs from blur <SEP> The original line-up of blur are back with two great songs.  These make a great synthesis of classic brit-pop era blur with what became their mature sound with the eponymous ""blur"" and ""13"".  'Under the Westway' is more of a ballad while 'Puritan' is a jaunty number that finds blur looking back to 80's punk/new wave.  For a buck a song you can't go wrong.  Like many of us who have been blur fans since the beginning, there is hope this is portending something more - an album of new songs perhaps.  A limited edition CD was release on blur's website containing these same songs, plus alternative versions of the same."
"Another Chartbuster! <SEP> Having seen the YFF more times than I could possibly count (starting with their first gig: a Seattle party at the Big House in 1984?) and being the proud dish owner of every release the band and it's individual memebers have ever released I'm here to tell you this thing ROCKS! Why?  you might ask. Well,  fellow good time enthusists, the answer is simple: It's what they do! They don't know how to do anything else. They got one suit and it's strong, so quite naturally they play to it. Who the hell wouldn't if they could play it like that.

Buy it. Live it. Love it. Play it at your friends.

And Scott, Jim, Tad, and/or Kurt? If any of you read this could you please get me a copy. I'm dying to hear it.

Your brother in rock,

Quim B. Quiver"
just all right <SEP> Not great. The vocals get in the way of what works have been a better remake. Should have kept it instrumental.
Great song <SEP> Love Mint Condition ..love this song!
Too bad we didn't see much more from The Blue Shadows <SEP> Godspeed Billy Cowsill.  Your peaks and valleys collided in this era.  This song is very smooth.  Too bad we didn't see much more from The Blue Shadows.  A lot of potential was there.
Right Now <SEP> This is the first song of his after meeting him that I fell in love with. I love the video as well.
"I love this song <SEP> I love this song.  The blending of the modern instrumentals (love those strings) with the traditional rhythms is such a refreshingly funky break from the usual tunes that are available.  This track in particular carries me away to another place in my imagination. My hips start to sway, and I'm off. I'm no longer sitting in my car in traffic, I doing this funky dance from the waist down that no one can see.  I don't understand a word Hamdaoui is saying but I sure like the way he says it.  Expand your horizons..buy the whole CD..I did."
"Good version <SEP> I'm not a bluegrass music fan at all, but have always enjoyed the original version of this song. When I heard this rock version I had to have it. It's quite different, but very good."
"Terrific Music <SEP> Outstanding disc; Malka is an engaging vocalist with a lot of ""warmth"".  The instrumentation is superb, with most tunes having a somewhat electronic-pop sound, and very capable performances.  Great songwriting also.  Just buy it, you won't regret this choice!"
"Good Music, I imagine Bade delivery - I never got it !! <SEP> I am sure Paul Williams' music is wonderful, it always has been.  But Amazon failed miserable at delivering it.  I do not have the music and not sure why.  They talk abut a cloud, I want it on my computer not up above slipping by in little puffs.  I should have, and will, buy this on a CD from Paul's web site."
"Paying Excellent Tribute to the Clash! <SEP> I love the groove!  As any tribute should be, it's the perfect mix of the Wallflowers' sound and the Clash's sound!  Jakob doesn't over-do the lyrics, they just flow.  Highly recommend it!"
"Fantastic <SEP> Honestly, I don't care if it sounds like The Clash. I don't listen to The Clash. I listen to The Wallflowers. This is everything that got me into The Wallflowers: catchy beats, great lyrics, and Jakob Dylan's smooth, unique voice.

If you're into that sort of thing, get this song. Heck, they even offered it for free."
Quintessential track <SEP> I never tire of listening to this track. It evokes the spirit of this beautiful film - uplifting and inspirational.
"Not as it is advertised <SEP> This is actually a single 22 minute MP3.  The description makes it sound like it is a number of 20 minute sections, but it isn't.  Not sure why all those other titles are listed, as it is very misleading.  I DO like the Weight Loss part, but what I thought I was buying was not what I got.  $8.99 is high for a 22 minute MP3."
Horrid pretender of the fantastic Michael Buble. <SEP> Michael Bubble cannot carry a tune! This is NOT Michael Buble. Truly awful. I'd expect this terrible knock-off to be sued off the planet.
Love this song! <SEP> The lyrics are very catchy and I love it. I can't stop listening to this song. Keep on making more music S3RL!
"Brilliant! <SEP> This is a brilliant piece of music. Ashby is so in tune with her bass man and drummer. I can listen to this song on loop. Pete Rock sampled this song for his track ""The Boss""."
"Awesome <SEP> This is a great summer anthemwith a grest beat. Makes me want to roll the windows down, smile, and have fun."
Worth a buck for sure! <SEP> This song is dope as hell. Down since day one!
great song <SEP> Really like the song
"Maybe the best song on the record <SEP> Maybe the best song on the record, not as sickly sweet as ""Friday I'm In Love"" which can be hard to take after a few listens"
"One Star <SEP> worst elvis impersonation I have ever heard, would like my money back"
Five Stars <SEP> This songs speaks volume to our everyday living in society.
cool <SEP> Hot beat
"Very Happy with this purchase <SEP> The jury is still out as to whether this has impacted my confidence, but I do listen to it every night with headphones on as I am sleeping. I figure it can't hurt to give it a try and I do seem to sleep better, so that is a plus."
"Ripoff Alert! <SEP> First there was the EMI Beethoven 9th Bayreuth live fraud, then this Wagner SACD rip off. This wk1 contains only 4 selections, not 8, as in the 2cd counterpart. And the sticker price! Amazon must share the blame for not truthful disclosure."
ah memories <SEP> Turning on Dr memento back in the day was the best experience. This collection brings back every song I remember in original recordings. Everything  in one. A huge hole missing in my collection of vinyl.
"Ripoff Alert! <SEP> Don't get duped into buying wk1 and wk2 and think you get the SACD counterpart of the famous 2-cd set.
This SACD contains 5 or 6 selections. Wk1 has 4."
One Star <SEP> Didn't really work for me.
I signed up for his newsletter to see what I ... <SEP> I signed up for his newsletter to see what I thought but when he started sending email info on the Dark Art of Hypnosis and how to get women to take their clothes off I was sickened so I unsubsbcribed.  How creepy and sick.
One Star <SEP> Too long to follow...
"an ocean induction and very tedious to go through <SEP> Too long, an ocean induction and very tedious to go through, and the suggestions are useless for me, maybe they work for someone else. I'd suggest going to a real hypnotherapist. I just thought this would be fun to try."
"why is the entire thing about an ocean?? ... <SEP> why is the entire thing about an ocean??? Why do they think that an ocean is the most peaceful place? Also, this is way too long. His used to be 30 minutes, and this takes an hour."
"worthless <SEP> guess I just managed to purchase the intro segment--utterly worthless, should only be available when purchasing the full CD"
useless <SEP> no effect
None of these really work for me <SEP> None of these really work for me
"PIUTTOSTO ANDATE AL CINEMA!!!!! <SEP> Ho comprato questo cd senza aver ascoltato neanche una canzone ma solo xch mi ispirava il nome del gruppo e vi assicuro che se sceglievo di andare al cinema o a mangiare una pizza i soldi li avrei investiti meglio! Non riesco a decifrare neppure il genere musicale di questo gruppo che mescola suoni fastidiosi a cozzaglie musicali senza senso. Mi piace ricercare gruppi e album sempre nuovi perch quello che trasmette la radio o la TV  troppo limitato, ma stavolta ho fatto proprio FLOP. Per fortuna che mi  costato l'equivalente di 8 euro e quindi faccio finta di averli regalati a qualcuno o di averli persi....Ma se il rischio  il vostro mestiere correte subito a comprarlo, non sia mai che schizza in vetta alle classifiche dei dischi pi venduti davanti agli U2 o Michael Jackson! P.S.: la stella che gli ho messo  perch ho cliccato il mouse sulla prima stella e non so come fare x cancellarla, pensate se per errore andavo sulla 5 e si beccava il massimo dei voti....."
"tape was not on original ""scotch"" brand reel or vintage ... <SEP> tape was not on original ""scotch"" brand reel or vintage cardboard box, it was shipped in a cracked plastic box. the tape itself was already pre-recorded on, which I understand, but it was broken up into 8 or 9 sections and not spun onto the 7"" reel smoothly. very disappointing."
Five Stars <SEP> Please with
Five Stars <SEP> Great songs.  Great singing.
"perfect medley <SEP> If you love the music to Ben Hur and don't want to buy the entire soundtrack album, this is for you. It contains all the main themes from the film"
"A nice addition for video creations <SEP> Was just right for the Europe trip my wife and I made last fall. Added the national anthem to pictures taken in France to Movie Maker software in Windows Essentials. Used Sony camcorder, extra batteries, charger , Cyber Link Power Director all purchased from Amazon with very satisfactory results"
"Class Act <SEP> Music by this performer rates with the best or our time and with the best of past times, listening to track from this great album reminded me of listening to it on vinyl."
"JIMMY DEAN NONET MASTERPIECE <SEP> This is the (uptown) country album that old groaner Mr. Crosby never quite made, and it is Mr. Dean's supersmooth countrypolitan masterpiece, his best work on record. He had been typecast in hit topical and story songs for too long, and in 1965 Columbia, cashing in on Dean's television exposure (and Ray Price's successful uptown redirection masterminded by Don Law), rewarded the singer with this full-scale Western/roots/folk extravaganza. The coproducers are Don Law and Frank Jones, the very urbane orchestra charts (no steel guitar but lots of harmonica) by Streisand associate Peter Matz, and Dean's Crosbyesque crooning is bolstered robustly by eight male ""Chuck Cassey Singers"" (they are very good in their faux-Sons of the Pioneers roles).

The title is presumptuous (Willard Robison's ""Moonlight, Mississippi"" is hardly well known but should be) but cozily reassuring, and the playlist includes, along with the ancient ""Aura Lee,"" ""Home on the range"" (very affecting in these nonet harmonies), ""Shenandoah"" and ""Carolina moon,"" wonderfully bumptious uptempo takes on ""Blues stay away from me,"" ""Fort Worth jail"" and ""White silver sands."" It's a great programme, not to be found on any other Dean (or Crosby) album, and besides the Robison song the keeper track is Johnny Bond's ""Cimarron (roll on)"" in its definitive version where Dean, Matz and the chorus really have their act together in a barrelling river/railroad treatment. I'm not a Jimmy Dean follower, but I do respect the artistry and production excellence embodied here. There may have been more musical depth in this Dean feller than we previously suspected; this album is a treasurable listening experience."
Crank It Up !! <SEP> A Fantastic Live Concert Musical Experience ! ... crank in your car kiddies
Rock Appreciation <SEP> Classic live performance that still incites raucous rock appreciation.
"THIS is the one to buy! <SEP> Because the covers are almost the same, be sure to buy this edition.  It is a 2 CD set with the contents of the Horace Silver album plus 2 more.  All three albums are treasures.  It's the same instrumentation as the Modern Jazz Quartet, but with more life and propulsion.  You can't imagine the Mastersounds performing in tuxedos! These are some truly fine and adventurous musicians.  Modern Fender Bass players should go to school on the way Monk Montgomery plays the instrument.  The 3 albums in one CD case is a real steal."
"Old Times <SEP> so happy I found this for my husband who is battling Leukemia!!! Thank You. I wish they also had the CD in this, would definitely buy it!!!!"
"One of the best FM Radio stations out there! <SEP> Love the KHUM-FM!
A rare gem indeed!
Truly a ""Radio without the rules""!"
"Always experimenting! <SEP> It's great that there's someone still out there that's trying out new ground for Punjabi music, but the problem with exploring new ground is that it doesn't always work. Shinda's previous album Jadoo also opened new grounds for Punjabi music, as did this one; only problem is it loses charm. This is a great album for the Punjabi music industry, it breaks traditional norms with new styles of tracks, but most tracks fail to be melodious and catchy. Shinda's albums have always been melodious and catchy, which is why his song ""Khushiyaan"" from his most successful album Balle is now immortalized as a MUST PLAY at any wedding/party. The Music Man knows his roots, his music breaks new grounds all the time, BUT his next album should go back to his original style of catchy dance numbers and beats that make your car shake [Panjabi Clap-Balle/Soni Lagdi-Gal Sunja]. Tracks that are a MUST HAVE though are:
Rock Da Party - Unique production behind this one, great new listen
Saari Raat Nachdi Rahi - follows along the same line as Aao Giddha Pa Ley Eh [Living the Dream], Mere Munde Nu [Jadoo]
Mucch Khari - Another unique production, desi feel to it, but a hip-hop beat to accompany it. old school yet modern
Lorh Na Pendhi - straight up desi track
Hurrr - BEST ON THE ALBUM. MUST HAVE. I would pay 9 bucks for this song alone. Check the video out for it as well on youtube, Jazzy B makes an appearance on both the track and in the video ;]

Overall, it's a must buy, not because it's a Sukshinder Shinda album, because it's an album that dares to try new things while others recycle and ghost produce. 4/5 MUST BUY."
When you can't sleep at night. <SEP> I absolutely adore Of Mice and Men and this has to be my favorite behind Second and Sebring by them.
"This is the best one in the Faith Hope Love trilogy. <SEP> I have all three albums in the Faith Hope Love trilogy and the Eutopian Remixes, and this is best purchase of all four. You can listen to this from beginning to end. All songs are obviously Christian, as opposed to just inspirational. I'm not opposed to inspirational, it's just not what I'm looking for right now.

The album starts off with ""Faith,"" which is an upbeat anthem. The repetition of Phillipians 4:13 ""I Can Do All Things Through Christ Who Strengthens Me"" makes this a soul stirring piece that would be perfect for working out or finding encouragement. It features rapper Conscience, who sounds like he's channeling Outkast, in a good way.

The second song, ""Can't Have My Soul"" is one of my favorites. It also provides a mantra, ""You Can't Have My Soul."" I'm crazy about the beat, which is both old school and completely new at the same time. This song's message is about fighting temptation and not conforming to the world. A simple song, it touches on complicated topics like abortion.

Next is another favorite ""Love is All."" This is also included in the Eutopian Remix album, and it is an awesome song in both applications. This sounds like it could be a Toby Mac song, honestly. I love TobyMac, so it's not an insult at all. This song isbased on 1 Corinthians 13, or the ""love texts."" It's about loving the people in the world, even if they do you wrong.

We move on to ""Boom Shaka Loka"" which I personally think is a filler song. No real message, this what I call a ""get Christian crunk"" song. It's just about dancing and encouraging. The hook is ""I'm on top of the world and I can't come down."" It basically saying the world can't touch you. It's like CatchAFire by Tobymac. Doesn't really make sense, it's more about the feeling of the music. Not a favorite, but I like it okay.

I love the lyrics of the 5th song ""Hot X Cold."" It's about making a decision in your life to serve God and warning against being a lukewarm Christian. The same ""don't let the world have your soul"" message continues here.

The mood completely switches on ""In Your Hands."" This is more Christian contemporary; its the most traditional song on the entire album. It's a praise song, and it's good, but forgettable.

""Whoa Whoa Yeah Yeah"" has the catchiest, simplest hook; I found myself singing it under my breath after one of my first listens to the entire album. This is about proclaiming your trust in the Lord. It's the perfect ending to an album entitled ""Faith.""

Though I may not be crazy about every single song, this is one of few albums that I can let ride without skipping a track. It's really good, the sound is different, the beats and production are good, and the lyrics are timely. If you're debating which Je'Kob album to get, start with this one."
Terrible sound <SEP> The sound quality was very low with this recording for a MP3.  I found the recording by Mariachi Vargas to be of much better quality.
"marco barrientos album ulumina <SEP> That's a good album I recommend to everyone.
And if u like the rock this will be a good way to go for it and get Jesus in to u heart."
"Good music, good heart of worship/Buena musica, buena corazon de adoracion <SEP> I really appreciate Marco Barrientos's heart of worship and the musical abilities of him and his group. Lyrics are great and inspirational, and I get to listen in Spanish while I'm working out at the gym. The energy level of a lot of the tracks is very helpful.

Agradezco mucho la corazon de adoracion de Marco Barrientos y su equipo de alabanzas. Tienen gran abilidades musicales, y sus letras son inspiradores. Le escucho cuando hago ejercicios al gimnasio, y me hace trabajar. Muchas de las canciones tienen mucho de energia."
"Never got it. It crashed my computer. Please ... <SEP> Never got it.  It crashed my computer.  Please refund charges.

"not to my liking <SEP> not good. Just crap honestly, pure crap..."
"Two Stars <SEP> I'm never, ever going to wake up thinking, ""I want to listen to the Seer today!"""
Four Stars <SEP> Pretty good CD
"Please retire. <SEP> Khia, it time for you to retire and that's goes for those other dumb boards Trina, Jacki-O, Diamond, Lil' Kim, Nicki Minjai, and that ugly skank Iggy and to all gimmicks. The music die along time ago."
"Fake <SEP> This album clearly shows Khia needs to move onto something else. She is a good comedian. However, all of the dissing for promo is unacceptable, it's 2012. Nicki Minaj, Trina, Lil kim, and Diamond are all winning. I think the music speaks for itself. It's fake. She cannot back what she is stating and that is why I cannot take her serious."
Five Stars <SEP> Very good CD collection
"Mislabled Songs <SEP> Kigame's music is definitely great! I had his music on cassette, and I now want to get some electronically.  One of my favorites is Wastahili.  Now, as I bought and downloaded some of the songs here, I realized the labeling is misleading. From 6-10 the titles are indeed for songs 5-9; therefore, Wastahili which should be # 10 is not available since what is playing is Wasisimua Moyo Wangu. This needs to be rectified as it is misleading to those who want to download the specific songs. That is the reason I give the rating I have. Once this is rectified, and I receive the song for which I paid, I will have no problem changing this rating."
"awesome step forward <SEP> I have always thought The Holy Mess were good, but nothing outstanding.  This record proved me wrong.  There is a new variety to their song-writing that has not been present on previous releases.  I have seen them live in the past and look forward to seeing them perform songs off this new album, I would probably like to give it a 4.5, but 5 stars is a worthwhile rating in my mind.  If you like gruff vocals and jangly guitars, you should check this out."
"""Loved for His Music and Personality""Amado por Su Musica y Personalidad"" <SEP> Excellent Music and Song from Tony Croatto
Excelente Musica y Canci&oacute;n de Tony Croatto"
great song <SEP> Great song glad I found it after all these years!!
Love the song <SEP> I wish the sound was stronger though.  The recording of the song is very soft and i have to put the volume way up to really enjoy it.
"Switching to Amazon Music <SEP> I'm just getting started with replacing my iTunes with Amazon Music,  it will take a while.  I like the having this feature with Amazon"
"Who Else Thought the Artist was Peter Gabriel?! <SEP> Simply put, I wouldn't be happy with anything but a full refund for this underhanded tactic! The actual Peter Gabriel recording is what I was looking for, not another artist singing one of his songs. And yes, I'm rating the bait-and-switch tactic used, as well as the mediocre rendition of the song."
"ok <SEP> I see that there is a love for David Sanborn, but I am not really appreciating it since there isn't a need for it in my life right now.  It is a different. sound."
"I bought this cd as parte of my collection, ... <SEP> I bought this cd as parte of my collection, but the cd had stickers in every part, even in the front cover, directly in the paper, inise de cover, directly glued to the paper too, the cd was writed with a marker."
Used during worship <SEP> Great Song Makes you think  We need to accept Jesus Christ and be ready to join him in heaven just as the song says
One Star <SEP> Cannot understand words
One Star <SEP> Not very funny same people in all valls
GREAT CD - I DID SLEEP LIKE A BABY <SEP> Awesome CD.  Mr. Sutphen is a legend.  Very honest and well intentioned man.  Thank you.
"One Star <SEP> My wife did not like, nor enough  music that she liked"
"UUUUGGGG <SEP> This gave me  a head ache, I realized that the perfect 5th is not perfect for every one. I much prefer a minor 3rd or a flated 5th, but that perfect is a no-go for me. I tossed it in the trash."
"Lucc is right: ""Just how you like it!"" Whataburger!!! <SEP> My first purchase from this artist and it was fantastic! I love Whataburger and this homage to Whataburger by LUCC is definitely worth purchasing. Great job!!!  I wish they had Whataburger up in the Pacific Northwest - I'll be satisfied with Whataburger Working!"
"still just spots <SEP> I really, truly wanted to like this. I like the intro and about the first 15 sec but then for whatever reason I lose interest and think, ""what am I listening to?"""
"Terrific album, & her voice honestly gives me the ... <SEP> Judith Hill is the real deal & has the chops to back it up. Terrific album, & her voice honestly gives me the goosebumps, especially when she digs down and sings from her lower register. Good funk (*any* modern funk) music is really hard to find these days, and she really is exquisite. Hope to hear more from her in future."
Judith Hill Rocks <SEP> Great song. Great artist. She has an amazing voice and the song i love it! Hope Judith Hill makes more music. I imagine her albums are really good.
"Hauntingly addicting <SEP> Home-grown talent, like a trip back in time, Loved by anyone eight to eighty.
Keep up the good work SHEL."
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
One Star <SEP> Wasn't the song I thought it was. :(
"I was disappointed. <SEP> I thought this was the original, but was a cover. I was disappointed."
Sorry <SEP> Not my fave
"The Widowmaker by the Navigators <SEP> This is a fun song to listen to and they tell a good story as well. The Navigators are a great band and put on a good show.  If you are ever in St. John's New Foundland make a point to find them at one of the local bars on George Street, you will have a good time. The whole album is awesome."
Judith !!! <SEP> G-R-E-A-T
I love this song. Udit Narayan Jha's voice not to mention the lyrics. <SEP> I love to listen to this song. Udit Narayan Jha's voice is so wonderful! When you listen to him sing you can hear the smile in his voice.
"Time Fades Away <SEP> I greatly admire Neil Young and have followed his career since almost its beginning. This CD contains little known songs of his, in concert. It seems he can do no wrong (artistically speaking). He's a good person, as well, and I have read his well written autobiography. (I had never heard the soundtrack, ""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" included on the disc, so experiencing that was also a great treat.)"
Poor sound <SEP> Pay $50.00 to hear this girl sing? I'd rather listen to my lawn mower for free. People made a big deal of this girl. What do expect little girls to sound? Like Dolly Parton? Give me a break.
"razakel is the dopest dead bitch <SEP> if your a juggalo lette you will love the wickid queen
if i had to compare her music to someone, it would have to be to say the female version of twiztid or psychopathic records
if u like the wickid s***, buy all her music, you will be sorry if you dont"
Five Stars <SEP> Hans Zimmer's work never disappoints me!
Not TDNR Music I was hoping for <SEP> I can see why now this was left out of the CD not dark knight music its a Dance mix but a really bad one. I do not recommended this for DKR Fans.
"Love this version <SEP> I love the originality. Listen to the way she mixes styles. Perfect rendition. She grabs hold of you from the first two words out of her mouth. Not to mention, I have always thought this artist is a powerhouse!"
Five Stars <SEP> The absolute BEST version of Afro Blue EVER recorded.
"This is NOT the cd ""The Best of Today's Country Line Dance Favorites"" and does not ... <SEP> This is NOT the cd ""The Best of Today's Country Line Dance Favorites"" and does not contain the exact same songs as listed in the ad. If you look closely at the picture of the cd in the ad you will see it is actually ""Today's Country Line Dance Favorites""; which has most of the same songs also performed by the Highliners. These are two different cds that are somehow mixed together in this ad."
love the mix <SEP> The richness of this song has me telling folks to 'walk on by' with a smile. Great old school and new school mix....
"One Star <SEP> It was the instrumental version, which it didn't say, so I paid for a song and received that."
Not worth the purchase <SEP> Meh
Great.. used for a sweet 16 <SEP> Great..used for a sweet 16.
Two Stars <SEP> um just what. i don't really get this at all
One Star <SEP> Sucked. Just instrumentals . Boooooo
Just Ok <SEP> Good beat.....thats about it. If you are into lyrics that are kinda like skipping record you may like this song
"What happened here? <SEP> Guys, something went wrong.  The melodies are bland, the instrumentals are prefunctory and loaded down with the same electric guitar drowning everything out, the lyrics range from mediocre to annoying.
  You all are better than this.  You're ISC, for cryin' out loud!  Pull out your notes from La Parade Monstureuse, Holy, Mistrust the Angels, etc, and regroup.  This is worse than FLA's Flavour of the Weak.
  Seriously, just... make the next one awesome again and we'll pretend this never happened."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"didn't care for it, thought is was the one ... <SEP> didn't care for it , thought is was the one Aretha made."
"love this song <SEP> this version is wonderful and very smooth. I love the singer's voice. The rest of the CD is very good as well, but this song is particularly great."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
"One Star <SEP> Sorry for a bad review, but one of the cd's would not play."
"hate it <SEP> This was not what I ordered... I like the song, but not this fake song that they sold me... I was tricked"
Love this song! <SEP> I loved this album. Changes was the best song on it.  I love when you can find a song that describes how you are feeling when you couldn't find the words yourself
"standard <SEP> I never received these songs, something went wrong with the download process. so it erased 250 songs.  now i have no music. signed very upset..... is there anyway to save on my account to download again....or do I have to pay again???"
"A Happy Accident <SEP> I had never heard of Gina Sicilia before and one day, as I was cleaning house, I was listening to the Blues music channel on t.v. and heard this song!  I said to myself, ""I HAVE to have that"" and I ran straight for my computer and downloaded it !!!  I'll be purchasing more of her work."
"Eric Gales is one of the best ""unknown"" rock and roll guitar players on earth. <SEP> One of the most exciting live performers as well.  He plays his guitar ""upside down"", like another Guitar God - Jimi, and he can channel Hendrix like no other currently living guitar player."
Four Stars <SEP> This is my dad's favorite episode of this awesome show.
"Leicester Bangs Review (2012): <SEP> The Porchistas - The Baby Album (Independent)
From Montclair, NJ, The Porchistas are an interesting proposition. They combine an accessible, retro, pre-hardcore punk sound with island vibes, folk-rock and a gritty New Jersey demeanour. They're worldly and wordy, with plenty to say, but seem perfectly comfortable with the concept of big pop songs. Songwriters Adam ""Devil Hands"" Falzer and Alan ""Sucia"" Smith bring a wealth of experience to the project. Falzer's studied Music Synthesis at Berklee School of Music, he sings, produces and plays lead guitar. Smith sings and strums an acoustic guitar, and enjoys making things out of poo and straw - houses I think, rather than boiled sweets. Drummer Jonathon Riordan and bass player Gerry Griffin complete the line-up.

As far as I can ascertain ""The Baby Album"" is the band's third long-player, which they begin with ""Friends in the Underground"". It chugs along like a well-bred Dead Boys' number, with just enough sneer on the vocals and what sounds like a saxophone solo - and it's catchy as hell. ""Tooty Tooty Ta"" is a Cracker-esque tree huggers call to arms that alternates between ramshackle country rock and rickety indie-cowpunk. Again, you will sing-a-long. ""Make a Wish"" reveals a Caribbean bent and ""Zombie Jesus"" won't makes friends amongst the faithful. ""Frankly, You Can Thank Me"" sounds like a title Morrissey might have come up with, but it's nothing like a Smiths song. Instead it unwinds like a folky-post-punk Chili Peppers and I like it a lot. So a smorgasbord of sounds, styles and influences, yet it all comes together. I think I need to start checking out their back catalogue."
Five Stars <SEP> I love this music for sleep and meditation.  It is my kind of sound.
"Pointless exercise in sounds <SEP> here a note, there a note, short trivial phrases, no melodic development, wrapped in marshy sounds. Ad a lot of reverb, you have something like an ""atmosphere"", chose some titles evoking religious associations (""Eden"", ""Requiem""..) and you have even ""depth"". The result is unfortunately childish sound kitsch."
"Listen - Then Buy <SEP> This is a great sound. Hard to explain, but Jennifer Thomas is a great artist. Not only recommend this cut, but the album. You can listen to it over and over. Raises the spirit; soothing at the same time."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful musis
"Misleading label <SEP> Just so you know, this is NOT the explicit version as the title would make you believe. It's radio-edited. The song is great though, the stars are there as a warning."
One Star <SEP> Bad
"Didn't download, don't want it. No review. <SEP> Another item I didn't ask for. I don't even know how I got it. Don't want it."
"Great@@ <SEP> Great album with several good songs, better than first album. Hope artist does more like this. Illumination top song. this is my 3rd favorite on album"
"This song is awesome! <SEP> Regardless of what mood I'm currently in, this song will always energize me and make me happy. I love many of Rustie's instrumentals and this vocal track is very well done. It pushes the instrumental track over the top!"
"Great addition to my collection <SEP> If you are not familiar with this artist, he has created, produced and performed music his way. He does not conform to corporate measures and his style is all his own. I have enjoyed his music since his days with Darling Cruel and his solo work is outstanding. His lyrics and musicianship are superb and you won't be disappointed. I only wish that he would tour again in the US. Give him a listen and you too will agree, a great addition to your collection."
"More than just a Chili Pepper <SEP> Why oh why did Flea wait so long to release a solo album?!  I loved the track (""I've been down"") that he did for a soundtrack a few years back and this just an interesting, exploratory musical endeavour that steps outside of more traditional 'songs' as explored with RHCP.  This stands as a further testament to the breadth of Flea's musical vision, but also offers a tantalising ""what if Flea and John had been given freer reign for their weirder ideas in RHCP""

Suffice to say, don't expect funk or pop or anything remotely RHCP, this totally its own thing, and it's great."
"Good selection of music <SEP> I am happy with the music selection but there is no repetition of music for both sides of the barre! I am a bit disappointed, I have to repeat it manually and that interrupts my class flow....."
The Lost Tracks Hits The Spot <SEP> The Lost tracks is a well put together taste of this artiste's work.  I know him from the band 'Roots Underground' so it's nice to here some of his solo projects some of which they now sing within the group setting. 'The Lost Tracks' is an entertaining set.
"I was expecting the vocal song to the movie 'One ... <SEP> I was expecting the vocal song to the movie 'One Night With the King' not the instrumental...However, I got want I paid for...No one to blame but myself..."
"Love this band! Great new find. <SEP> First found out about Midi Matilda thanks to a blog post by [...].  So glad I did.  I've really grown to love this band and their unique sound.  Energetic and Pop but with great lyrics and production.  Buy this album, don't just stream it.  Watch their videos too, they have some really creative ones."
"Probably not what you think it is. <SEP> Be warned. I don't know where this cover comes from, but it is *NOT* the classic that we all know."
Five Stars <SEP> hell ya
"Great Song Great Album <SEP> Colt Ford just does GREAT work. We pretty much love all his stuff. Stradog and Suzee ""Q"" give this song and the entire album 5 Stars"
Five Stars <SEP> awesome song !!!! Anyone from PA can relate
They Are Called TBDBITL For A Reason <SEP> You can't buy a bad Ohio State Band album and this is definitely one of their best and is a classic! Get ready for the football season with this one!
"Who is in charge of quality control? <SEP> I love TBDBITL. I was so disappointed to download this cd and find more than half the tracks were mis-labeled. If it correctly identified all the songs, I could change my rating to a 5 star."
Five Stars <SEP> LOVE LOVE LOVE this!
"Definetly not Classic Lynch Mob <SEP> I followed Onis solo career you can definetly tell he had a lot more to do with songwriting on this ep. Melodic yet rockin tune,"
Five Stars <SEP> This is an awesome song!
"Bird, Budgie Chirping Sound FX <SEP> Very disappointed in this product.  Our Budgie was not impressed either.  Would not recommend this product.  Repeats same few sounds...not enough variation."
"Four Stars <SEP> I love this song, forest silence is so magical."
"Crossing the line and carrying the torch! <SEP> Are you hesitant to purchase this amazing CD without first hearing a few sample tracks? (Audio samples weren't available at the time of my review.) DON'T BE ... BUY IT NOW. If you enjoy blues-based hard rock, fiery guitar playing and incredibly soulful ballads, buy it now. If you're a fan of Joe Bonamassa and his work with Black Country Communion, buy it now. If you're a fan of dearly missed blues-rockers Rory Gallagher and Gary Moore, please buy it now! Trust me, you won't regret it."
"More MICHAEL jACKSON <SEP> I am not having any problems with my purchase. I always liked this song, so I can play it when I on my computer which is often and enjoy it will working."
Wonderful <SEP> I loved this album.
"Powerful Worship Song! <SEP> ""Champion"" is a powerful song that causes you to reflect on and worship the nature of God.  He is our Holy and mighty Champion, always fighting our battles and giving us victory through Christ Jesus!"
Exactly what I needed <SEP> I was looking for this particular song for a presentation and really liked this particular version.  I will be getting more of their music.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent song!!! Captured the word with a catchy beat.
One Star <SEP> Very nice this song
Two Stars <SEP> only one song...
"Five Stars <SEP> Me gusto mucho su musica. Hace pensar que esta ahi, en el juego"
Five Stars <SEP> Dam good rock.
"It rocks! <SEP> If you are a fan of Pantera, you would most likely like these guys too. They have the big, heavy, Texas sound and I really like it."
Just....ok <SEP> I wasn't overly impressed with this CD.  I found myself getting very bored after the first couple of songs.  I actually don't listen to it all anymore.  Oh well...can't win them all.
Great alternative sound <SEP> This is a classic song.
truly amazing.. I've watched them from start to now <SEP> This band.. truly amazing.. I've watched them from start to now.. from youth to maturity.. and they never cease to amaze.. those two guys.. friends since they were kids.. and finding Mike's girlfriend to sing for them.. made the most spontaneous expression of eternally rad sounds and lyrics to guide to spiritual completion with exquisite clarity! ;)
"Still Relevant <SEP> Saint Etienne have released a very modern and also, somehow, a very nostalgia suffused album, no mean feat for a band on its 23rd year (give or take a few months). No other band, other than maybe the Pet Shop Boys, can do this and have it be authentic. A love letter to the music fan (take a really good look at the cover) in all of us, WAM does, indeed, sound like Saint Etienne, but a Saint Etienne that is still willing to take risks.

If you're a fan of SE then you should find this to be at the very least a good album (some here have not, and that's OK, they're entitled), and I expect it would also be a pretty good starting point for the un-initiated to get an idea of Latter Day Saint Etienne. Still dance oriented, still heart wrenching, still relevant.

Lastly, the 2cd deluxe editions of these fairly recent reissues are pretty much uniformly excellent. The 2nd discs of supplemental material is far from scraping the bottom of the barrel in most cases. The 2nd disc here is more interesting than essential, though, and probably the least essential other than the Underworld and Andrew Weatherall mixes. If I based my rating on the overall package I'd probably dock 1/2 a star for the 2nd disc, but what the heck, I'll round up! The booklet is excellent, the package classy and durable. Don't hesitate."
"Well's run dry. They don't even sound like Saint Etienne anymore. <SEP> I own most of Saint Etienne's works including Japan only releases and vinyl which cost me a bundle. Maybe the fact that they have taken just too long between their last album and this one, the creative juices have run dry. I understand people's comments about ""good writing"", however I don't agree with them about being good songs. Songs appeal to people by the way they are performed on the disc, the production, and the actual quality of the melody. Since I am not a poet, I don't give that much importance to words, just as long as they are not as stupid and repeated as what you would find on an ELO album. I love Foxbase alpha, the remix foxbase beta, finisterre and good humor. Some of their singles compilations have excellent material as well as well recorded B-side fillers, which come off as charming. However on this album, I hear a tired band, just recording an album as an excuse for a tour. This is not even an attempt to SOUND like Saint Etienne. Here they sound like any other overproduced indie band with the volume set to ""too loud"" when the album was mastered. There is not even an audiophile element here. It is all loud drum machines, synthesizers and fake guitars. This album and Metallica's ""Death Element"" (2008) are irrefutable evidence the Loudness Wars have claimed Saint Etienne as yet another victim. Also, there are too many writers and producers, which yield at best, a mediocre b-side compilation album. And I bought this album on LP form, so it hurt my pocket even more. I sold the album to a used record store and used the credit to but something else instead."
good bluegrass music <SEP> Very good band would like to see them live.
"THIS WAS AWESOME!!! <SEP> I heard the choir sing this LIVE yesterday and it was incredible! When they sang ""Never Late"" I couldn't help but be encouraged. ""He may not come when you want, but He's right on time..."" Great Stuff!"
not worth it <SEP> I thought i bought a song by the Hunter Hayes that wrote Storm Warning. This must be a different guy because it difnt sound like him at all.
"Yesterday today. New love and discovery. It's time again... <SEP> I was doing some late night channel browsing a couple nights ago and stumbled upon a band performing on the David Letterman show. I paused to listen because it sounded like days of old. I am a 42 year old man who began to fall in love with New Wave music in 1979. This exploded throughout the early 80's and through my teen years. I was attracted to the vast style and subject that New Wave and Classic Alternative provided. I loved the sound of the original analog synthesizers and the non-traditional chord changes and progressions, and the endless variety of unique voices and found sounds. In the early 90's music was destroyed by Grunge and all of the other forgettable dreck that was being pumped out. Digital synthesizers even made electronic music boring. I was both disappointed and offended that the music that I loved so much was gone. I took time in the 90's to research and discover a vast array of lesser known Alternative artists from the 80's, and was able to expand my knowledge and collection extensively, but there's still only so far you can go.

About a month ago, I kept hearing a quirky song that sounded like it came out of 1981 art school. I finally found someone who knew the name of the song and it turned out to be ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" by Gotye. I don't pay attention to modern music so the only time I hear something is in passing. But sometimes things seem meant to be. Even though that song hit about a year ago, it just now came to my attention for a reason, and I was very excited by it. Even the music video had a retro flavor, ala Visage ""Fade to Grey"". By listening to The Chevin perform ""Champion"", I was startled, speechless, and very excited. When the broadcast was over I immediately went to YouTube and watched the music video. The most appropriate way to describe the song is breathtakingly stunning! I literally had tears in my eyes at how powerful this song is, and the retro style cannot be denied. I immediately thought of very early Simple Minds and very early U2. I played the video over and over and continued to have the same reaction, which I don't think I've had in countless years. The video also had some retro flavor in the form of several slow motion scenes and a lot of blank white background. All they needed to be totally early 80's was to shoot it on soft focus videotape, as opposed to film.

I looked up The Chevin on iTunes and found the ""Champion"" ep. I bought it, both on iTunes and on CD from Amazon UK because I love physical product, despite my reliance on my iPod. I just like to hold the item in my hand. I guess that's retro in itself. I see the band have a full length album titled ""Borderland"" coming soon. I listened to the samples and heard many other sounds, styles and structures that I fell in love with all those years ago, and that should have never gone away. I will snap up this album on release and will pay very close attention to what this exciting, young band produce in the future. There is something very exciting mixing around in music lately, and I need to start randomly exploring so I don't miss out on any other new talent who may be paying overdue homage to the pioneers from decades ago. I never thought I'd be able to say it but after hearing The Chevin, I've fallen in love again."
One Star <SEP> Did not even purchase this!!!!
beautiful <SEP> Such a lovely and peaceful song that will bring peace to your heart and mind as you listen.  I've enjoyed just leaving it on replay and just let it soak into me.  Very much a welcome rest break.
"One Star <SEP> Claimed to be in good condition, but the CD skips."
"can't wait for the next album <SEP> a beautiful, lush, and poignant song. her voice aches with longing and the sparse instruments are haunting.  definitely a great teaser of the album to come."
Just Right! <SEP> My wife has loved this piece starting the moment she first heard it. Anf now she can sing her interpretation herself.
My favorite track <SEP> Great conga solo by Kalani toward the end!  The entire album is high energy and uplifting but this is my favorite.
100 years of Gene Kelly <SEP> Gene Kelly would have celebrated his 100th birthday in 2012.  What better way to honor him than to purchase and listen to this wonderful album filled with songs he made famous.  This is truly a celebration of Gene Kelly's career.
"(not quite) Epic <SEP> You would expect an album touting itself as EPIC to be well, something grand.  Sadly the music is middle of the road at best.  Trailerhead: Triumph is a much better album."
Five Stars <SEP> Love Thier music could not be happyer with my purches
"Great movie, Powerful music <SEP> Rollerball is one of my top one hundred movies due to the soundtrack.  No other recording of Bach's Tocatta and Fugue sounds as good as this one."
"Not Used for Our Show <SEP> Only really purchased this for Hockey Pocky, but it sounds terrible, not light and fun!  Only purchased the whole album b/c it seemed like a good deal for the money and we might need the songs later."
CD <SEP> My nine year old daughter says it deserves five stars out of five.  She likes all the songs.  I have not yet listened to this CD.
"Kinda crap. <SEP> Her music is not that great. I paid .50 for this, because they unfortunately play this at my workplace and I felt that listening to it would help get it out of my head. It served its purpose."
"not good <SEP> Considering I'm a audio file,  the recording isn't bad. The cd is, no thing like her music from the early 90s,  the 1 cd I have from the 90s is kick ass, this is just ass."
"This was most disappointing & annoying. The said record was badly scratched <SEP> The LP record with this sleeve was not MEMORIES but an LP entitled An Evening with Fr. Sydney MacEwan on the Phillips label. This was most disappointing & annoying. The said record was badly scratched. Why should I have to go to the expense of returning this item when it was not what was offered for sale ? One buys one's experience,so never again !! Bad,bad,experience."
"Improving on excellent! <SEP> I didn't think it was possible, but this man has improved on EXCELLENT! He has an incredible voice... He can (and DOES)sing country, Broadway, opera and old-fashioned hymns in an unbelievable fashion. He has returned after a self-imposed hiatus of more than a 15 yrs and his voice sounds better than ever! This new offering, which he wrote (as he has many of his past songs)touches my heart as only a superior love song can. I am looking forward to see much much more from Mr. Morris in the future. Don't miss this single."
"Heartfelt tribute <SEP> Under-appreciated blues belter Big Maybelle tears your heart out with this.  The horn section accents her wails, the drums drive her higher.  A highly recommended tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
Didn't realize was for excercising <SEP> I love the song I am Free so I was thinking it was just a good Christian mix and didn't realize was for excercising.
Five Stars <SEP> The music arrangements is very good.
"Resonates.... <SEP> ""Keep The Wolves Away"" resonates with me. My father was hurt in a work accident and this song is exactly what happened."
One Star <SEP> Very Disappointing.
Five Stars <SEP> Definitely keeps you moving
Five Stars <SEP> good
"Ill keep my opinion Short.. <SEP> This CD surprised me, with its degree of Stellar talent.
The only negative I can Throw in.. is it Sounds a LOT like Tesla.. with Sammy Hagar out front.
Every song is stand alone strong, and the recording quality and mix is Perfect in my opinion.
This is one of my new ""FAV"" CD's of all time !! If you play guitar, or.. are just a fan of it.. This will
do you right.. All the guest guitarists.. are just icing on the cake !!
YOU NAILED IT FRANK !!!!"
Cruxshadows disappoint <SEP> I'm sorry I really loved the Cruxshadows for years and was so excited when this came to my house.  I forced myself to listen to the whole thing and am really sad that it sucks so incredibly badly.  Rogue - what happened?
Terrible <SEP> So I have no clue what dub step is and I am not up on current music trends but this is the absolute worst remix in the history of this world and possibly that of an alternate universe.  How can you take such a powerful song full of energy and turn it into a slow moving snail paced remix.  Some may like it but my personally it sucks.  I have heard other remixes and they are fantastic but this one grinds the ears to the point of spontaneous head explosion.
"Another Favorite <SEP> From a life-long fan of music, who cherishes his favorites, this is a fantastic recording. I spent countless hours with the original Del Rio release years ago. In fact, I revisit that record on my own regularly. I am way behind as I just learned of the new unplugged version (new to me anyway.)
I played this today for the first time and experienced something new in music. To my joy I  heard brand new music that I knew all too well with the exception of one added track. It was similar to buying an artist's/group's live album but much cleaner. In my opinion much better.
I can't say I like the new version more because truly love the original. This is as good for many reasons. The original release fit my life back then. This wonderful production fits today equally well.
Thank you Mr. Foster and all who brought this to life."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful voice. Relaxing music.
"A Downer <SEP> Terrible. I love Luciana but she made a mistake here. Chet Baker was a jazz trumpeter and vocalist who was also a heroin addict. These are the songs he used to play and sing. Using deliberately depressing arrangements, Luciana attempts to interpret Baker's deathly and painful heroin-induced world. It does not work and is certainly not worth the effort."
"Chet Baker reborn <SEP> She reincarnates chet's music and gives it a life born of her voice and her respect for the artist. Songs covered but,not. The whole album is one in which you sit down in a dimly lit room and sip"" Campari"" and soda with a twist of lime. Thinking to yourself how wonderful life truly is."
"Gotta love Etta May <SEP> She takes the character that Roseanne started, but with a lot more brains, heart, and humor. Gotta love Etta May!"
"Uncle Lucius plays DFW regularly, but I have not ... <SEP> Uncle Lucius plays DFW regularly, but I have not seen them. This song will  make me go next time they are here..."
"Do NOT buy this ""sound effect"" <SEP> What a waste of money.  IF this was actually a conch shell being blown, it's hard to tell, because it sounds like an absolute beginner trying to play the trumpet mouthpiece.  Simply awful. The worst sound effect in the world, very possibly.  It is tepid and timid and unskilled, not the rich sonorous sound of a conch horn well-blown.  Letting air out of a balloon would have made a more satisfactory sound than this!!!!  Do NOT waste your money on this sham!!! Run away!  I always give the benefit of the doubt unless it is proven that my trust is misplaced.  Well, whoever produced this pitiful, spit full, pip-squeak of a sound should be ashamed of themselves for including this in their collection.  i can only assume the rest of the sound effects album is just as bad as this one, because the quality is SO BAD that I will keep writing to convince you to not waste your money on this product.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME: it is about 2 seconds worth of the mealiest, mousiest, sputtering horn sound I have ever heard other than at a first lesson for a horn student.  This is one god awful horrendous production and Amazon should take this product off, it should be reported to the Better Business Bureau as an outright sham and theft of hard-earned money.  Sure it's only 99 cents for this one sample, but if you don't mind spending 99 cents to have your tooth pulled out with anesthetic, if you don't mind someone pouring putrid poop in  your ear and paying them 99 cents for the privilege, then go ahead and buy this sad sad sad sample.  Juvenile and pure junk, that's what this is."
"Good Version Just That <SEP> This new remake of an old song might be good for your workout. The quality and delivery is great, and only but only if you like Vanilla Ice you should have this track powered by Zumba Fitness. Not recommended if you are a Gold Zumba Instructor, is very fast."
not the song I thought I liked.. <SEP> I thought that this was a song I knew but it wasn't.  Wrong song by this artist. I did not like the song.
"Down South <SEP> Bedhed and Blondy are a Nashville based duet consisting of Jay Studdard and Fran Jackson.  The duet has just released their third CD, Down South, following last year's CD, Nuthin'.  This takes the duet back to their deep Southern roots and the outcome is a disc that is beautifully harmonious, and chock full of southern musical hospitality.

Studdard says of the album, ""Down South came out of a bunch of things I remember about growing up in middle Georgia.  The things my parents would say; the things I was expected to do or not do.  It's very autobiographical.  The motivation for most of these songs came from personal experiences. It's a complicated word and we tend to only complicate it more most of the time, which makes for lots of good material to write about.""

All of the nine tunes on Down South are great.  Three randomly picked Boomerocity favorites are:

The opening cut, Loving You.  Beautifully written, performed and recorded, this song is worthy of national radio play as well as some close attention by the country cable TV networks.  Yeah, it's that good.

A second randomly picked favorite is This Time Tomorrow.  Slow, bluesy, and just a little bit funky, this tune is worth multiple slaps of the repeat button.

The closing tune, Lullabye, is beautiful in its sentimentality, tugging at the heart strings of both the performers and the listener.  How many of us parents have said words like those written in this song as we sung our kids to sleep?

If you love great, smooth, easy listening, Southern grown music sung from the soul, then you will definitely want to get your copy of Down South by Bedhed and Blondy.  You're going to love it.

"WOAH ! ! ! <SEP> I am appalled. I heard nothing but a crazed monkey, jacked up on speed....
Or maybe a piano novice, trying to experiment with hammers and bowling balls on piano keys.
There is no hint of quality in this sheer madness.

I should have known there was something wrong when I could not hear any tune snippets (as with other music).
Had I been allowed to hear a few seconds of this trash, I would not have wasted my money."
"muddled and poor quality <SEP> I'm a DJ with a professional sound system, and I bought it because it's a good dance song. I couldn't use it because the sound quality was awful. Sounded like it was bring played under a pillow. I wouldn't recommend any one to buy this"
"Paper Tongues are just...great <SEP> I first found the paper tongues back on XM radio when their first album came out. I was instantly grabbed by the song ""Trinity"". After hearing it, I was hooked and have listened to the first album several times. Amen is a great follow-up. Somewhat of a different beat to it, it took me a little more to get used to. The chorus is catchy and Aswan does a great job on vocals as usual. If you haven't seen these guys live, go if you get the chance! They sound just like their albums and have a ton of energy on stage. Certainly a band to keep your eye on! Amen."
One Star <SEP> A CDR NOT A REAL FACTORY C.D. !
Not recomended <SEP> Music is low in terms of volume and doesnt sound lime original you would have heard back when it was aired on the radio
Two Stars <SEP> Not much to this at all.
Did not like the music - it made tinnitus worse <SEP> Did not like the music - it made tinnitus worse.  I have tried this before - for me not so good
Just bad intertainment! <SEP> the singer Dave Patten can not sing and the lerics are those of a 10-12 year old. The music is just bad.
AWESOME GROUP!! <SEP> This is one kick ass CD!! These guys know how to rock!! Love it!!! Can't wait til the next one!!!!!!
"An Experimental album gone terribly wrong <SEP> 1. Berry Can 7/10
2. Shark Suit 6/10
3. Jap Dad 5/10
4. Neolao 5/10
5. Castle 4/10
6. Green Starred Sleeve 3/10
7. Trapezeus 4/10
8. The Sun 4/10
9. Hum Jam 6/10

UUVVWWZ are an Experimental, Female Fronted, Post-Punk band that at times can sound Jazzy, bluesy, or generally unclassifiable. They are from Lincoln, NE.

I like to listen to a release at least three times before I post it as a review. Some releases take more than 3 listens to fully digest, and some are so good that I end up listening to them more because I just do not get a chance to review the CD quickly enough. Every now and again you come across a CD that it is a challenge to listen three times. UUVVWWZ's S/T CD is one of those CDs. It starts out pretty solid. Berry Can is a good song. Shark Suit is above average, but once you reach Jap Dad you notice that UUVVWWZ has Spastic even annoying tendencies. The CD begins to go down hill fast. Neolao is pointlessly long, and resembles a poor imitation of The Doors meets early Zeppelin. Castle is annoying and too long. Green Starred Sleeve is the worst song on the CD. The guitar work seems to be purposefully irritating and the vocals sound like meandering pretentiousness. Trapezeus is an attempt at rock and roll, but again the vocals KILL anything that might be considered redeeming. Finally, The Sun is irritating and Hum Jam shows that the band is capable of better work than they put forth on the rest of the CD.

The Major problem with UUVVWWZ is the vocals. Teal Gardner, the lead singer, refuses to control her voice. She needs to understand her vocal limitations and work within them. Unlike some artists, that she most probably idolizes, when she pushes herself beyond them the results are not appealing. If this band could reel themselves in they could probably put together a solid rock CD.

The song by song review is 49%, but when you factor in how inconsistent and annoying the CD is overall the review comes to 41%..

Great for the older soccer players <SEP> Nice filler for soccer video. Fit in with the action on the field. think they will love it and use it to motivate them for their games
YES! Recommended ... <SEP> These ladies have a beautiful sound. You should buy this ;o}
Two Thumbs Up! <SEP> I own 1000 copies of this album and I think its fantastic! Take the leap to own just one and you won't be disappointed! ; )
Not good <SEP> Just was not a good purchase. Very awful album. The ad in my opinion was somewhat misleading. Will not by from artist again.
Disappointed <SEP> Vinyl was just so so....and album cover the same.
"Kisi Nazar.. <SEP> LOVELY Melody. I keep playing it over & over again.  The voice , Lyrics, & the melody. ..all are superb!!"
Disappointed with the album they sent <SEP> Not happy at all with the record they sent me. I thought it was the original in used condition but turned out to be a VERY cheap re-issue that sounds just terrible...not happy
Bad file! <SEP> This track has a skip in it! Go buy it somewhere else!
"Not entirely impartial here...but still one connoisseur's view <SEP> I have been studying (yes...for aproposed book project) the popular folk-styled music (volkstuemliche Musik) of the Alps for the better part of three years and so have contact with a number of performers as well as know their music inside out. Stina,by trade a hairdresser in her native Kitzbuehel Austria, is a part-time performer whose range of songs goes from country (even one tune performed entirely in English!) to down-home sentimental songs in her local dialect (a variant of Bavarian). This short set gives a pumped-up overview of her styles (remixes of earlier tunes with a bit more edge and drive) and some nice new additions to her repertoire. Standouts especially include "" I steh auf di"" (in the more traditional vein) and ""Wenn das Ave Maria erklingelt"" (her Christmas offering) both new to this release. For those with an ear for good contemporary German sounds, this is bound to delight."
"Great Song! <SEP> This is a great song for dancing or just riding in the car bouncing your head. Three bears bass. Not too heavy, not too light."
Rip Off <SEP> $1.29 for 29 seconds of the song (and not even the whole song) is paramount to highway robbery!
Four Stars <SEP> Quality is great. Love these guys!
One Star <SEP> It's missing the last chord. Sounds incomplete!
"She could sing a list of the side-effects of a prescription drug and I'd listen to it. <SEP> There is no better voice making music right now. She is a master of making a cover song her own. This album of covers (obscure songs, mostly) is simply brilliant. I had never heard most of these songs before Rumer made this album...now most of these songs have become favorites. I've listened to many of the originals since, and I think she elevated them to a whole other level."
"Beautiful version of Daryl Hall's classic song. <SEP> Beautiful version of Daryl Hall's classic song.  I love the tone of her voice and this is sung with intense emotion.  If you are interested, look for the Daryl's House episode when Sara visits and sings this song."
"Hauntingly beautiful <SEP> This is one that I'll revisit for the rest of my life. For lovers of melancholic masterpieces, such as Funny Valentine, Summertime, and Shenandoah, you must give this a listen. As sadly beautiful as they come."
Too much chanting <SEP> Got this to use as background audio. Most of the audio is okay but the human voice chanting repeats so often in the six minute clip that it gets annoying. I also had to convert the clip from mp3 to wma to get the Windows Movie Maker to recognize it.
"I'm Listening Right Now <SEP> I'm listening to the CD now!!! It is soo Goood! I think I just might wipe off all songs on my Ipod except 2BP because, well why listen to anything else? It is that Great! Thanks guys!"
One Star <SEP> ok

One Star <SEP> didn't like the song
"The Indian Imprint of A UK Release <SEP> This is exactly the same album found on ARC records of the United Kingdom (distributed in the USA by Naxos) that is entitled ""Sufi Songs from India & Pakistan."" Reissued in 2010 with two indirectly related bonus tracks, this album by Shafqat Ali Khan is evidence that the Sham Chaurasi tradition of classical singing, going back 11 generations, is in good hands. Indeed, I find his voice more enjoyable than that of his father, the late Salamat Ali Khan. At age 12, Shafqat Ali Khan was given the title of ustad, master. Accompanied by tabla, harmonium, sarangi, and tanpura drone, the various Sufi songs and ragas (Bharvi, Piloo, Yaman Kalyan, Bhutyar) are powerfully performed. The recording is engineered bright with a sense of being in large open chamber. Listening intently to Khan's artistry in the thumri, the semi-classical form, and the serious pure raga style, I was struck by his control and crisp ornamentation. These are strong, emotional pieces yet meditative in effect. Afterwards, I seem to move as if in a dance. This is an excellent recording that may surprise even those unfamiliar with classical Indian vocal forms.

The first bonus track is a poem by Hafiz sung by Zohreh Jooya and an Irani ensemble; the second bonus, while also related to Sufism, is by the Glizar Turkish Music Ensemble. With these additions, the album is 79 minutes in duration."
Four Stars <SEP> I like it.
I really like it. Looking forward to new album featuring Mike ... <SEP> Just heard about this band and decided to give it a try.  I really like it.  Looking forward to new album featuring Mike Mills of R.E.M.
"Scam <SEP> This is a total scam by someone who never listened to a Victor Jara song, has no idea who he was, and doesn't even know what language he spoke. I hope nobody has fallen into this cheap piece of business like I almost did.

Songs by Victor Jara (Chilean folk singer, larger-than-life figure in the ""Nueva Cancion"" movement in Chile) appear mixed with songs by Brigada Victor Jara, a Portuguese folk group, singing Portuguese folk music, but with a name honouring Victor Jara. As such, songs 2 (Arriba Monte), 6 (Cantiga Bailada) and 25 (Ilha de Sons) are songs by Brigada Victor Jara, in Portuguese. So are songs 11 (O Cativo) and 21 (Vai-te Embora  Papao) in cd 2. So if you read this comment, do not buy this scam. Look for other albums by Victor Jara (and nobody else!), and feel free to look for Brigada Victor Jara as well, they also make great music ;)"
"Read story about this river catching on fire This moving ... <SEP> Read story about this river catching on fire
This moving song tells story from eyes on Native American , very special"
One Star <SEP> Only interested in the story of the Cuyahoga River told in the song.
Five Stars <SEP> It si a wonderfull Concert she is amazing Singer her voice is especial .
defective <SEP> It will only play in the amazon mp3 app. Ive tried dozens of times but it won't download to my music.
"Real Fresh Hip Hop, love it!! <SEP> Its a breath of fresh air to see artists like this in an industry saturated with so much crap like Lil Wayne or Kanye. If you love Real Hip Hop and appreciate some real lyrics and thought out content then you will love this album. Buy this!"
"Can't wait to see them live! <SEP> Are you a blues fan?  Like Janis Joplin?  Check out this band, they are gonna be big.  Hope they play WC Handy Fest this summer."
Five Stars <SEP> great classic blues rock/ pub rock
"Song is very elementary. <SEP> This is not the type of song I'd expect from a vet like Mariah Carey. First, it seems like Rick Ross and Meek Mill took over the song and she's just singing the hook. The production seems sloppy, her vocals are too high pitched at times for me, and even the video is horrible. I was hoping Mariah would quickly release a second single but it seems like she wants to ride this single until she debuts on American Idol..."
"Not A Victory <SEP> When it has came down to Mariah Carey, her music has really lost a lot of its edge. Not only in music, but also in the way she has brought out her drive. While she has a lot of joy, being a mother to twins, she honestly though has lost a lot with her feeling in driving in music. Her latest single, Triumphant (Get 'Em) with Rick Ross & Meek Mill is definitely not one of her best songs. It doesn't have the drive that she had in some of her past songs like It's Like That and Honey from Butterfly. I think Mariah might have it again with her music, hopefully it will thanks to her work on American Idol, but overall she really doesn't have it with the best in her music.

Song: D+"
"An Award for Musical Laziness....Mariah Has Triumphed <SEP> Mariah Carey is an artist of many ups and downs, vocally and personally. The last decade has seen her career turn to farce, somehow reconvene for a financially successful, if not musically mediocre period in Mariah's career. She was hit hard by the failure of ""Glitter"", it's soundtrack album, as well as her subsequent 2002 studio effort ""Charmbracelet"". She rebounded in 2005 with ""Emancipation"" and though she produced some memorable hits ""We Belong Together"" and ""Shake It Off"" being notable, I feel that vocally, Carey peaked sometime around 2000. I have always loved Mariah Carey, but as the years go on, I don't feel that she is bringing the same vocal efforts she used to. Her singing is much more breathy and whispery. It irritates me sometimes.

Post ""Emancipation.."" Carey released two more Studio albums and her 2nd christmas album. All of which were middle of the road efforts in terms of critical and commerical performance. My favorite song from this period would be her single ""Obsessed"" which became something of a surprise hit on radio stations across the country. In spite of this, over the years I went from being a diehard Mariah fan to pretty casual, as I have always felt that she could do much better things in music right now than she is doing.

""Triumphant (Get 'Em)"" has clear potential. A song about overcoming and looking towards brighter days. Who doesn't like that? The issue (for me anyways) is the fact that the whole act is getting a little played out. Mariah as a 21-st Century R&B Diva meets Ghetto diva is the same thing I have seen and heard on her last 3 albums. And the thing that makes this track even sadder is that at some points, she almost sounds like a guest on her own song. Rick Ross just kinda takes over in sections and it takes away from Mariah as well. Add in barely-there vocals and a lackluster, heard-it-before-ready-made hip hop beat circa 2007, it basically is a recipie for disaster. Her promotion of the single hasn't blown me away either. Her live performance of the song at Rockerfeller Center was terrible and very breathy. It was again all about Rick Ross. The studio version was better than the live, but not by much. Sometimes I just can't even understand what she is saying at all!!!!

The song has not done well on the charts. It peaked at 115 on Billboard (didnt make hot 100, slipped off after 3 weeks, and barely made it onto the r&b charts at 97, for a very brief stay as well.) The bad news is this single is pretty much critical and commercial toast. Hopefully she hasn't finished her album yet and maybe will retool and tinker with a few things. Or she may just release another obligatory disc of crap. After all, she is a new judge on American Idol, so she's gonna be paid either way. Happy listening!"
"Chill  Downtempo You get the picture. <SEP> I found the song  of the ""chill "" variety. I'm getting the whole album. May be a good gamble. How about you?"
One Star <SEP> 1 STAR THANKS
"back in the days! <SEP> I used to have a cassette of that album and it was very cool!
it was alson the last good album of the serie!"
"Lazarua A.D. <SEP> Damn...why have I not heard of these guys before 2013?!!! What thrash was, what it should be now, what thrash should aspire to be till the end of time!"
"Four Years Gone - It's Catchy <SEP> Four Years Gone is a tight and energetic punk/pop quartet from Ann Arbor, MI.  I've had the pleasure of playing three shows with them (twice with Circus of Soul- a could've been/should've been good cover band, and once with Tin Omen (when I was with them, a progressive/melodic metal band).  Their debut album, Shrink My World, is filled with catchy choruses, cool guitar riffs, and simple yet effective drumming.  The bass keeps the songs moving (courtesy of guitarist Conrad Agincourt III).  The best cuts here are: College Rock, After You, and Mattress (their demo, if you can find it, features rawer riffing and better solos, but that's just my opinion).  Eugene Norchester has a fine voice, with a good midrange sound that distinguishes himself from the whiny singers so common in this genre (think Blink-182 for annoying singing).  I know that this reference is dreaded by many, but if you like Green Day, you can consider this a fine debut."
Bay area gold <SEP> If you love Bay area aka Yay area rap then you will love Andre Nickatina kid. His lo-fi beats and machine gun rap style is legendary.
OUTSTANDING!!! <SEP> What else do you expect?  God has anointed Israel.  I pray he continues to minister in song and touch lives everywhere.
"Not too good <SEP> The song is only 1:23 long (I'm accustomed to reprise songs being longer than the radio edit).  Additionally, the volume is extremely low. I was sorely disappointed with this version.  However, the normal version is on point!"
best praise music <SEP> Love this song. Its a reminder that our lord and savior is still there. Thank you Jesus for saving me.
If I could rate  a zero it would be that! <SEP> I received this as a gift. The first one was a bad data transfer to disc and has a loud screech before some of the tracks. And a couple of the tracks has a play then delay than play feature. The first disc was replaced with a identical one.  I told the gift giver to get a complete refund. The big problem with this gift is that we have to play mouse and cat with Amazon. Amazon has raised their prices and lowered the quality of their products. BEWARE!
What Was That???? <SEP> The rules require that I must rate this product with at least ONE star. This screeching mess gave me a headache that has lasted four days! My flute playing wife hates it more than I do. That is 99 cents I'll never see again. Refund needed.
"Awesome album <SEP> Reminiscent of Kraftwerk, this album really Impressed me. Pfeifferhorn and Wasatch Waves are probably my favorite songs. I can't stop listening to it!"
"IM DREAMIN... THIS ISNT REAL!! <SEP> WARBELING, SCREACHING, IT IS NOT SINGING. IT SOUNDS LIKE A CAT IN A BLENDER......ON PUREE! THE ""ORIGINAL"" SONGS ARE REPETITIVE AND JUST PLAIN BORING, THE COVERS ARE TRITE AND OVER COVERED ALREADY, I MEAN DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER VERSION OF BLUE BAYOU?"
LOVE LOVE LOVE <SEP> Love this song!!
One Star <SEP> I did not get the complete song.
Mikey's Best <SEP> i met Mikey Dread a year before he passed away and he was a wonderful person...this final showdown of his music and style is a must to any person interested in culture and the spirit of Jamaican music...get to know Mikey Dread and you will be better for it!
"Great Version of a Great Gershwin Tune, and a GREAT voice. <SEP> You'll love it! Great for getting started in the morning. It'll put a spring in your step! Louise's voice is rich, womanly, sexy, smooth and lucious! Wonderful jazz ensemble too! A great version of this great Gershwin classic! You must hear this. This is a must-have. ""But oh-ho-ho! Whose got the last laugh now?!"""
Four Stars <SEP> A fantastic psych zone out album! Highly recommended.
"Kiss my ass <SEP> Love this song! Exactly how I feel at times,can not wait until she comes out with another hit! Stays on repeat"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"It's a gorgeous remake that almost sounds like a new song but still pays excellent homage to ... <SEP> As always the magnificent Anita delivers! She recreates ""Lately"" into her own style. It's a gorgeous remake that almost sounds like a new song but still pays excellent homage to the original version by Tyrese. I have both artist's versions and love both. Anita did an outstanding job and her signature style lushly delivers a masterpiece...once again."
"Fantastic Music - A Gem <SEP> Whether you are a recorder music fan or new to it Jim and Mindy's music is played from the soul and makes the heart sing.

Great mix of songs.

This is a one of a kind album that I recommend without reservation!

Listen for the unusual duo of the recorder and Q-Chord."
"wow <SEP> This song is so powerful! HE's not singing to put on a show ,he's singing from his heart and you can feel it all in your soul with this one! Can't say enough just AWESOME"
Great Spirirual Song <SEP> This song was moving and touch my heart and soul. It promotes prayer and people to walk right in the right path.
"Not the original recording <SEP> This is a LIVE recording, not the original single."
Not the original version <SEP> Listened to the first five seconds of this sample and this is obviously not the original recording.  I wish Amazon would start labeling rerecordings properly so people know what they're purchasing.
"i do not like this song ! <SEP> i usually like Rita Ora , But this song , JUST IS NOT A GOOD ONE !! i wish i didn't waiste my money on this song ."
"Love this song! <SEP> Loved this song, it was a must for me to have. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Drake is great in it"
"A classic <SEP> A classic. Not much to say, but Paul Simon's stylings are memorable."
Natalie is awesome! <SEP> I learned this as a little girl and love it till this day!
Good album. <SEP> Ended up buying album. Good album.
"I love nitty but her mixtape work is better <SEP> get it just for jumping clouds. She's a beast, so I got it to support her, but her mixtape stuff is CRAZY great. I feel this is a little watered down, but the jumping clouds beat will have you bringing it back so much you won't even hear the rest of the album. Love nitty, FYI due to a sacrificed phone I bought this album 2 times. She definitely is talented but many songs I already had (is this thing on, flower child, no standing here, auntie maria's crib....and you should definitely say that's a remix, because the OG auntie maria's crib was waaaay better). But I would say get it because the game is weak, especially with female artists, and this one comes strong."
Great Songs <SEP> Loved the Music
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent Music
"Firewater strikes again <SEP> Great album! The songs are strong, performances are fresh and the production is amazing. A must have for any fan or anyone with good taste in music."
One Star <SEP> i found it boring
Five Stars <SEP> wow
Wonderful album!!! <SEP> I first heard this album about 40 years ago. I loved it so I recorded it onto a cassette with a portable recorder. I kept making copies of it for years until about five years ago when I found an LP on Ebay!! I really wish I could find if on a CD. It is just beautiful!!!
Box of Change by Diane Patterson - thumbs up <SEP> Fantastic. I had a cassette demo of this from years ago... so happy it's in digital form and I could get it again. I love Diane Patterson and especially this song.
Outstanding <SEP> I love the message of this song! Toby has done it again! This song will become very popular-- maybe even his best song yet!
"Nothing short of a masterpiece! <SEP> This album is nothing short of a masterpiece. I don't think I really appreciated Andrew Peterson before I head this album. The first track really captures the pain and brokenness in this world, in a way, in which, so much of Christian music fails. It's an incredible mixture of sorrow and joy. A longing for a day when all will be restored."
Five Stars <SEP> Praise music doesn't get much better than Tobymac!
not very good. <SEP> I purchased this by mistake. The original version is great but this one not so great. Just too much remix. Kills it
mp3 <SEP> The music was fine but Im afraid Amazons policy of mp3 format and cloud player limits what you can use the download for. In order to download the music in wma you have to buy an entire CD. I would like to see single down loads in wma format as an option so they can be used in windows movie maker for instance. I see the internet has a program to convert mp3 to wma so others must be having the same problem.
Five Stars <SEP> ok
"this guy sounds like he's high <SEP> In my opinion, this guy sounds like he's high.  I could not understand most of the lyrics. It sounds like he's mumbling the words.  Even playing it on a high-end stereo did not help.  It is clear though, he is a left-wing activist.  But I bet that is in name only, because I never heard of him donating money tot the poor."
"wow, what a let down <SEP> used to like Ry a lot more before this crap - what a bore - 1 star for ruining music with left wing political blah blah - DO NOT BUY"
"'Psychedelic Underground 11' (Garden Of Delights)  Various Artists <SEP> About as good + has nearly as much to offer as other volumes of the 'Psychedelic Underground' CD series. Tracks that I able to acquire the most here were from Munich - a song by a band - Saffran,  ""Planet Of Dreamers"" from an obscure German band - Aigues Vives - named themselves after a French town, a so-so cut by Amon Duul II ""Flower Of The Orient"" off their 1976 'Pyragony X' lp, another off-the-radar obscure band Frob with ""Spheres"" and the quite likable ""Der Fremde"" by Eulenspygel. As like all the other volumes, a limited edition of 3,000 copies."
Breaking he's walls and it hurts so bad. <SEP> Im starting to think he's singing about him and another dude! Breaking he's walls and it hurts so bad.
"rip off <SEP> i guess i could have read more but its all there lady gaga, poker face. i assummed it was just that but no its a group called poker faces performing a song called poker face that is a tribute to lady gaga don't be fooled my son wanted the song i was on my way out the door so i ordered it on the run and once on the road found out it was the wrong song"
Five Stars <SEP> love this song
No need to purchase! <SEP> A Waste OF MONEY!
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
love this song <SEP> Me and my sis dance to this song all the time it a fun song and avuncular way to have a good time.
Five Stars <SEP> Now I can listen to the whole song while eating my cereal...
Two Stars <SEP> Only a so-so mix.
One Star <SEP> Too long.
Best album of the year  perfect <SEP> This is one of the best album of 2012..Slow Deep and very Dark ...a must buy ...take my word for it ..This Journey album...is like NIN.S With teeth ..and skinny puppy -ohgr album ..the Synth sounds or nice ..you can really Dance your ass Off ...or have a great workout ...to this album ....The best EBM .album of the year ...I just hope they come to the U.S and tour
"Best Album yet... <SEP> This is Maria's best album to date.............

This isn't the Justin Beiber version <SEP> If I could give it 0 stars I would because it's not the Justin Beiber version. They didn't need to redo it.
Not for kids as the title reflects <SEP> Bought this download cause I wanted a clean version for my 7 year old to listen to...the lyrics are the same as the original just performed by some other artist.  Very disappointed.
"Letdown. <SEP> This is perhaps the worst dollar I've ever spent. Mister Lies, love your music and everything you have produced thus far (Dionysian was cutting it), and therefore I feel that this release was just so so so short of being what I, and what I think  many people, expected.

Songs like I Walk & Safety Net are marvelous, nothing short of sonically spectral and hauntingly mesmerizing.

However, Waveny is in many ways undeserving of these adjectives. From the random beats in the beginning to the misplaced piano towards the middle of the song, I feel the best way to describe this would be ""banal beats.""

Sorry Mister Lies, here's to hoping your full length is better than this disappointment."
And the worst part is the fact that this is a non-refundable ... <SEP> Do not purchase this version of the song. The song has been edited to where at least 30-40 seconds of the song are missing. Parts of a verse were cut out. I was genuinely pissed off. And the worst part is the fact that this is a non-refundable purchase. Very disappointed that they would actually take content out for NO REASON whatsoever.
Dolphy's Masterpiece <SEP> This is one of the greatest jazz compositions and performances I have ever heard. It ranks with the best of Mingus. I first heard it when I was 8 years old (my musician uncle introduced it to me) and it has stuck in my mind ever since. It is a shame that it is not easily available for download.
Five Stars <SEP> I am praising God
remembering <SEP> I just love this song ...heard on sirus the other day for the first time in I don't know how long...
"Another favorite! <SEP> This song is older than me but is still very much enjoyed and appreciated. The song is poetic, romantic, and passionate."
For cumbia lovers <SEP> It's ok.
This is a good Norteno Song <SEP> I normally do not listen to Norteno music. But this CD is good. I would recommend it to all my friend's that like Norteno music.
Five Stars <SEP> Great big band jazz with an intimate sounding manner. Shew is excellent and band scores well written.
"Variations within a mix <SEP> Continual expermentation has long been the hallmark of  Einstrzende Neubauten and they continue with their new band entirely released album,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alles-Weider-Offen/dp/B000W4HFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alles Weider Offen</a>&nbsp;and with Weil Weil Weil their first single EP download. This single includes the band members remixing the original sound tracks and achieving remarkably varied results.
I give the music itself five stars but wish I could get it without compression to mp3. EN are peerless craftsmen of sound and mp3 compression with its inevitable narrowing of range of dynamics is regrettable with their music."
"Not What I Expected <SEP> While this music might be essential listening for the first season viewer of Wallander I was expecting the excellent music that, apparently, was produced for the second season. I should have looked more closely before spending $24 for this. The music itself is heavy, uninspired, and devoid of positive energy. I will continue to look for the second season music but won't be lisgtening to this much."
"Incorrect Track List listed (NO BABY) <SEP> The track list is incorrect. ""Baby"" is not on the album but is listed. I've had the CD since it came out, bought the vinyl for a straight vinyl DJ set, wanted that song. Too bad for me I guess. It's a great album without it, one star for basically misleading folks."
One Star <SEP> Bought the vinyl for Baby and it's the only song missing.
"Missing ""Baby"" but lists that as a track on the vinyl when you go to purchase <SEP> I ordered this as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband. It arrived and Baby is missing from the album. That is the ONLY reason I purchased b/c I wanted to have our first dance on vinyl. So frustrated...they have this list of tracks under the vinyl album for sale. VERY MISLEADING.

"poo <SEP> Whoa Whoa whoa why is the song ""baby"" not on here?! Only reason I bought it. :-["
Music Evaluation <SEP> I studied music in my youth.  These guys are very innovative. The more I listen the more I appreciate their efforts.
Horrible waste of vinyl <SEP> I have a very open mind when it comes to music. I love it all. Except for this. It is garbage. Plain and simple.
"Two Stars <SEP> I liked it at first, but now it one of those songs I just fast forward through."
Very Disappointed <SEP> A lot of money to pay for sweet bird sounds along with car and plane sounds.  Not very peaceful with the car and plane noises. I get those sounds for free at my home.  I think the seller should either redue the recording or state what it actually is.  You don't hear that in the small sample.
"Best version of this song out there <SEP> Best version of this song.  Sung by some up and coming YouTube artists you've probably never heard of.  Very well done and nicely produced.  Keep track of these names, you will be hearing more from them."
great song <SEP> I just love this song and I am able to move it from my Amazon music player to my other music player in my phone which us nice since that is what I usually use.
"Song to workout too <SEP> enjoy the show, these kid are great dancer, and will be miss when the show ends this month. GREAT Song!"
I ended up buying the disk <SEP> an upbeat song my daughters loves I ended up getting her the CD for the car. Since she would only want to hear two songs. Since Thats was all I had
Do yourself a favor and DON'T read or listen to this book! <SEP> If I could add no stars I would. Her voice is worse than nails on a chalkboard and I couldn't get through more than one chapter of it. The story is stupid as hell and at the end she says it's fiction lol so it's not a true story? And she tears 'daddy Derek' apart. I hope Sophia never reads this. What a messed up family. They do not deserve the spotlight or this book or audio book. Yikes.
Teen Trash <SEP> Most dumbest retarded studio trashy artist I've ever heard she doesn't care about her daughter just a bad  mom who's struggling  like a cat with down syndrome.
... think we're hating on her but OMG this really sucks she can't sing or even be a good parent ... <SEP> Ok we all know Farrah is going to think we're hating on her but OMG this really sucks she can't sing or even be a good parent to her child I'm sorry I did think about buying this for my daughter but I'm good I do not want to hear this crap in my house well Farrah you seem to like port maybe you should do that cause you definitely can't frinking sing
"Oy. <SEP> If I recorded the sound my dog makes when he passes wind and added Auto Tune, I hazard it would sound better.

It surpasses all logic that someone would package this and sell it as music. Farrah should stick to what she does well - yelling at her mother and marketing sex toys."
One Star <SEP> S*** sandwich
"The beat wasn't too bad and then <SEP> Where to begin....

I actually decided to listen to the entire album (Mainly because I was taking muscle relaxers and pain killers). I'm not sure what she was going for but here's my breakdown by track ....

1. Blowin': It had some promise. The beat wasn't too bad and then... she started singing and the music no longer covered up the vocals.
2. Finally Getting Up From Rock Bottom: The beat again, wasn't that bad and then... she started singing... with autotune. Oh the humanity. I think she was mentioning sitting in traffic on the highway. I normally don't condone doing such things but if she feels so inclined...
3. The Sunshine State: She opened up with her autotune. I'm not sure what she was saying. I think I heard ""Short"". Yeah, I don't know what to tell ya. At this point I must puke because it's just bad....
.... alright I'm back.
4. Unplanned Parenthood: She opens up saying ""Oh baby, Oh baby"" in autotune. I'm pretty sure that she's autotunning about parenthood and being by herself a single parent (although seriously... she doesn't have it that rough) poor thing is having to change diapers (I caught that much in the song).
5. Searching for Closure: Surely this isn't too bad. It starts off with some rain and piano. Yes, a glimmer of hope. It's not too bad.... uh oh.. here comes the autotune talking.. not even singing. *Face/palm*
6. Caught in the Act: Oh really really bad autotune and oh.. oh is that dubstep... yes. And now some REALLY bad autotune. I think she should be more worried about being caught in stupidity.
7. The Phone Call That Changed My Life: It starts off with ""You can only put so much in a song"". Yes and what you decided to put in every song is autotune. Have I said how much it sucks? Yeah this song sucks too.
8. With Out This Ring: Again, starting with Autotune... talking. The beats not entirely bad though.
9. After Prom: So this gem starts off w/ ""shhh don't tell don't let it get out"". Not sure what she doesn't want getting out. It should have been this album.
10. Liar Liar: ... aaaaand more autotune with the same words she says over and over again. What she's saying... I don't know.
11. On My Own: bla bla bla autotune bla bla music sucks bla

So the long short of it is.. this album sucks big time. Like a super drunk Paris Hilton who got ahold of the autotune app on her phone and decided to go to town on a severely offbeat rant about her ""struggles"" in life... such is this album. Those who decide to take a peek at this be warned you can never recover. The black soul sucking hole is real...."
"This is coming from someone who purchased ""don't be tardy for the party"" and liked it <SEP> I read all the reviews and thought ""it can't be that bad"" and then I listened to the samples and was like ""it is that bad!!"". If I'm going to ignore the auto tune here for a second... She's not even singing. She's talking. And not in a rhythm that goes with the music. It's definitely worth listening to the samples, because there is nothing like it out there to compare it to."
"The worst thing i've ever heard. <SEP> This has to be the worst thing i've ever heard. All of her songs are horrible!!! Seriously think there is blood coming from my ears. She can NOT sing and her voice sucks so they try to cover it up with auto tune. She's just trying to use her ""fame"" to make as much money as possible. She's covering all her bases porn, tv shows, music, books, etc. She needs to just stop already."
"The delusions of a public LOSER! Don't buy the book! <SEP> Do NOT buy this book!! It's a waste of time and money!!  It becomes quite obvious right from the get-go that Farrah hasn't seen much in the way of an English class....ummmm.....ever?  Her idiotic, delusional opinions of people and the way life ""should"" be are similar to what I would have expected to read from the journal of a 13-year-old, frustrated teen who just stared her PERIOD (hormonal!).  If only Farrah could have a single introspective second within her pathetic little life, she may just realize that she really doesn't have all the answers that she's fooled herself for having!  THIS is what happens when you take a relatively head-strong girl from a po-donk little town in Idaho....and you tell her she's ""smart""!  This book should really be entitled:  "" I Was Just Another Pregnant High School Teenager Who Thought She Knew-It-All Until She Really Screwed Things Up""!!!!  Lets not ""encourage"" this one any further....I'm tired of seeing her mug!!!"
"Makes me sad to be an American <SEP> This is awful and the fact that it has even been released is a slap in the face of the human race. I know people are still sensitive to the issue, but I wonder if it's too late for Farrah Abraham to be aborted."
5 Stars <SEP> I love this song.
garbage <SEP> She'd better stick to reality tv because this is trash. Over synthesized reminds me of akon or some shit. just awful.. I love farrah but hate this!
Love Teto <SEP> Amazing. Utau is better than vocaloid. Teto is the best by far. Buy this now! You will not regret it
"Incomparably beautiful! <SEP> Exquisite music for meditation, yoga and stilling the mind - unique in its ability to takes the listener to a deep inner place. I listen to it every day."
"Fantastic recording. Perfect meditative sitar music without drums (tabla) ... <SEP> I loved this recording. Perfect meditative sitar music (at points) with minimal drums (tabla) - ideal for deep meditation. Evokes the magic and mystery of spiritual India as very few other recordings do.

When meditating, I don't care for sitar music that speeds up and goes into a lot of drums it disturbs the peaceful vibe, but it's nearly impossible to find. This recording does have songs that speed up and get pretty busy, but there are a lot of minutes of decent slow peaceful contemplative sitar here that can be edited into a usable CD for meditation.

Not technically perfect, there is some very slight microphone rustling here and there, a few stray noises - not really noticeable to the non-audiophile, but with headphones on you can hear a few things here and there - but the composition and the performance more than make up for it. Glenn Sharp brings out the wonder and beauty of this ancient and spiritual instrument with divine grace.

I'd like to hear more mystical recordings without continuous chicari (high string strum at top of each phrase) [ching!] and no tabla - but have not found it yet. Still looking - if anyone out there has found any sitar music like that please respond here."
Five Stars <SEP> A superior live album.
Good ol 'Chris <SEP> So very Chris Vrenna original. Unique drum (machine) based songs. Great for listening in he car with high volume. Happy to have this CD in my collection
"This is an excellent album <SEP> Chris Vrenna delivered a masterpiece.  I love call the time eternity it perfectly mixed elements of TATATU and 2 a.m. wakeup call.  I also love the continued element of female vocals that ctte used with Scarling's Jessicka Addams and Collide's Karin.  Chris has described the album as an experiment of manicness and I think he captured the abrupt ups and downs perfectly.  The album is dark, brooding, and foreboding.  It combines classic industrial drum sounds Vrenna helped make famous with updated electronics and new elements that gives tweaker new life.  Simply put I love this album and think its a perfect addition to my collection for late night soundtracking."
"Classey Gospel with Spirit <SEP> BEAUTIFUL RENDITION, Elder McLendon, I could hear the words in my soul as the music strolled on.  Thanks for sharing your God Given Gift of Instrumental Gospel.  God's Love continue in Your Life, Rosie"
Two Stars <SEP> live version & doesn't have his woman counterpart
Favorite Record <SEP> The record arrived in almost perfect condition! It is my current favorite of my collection! The print sounds amazing and who could go wrong with Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong??
Munsters - Surf Rock Style <SEP> Great cover of the TV classic. The Surf Dawgs do a fun job of capturing that sixties surf-scene vibe without messing with the original theme too much. Recommended !
"Beautiful, hypnotic ballad from this instrumental celtic group from Cape Breton <SEP> This song captures the beauty of Cape Breton like no other.  I was fortunate to see them perform this song live at this year's Celtic Colours festival.  A great bunch of guys with plenty of talent."
sounds like geddy lee <SEP> Singer has a large hint of rush singer Geddy Lee
"Best prog going <SEP> Prog rock played the way it was meant to be. Would love to see them in concert. ELP, Yes, Genesis,and all other prog bands have nothing on this band. I can't wait to get more of there albums. Beneath The Veil Of Winter Face is my favorite. Delusion Rain next then this one."
read alongs are great <SEP> I am glad to have this record for my kids for them to listen to at their Greatgrandparents. I had the special edition of this record with his picture on the cover. My Empire Strikes Back record was a similar format. The storybooks went along with the record closer and I could read along... Partially how I learned to read before Kindergarten
What happened to the new anita baker CD <SEP> I have been waiting but no news and no new CD. I don't know what happened. I can't find anything on the web either.
I enjoyed the movie and related the scenes in the movie ... <SEP> I enjoyed the movie and related the scenes in the movie with the musical score ... Rather emotional at times ...
"Great Song... <SEP> Nice beat,good dance song,Keke has a great voice...very nice song. BTW the lead guy in the video is great eye candy!"
One Star <SEP> Joky tripe
Ehhhh <SEP> The record was warped. I love the music kinda still sad about the whole thing. Thanks for asking
CUZ  is Comedy with GREAT music!! <SEP> CUZ is a blend of country/country rock/southern rock/rock n roll and is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time.  A must have for your collection!!
crowdfunding platform edition? <SEP> Is this the crowdfunding platform edition Quran I'm looking for?
"Rather Dull <SEP> I know I am in the minority here, but after at least a dozen listens, I found nothing compelling about this album at all.  Kragen Lum's work in Heathen is what drew me here but there is nothing that matched the intensity or the melodic guitar work of Evolution of Chaos, my #1 album of 2010.
I cannot really place my finger (or ear) on the problem, it just seems the riffs are very much samey sounding song after song, they rarely change pace in any of the songs & the vocals come off as flat, uninspiring.  A few leads here & there sounded good but that doesn't make an entire album.  After laying this one down for almost 6 months perhaps I'll give it another try to see if my opinion changes, but that is rarely the case."
"Disappointing to say the least <SEP> After their mediocre previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Global-Drama/dp/B001BG2Y0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Global Drama</a>, three of the five members of Cloudscape left the band. Needless to say, I was worried their 'new era' would fall short off the mark. I've always considered their second album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimson-Skies/dp/B000FVHGU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimson Skies</a>, their best: it beautifully merged the band's melodic metal sensibilities with subtle progressive overtones without slipping into cheesiness.

New Era sees vocalist Mike Andersson and guitarist Patrik Svard shedding their formidable songwriting vision that was marked by highly nuanced, complex arrangements and hook-laden vocals in favour of simpler and shorter tunes. There is a distinct effort to write catchier and more accessible tunes with a very modern slant to it. The song ""Share Your Energy"" even boasts some metalcore type of backing vocals which actually detract from the composition rather than contribute to it. ""Kingdom of Sand"" consists of industrial sound effects with awful pop vocals and watery guitar leads. The guitars no longer cut through the mix as they used to; the riffs are puny and lifeless. Vocals are delivered in a very direct manner, gone are the piercing screams balanced by clean and throaty vocal passages. Andersson actually sounds like he delivers the verses in a boring monotone. The choruses that defined this band's sound are gone, and the instrumental parts sound terribly weak, especially the guitar leads. When the vocals do hit centre-stage on songs like ""Seen It All Before"" or ""Your Desire,"" they sound so different not even a die-hard fan would know it's the same band that wrote and released their prior work. The only song that resembles their earlier body of work is ""Voyager 9."" It sounds like a leftover from their earlier sessions due to its blend of fiery lead work with powerful vocals and complex arrangements.

Think of this album much like Evergrey's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monday-Morning-Apocalypse/dp/B000ELL7K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monday Morning Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;and you should be able to imagine how much of a departure it is from their core sound. I'm all for progression and growth, but once the 'new era' of a band severs all ties with their core identity (blending industrial sounds with so-called aggressive vocals buried under plodding drum and bass with almost inaudible guitar work -- all within painfully predictable song structures), chances are the band is now aiming at a different audience, which seems to be exactly the case here."
Five Stars <SEP> Nicholas is a great player and I love his sound and Groove!!!
"THE HERALD <SEP> DISAPPOINTINGLY PEDESTRIAN ALBUM. THE BACKING MUSICIANS AND THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GOOD BUT MANY OF THE TUNES CHOSEN ARE NOT MELODIC, AND SO NO AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION AND ARRANGING WILL MAKE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT BORING.

WITH THE PUBLICITY ABOUT MHAIRI HALL BEING A FORMER PUPIL OF THE GREAT CELTIC PIANIST, MICHEAL O'SUILLEBHAIN, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. BUT I HATE TO SAY IT, THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF THE PUPIL HAVING LEARNT VERY LITTLE FROM THE MASTER. THE HYPE MAKES IT ALL SO DISAPPOINTING. SOME TRACKS ON THE ALBUM ARE OK BUT THE PIANO-PLAYING IS VERY ORDINARY THROUGHOUT AND NOT THE LEAST BIT INNOVATIVE OR GROUND-BREAKING.

THERE HAS BEEN A CROP OF ALBUMS OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC ON PIANO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS LIKE THE ONES BY ANDY THORBURN, MARY McCARTHY, PHAMIE GOW, SANDY MELDRUM AND JAMES ROSS. MHAIRI HALL'S ALBUM IS BETTER THAN THE POOR QUALITY OF ANDY THORBURN'S AND MARY McCARTHY'S BUT I'M AFRAID THE THREE OF THEM SHOULD HAVE SAVED THEIR SOLO-PIANO COSTS AND STUCK TO THEIR USUAL PIANO-ACCOMPANIMENT ROLES. THE TWO BEST TRADITIONAL PIANO ALBUMS ARE THOSE BY JAMES ROSS AND SANDY MELDRUM---BOTH WELL PRODUCED WITH QUALITY PIANO PLAYING, BUT FOR ME SANDY MELDRUM'S ACCLAIMED ALBUM IS STILL HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THEM ALL FOR INNOVATION AND MUSICIANSHIP. A PITY ABOUT MHAIRI'S DEBUT ALBUM BEING SO DISAPPOINTING."
"Magnificent! <SEP> I received my ""Finding Happiness"" CD about six days ago.  After ten or more spins the teachings are really hitting home for me.  Ryotoshi Norcross is an extremely gifted teacher and speaker.  I have already changed a few small things in my life directly because of this CD.  I think it is brilliant and I am far more happy now!

"One Star <SEP> recored to low,"
""" A great disappointment! <SEP> Sound quality and content both ""suck.""
A great disappointment!!!"
"Decent pressing and totally true to the original 1959 release <SEP> Before proceeding I want to disclose that I play this on a relatively cheap turntable connected to a computer via USB. That means that the signal I hear is digital even though it's coming from a vinyl platter. Still the sound quality is excellent and I can only imagine how it would sound on a proper, analog system.

Since there is no track list nor sound samples on this page at the time of this review I will provide them. Here are the tracks:
SIDE A
A1  Nina Simone: He's Got The Whole World In His Hands
A2  Chris Connor: Cottage For Sale
A3  Carmen McRae: Old Devil Moon
A4  Nina Simone: I Loves You, Porgy
A5  Chris Connor: Try A Little Tendernes
A6  Carmen McRae: You Made Me Care
SIDE B
B1  Nina Simone: For All We Know
B2  Chris Connor: What Is There To Say
B3  Carmen McRae: Too Much In Love To Care
B4  Nina Simone: African Mailman
B5  Chris Connor: Good Bye
B6  Carmen McRae: Last Time For Love
You can listen to most (but not all) of the sound samples on this page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nina-Simone-and-Her-Friends/dp/B00AMCUTRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nina Simone and Her Friends</a>.

The music on this album speaks for itself and I personally am happy to have what amounts to a compilation of three great vocalists. Nina's piano work is an added bonus. Listen to the sound samples and decide for yourself.

All of Nina's tracks were from the December 1957 session that produced her debut album titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Girl-Blue-Remastered/dp/B00E7NIT5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Girl Blue (Remastered)</a>. In fact some tracks from that album are repeated on this one. She is backed on the tracks on this album by Jimmy Bond on bass and Al 'Tootie' Heath on drums.

Carmen McRae's tracks were all recorded in NYC on October 6, 1954. She is backed by an ensemble comprised of Herbie Mann on flute and tenor sax, Mat Mathews on accordion, Mundell Lowe on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.

For Chris Connor the tracks were recorded in separate sessions in August 1954. Try a little tenderness and What is There to Say were recorded in NYC on August 9 and 11, 1954 featuring Connor backed by a drummerless trio comprised of Ellis Larkins on piano, Everett Barksdale on guitar and Beverly Peer on bass. The other two tracks by Connor were recorded in NYC on August 21, 1954 and feature Connor backed by Ronnie Odrich on flute and clarinet, Don Burns on accordion, Joe Cinderella on guitar, Vinnie Burke on bass and Art Mardigan on drums.

I think the highlight is Nina Simone, but I also love Carmen Mcrae's tracks. In fact I love all three. this is more of a compilation of Bethlehem's top female vocal talent in the 1950s, although it was released after Nina had left the label on not so good terms. But that is another story and has nothing to do with the wonderful music on this album."
"Didn't hold my interest <SEP> This relaxation recording was so repetitive, and done in such a monotonous voice, that I couldn't sit still and listen to it.  It was ""bring your awareness to your ________ - feel your ________ relax"" over and over and over again, to the point of real annoyance!  There are many good relaxation exercises out there on Amazon - give this one a pass."
Love it!!! <SEP> Amazing song! Love this song!! Brings back great memories.  Love that I download to my AmazonCloud and can play on my Driod as well as my computer :)
"Five Stars <SEP> It's the Cranberries, nuff said!"
Five Stars <SEP> Another hit on my list love this song
Marcha Nupcial <SEP> Purchased this music for  a wedding. worked out very well. It was more traditional than others and was perfect for our wedding.
Disappointing <SEP> These were not the original songs by the original artists. Which is what made first release from Jive bunny so great.
"Let it be said of us <SEP> I love this song. Great Vocals, Great Lyrics, Great Melody.
I love Casting Crowns. John Waller and Mark Hall do a Great Job with song.
A Must Have For Christian Music Fans."
LOVE IT! <SEP> Another John Mayer GREAT! This is John with his band and it's awesome! These guys make some fantastic music together. I just can't wait until they put out another CD - hope it's soon!
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
Five Stars <SEP> Old school underground house music can always get just about anyone on their feet.  Classic!
One Star <SEP> Stupid. I wish he would shut up.
Gloria! <SEP> This an excellent choral piece.  The first movement is very exciting and I love it! 10/10 would recommend listening to this whole work. John Rutter is fabulous!
Beautiful song! <SEP> Beautiful song! I could play this song over and over without ever tiring of it.
"BOW WOW Should put TIEC TOCC ON THIS <SEP> IT""S OK BUT BOW WOW IS SOOO BORING IM SORRY
AMAZON HAS ALOT OF FRESH NEW TALENT LIKE KERI HILSON>> AND TIEC TOCC's NEw SInGLE "" FROZEN"" ANd Computer Love"
"Ray J should leave the singing to Jeremih and Tiec Tocc <SEP> Ray J Is not the same I think  Brandy should give him a ear full

he should leave the singing to new stars like Jeremih  Birthday sex and Tiec Tocc ,Frozen
even Kid Cudi Day and Nite
Im glad some of these artist want something new"
"TIec Tocc song Frozen is love and Ray J is wack <SEP> I love how you can find new talent on amazon and spread the word Ray j is trying to hard to sing notes he cant

"be original <SEP> This Is Hot I mGlad Amazon supports Artist
I Also Bought Tiec Tocc's new song "" Frozen"" On amazon
and he is  refreshing
He is controversy lol"
"Disappointing <SEP> I am a huge fan of both, Beto and LODVG, but this track is a huge let down. It's repetitive, lacks harmony tension, dynamics, and comes across as a track from an amateur musician and producer.

With this said, the song is very different when performed live. If you look on YouTube you can see a bit more emotion and complexity, but this studio version sounds stale, amateur, unoriginal, monotonous, boring, and poor in terms of musical talent."
"A wonderful group on the pinnacle of success. <SEP> These four young people ..all 17 years old and in high school in Saint Paul, Mn just blew me away with the music. I didn't know a thing until they did MNL on Saint Cloud State's University TV. I was so impressed by each and every one of these talented musicians that I had to go buy their CD's and see where they were headed.  All I can say is see them as soon as you can because they are all going to be ultra-famous very soon."
"Giltch in the song. <SEP> Love the song... BUT FAULTY DOWNLOAD. @4:38 the song has a glitch and has an noticeable popping sound in the track. I've tried downloading the song twice, but the same problem. Amazon please get this corrected. It isn't very ethical to sell a faulty track. I hope they move on this."
Five Stars <SEP> Ruth Fazel has a divine calling as a musician and it can be heard through her music
"It was annoying <SEP> It was annoying sounds. Thought it might help me relax,but i kind of got on my nerves. It was irritating."
"This is orchestra music, nothing more <SEP> I like Hybrid.  I don't really listen to  orchestral music.  This isn't anything like hybrid techno music.  It is just orchestra music with no resemblance to Hybrid.  Don't know what I was expecting, but probably will never listen to it again."
From Cinderella Liberty? <SEP> Love the album cover!
A must song to have <SEP> Great singer!
"I bought this in ERROR <SEP> The Commitments is a great sound track and THIS IS NOT!!!!! I rushed the gun on ordeing and got this by mistake. The cover band just can't pull off the vocals of the original Commitments. I am extremely disapointed. I just purchased ""The Commitments"" Deluxe and thats the STUFF!!!!!!!"
"Sad to say, I'll not go the Volume 1 way... <SEP> Although there is absolutely nothing wrong with the performances on this cd, they are covered in so many of my other collections, and not worth it to me to invest the price of the Beethoven Big Box (180 selections!) in a 10-song volume."
Great song! <SEP> Great song!
Five Stars <SEP> I'm different
Delete this from Amazon <SEP> Garbage!
This is arguably the best of the classic recordings of Messiah <SEP> This is arguably the best of the classic recordings of Messiah. It has the full orchestral sound of the Mozart-Sargent embellishments to Handel's original score
Worst noise ever <SEP> Absolutely terrible!
"What A Hidden Gem!!!!  A Must Have... <SEP> If you love jazz fusion, this is one of the best selection of cuts you will ever hear.  I found this group via my Marcus Miller Radio on Pandora and they are slammin'.  Wonk is dialed into the off beat, syncopated rhythms that each  cut delivers authentic, original melodies that are far more artisitc and fulfilling than the standard, cookie-cutter music on the radio today.  All you have to do is listen to the staccato run in 'Bread N Butter' and you will know what I mean......what a gem!!!  A must have for any true fan of jazz music!!!!"
Chill song' <SEP> awesome song perfect for he late night rides goodie!
sigh <SEP> Trash. I only downloaded it for a bday party I was dj'ng for in addition to a few other songs.
"You in 1st Place! <SEP> This song is SO much better than the radio edit. I smile every time I hear it. Oddly, it's also an excellent running song."
"Sizing <SEP> I ordered an XL and an XXL...neither tee shirt was realistic, size-wise  I could not give the XXL as a gift,as it was too small.  The XL was more like a medium, and the XXL more like a slightly roomy large."
"Not a true DSD recording Buyers Beware <SEP> I paid almost as much for this recording as for Warners Leonid Kogan box set which contains the same performance  Using audiophile headphones ( Audio Teknica AT 5000 ""Rafetto""') i detected only a marginal increase in warmth in the Japanese disc  Moreover virtually all the annotation is in Japanese. Parusing the disc cover led me to believe I was paying a premium price for an SACD but neither my Oppo nor Onkyo players indicated the presence of a digital recording  Any potential buyer is better served purchasing the excellent Warner Kogan box set for nearly the same price"
"Good tunes but not a chronology of the best from D1. <SEP> If your looking for the epic tunes from D1 then this is NOT it.  Really disappointing.  Really, it is.  Really."
"Terrible <SEP> If I could give it 0 stars I would.. this is terrible. It's a disgrace to the King of Pop. DO NOT BUY.
Not that I think anyone is going to buy this."
Great Music to sing and dance to! <SEP> A great album that's a lot of fun!  We were lucky to catch these guys at a couple of local shows and my son loves them!  This album was played so many times it actually began to skip.
"An excellent song to work out to! <SEP> Heard it the firrst on ""Zumba Fitness!"" and I have to say it was catchy! It helps me to stay focused when I am running on the treadmill; which reminds me I can't wait to buy the nre Zumba game soon!"
"Excellent Second Album <SEP> Scorpion vs Tarantula is an excellent, very active group in Phoenix. This album has a bunch of great songs. If forced to choose favorites, Doin' It Wrong, Snake Coiled Up Inside His Heart, and Dance Donia would be my top three picks. There is a significant body of YouTube video of their concerts."
"By far the worse thing she ever produced. <SEP> As along time admirer and follower, this reeks of some of the drug-induced 1980's ""noise"" that they called music. I get it - disco bandwagon, but a tad late - disco was passe by1985, so why the diversion? I am reminded by two of her previously recorded songs (one synthesized here) that lead one to think something is ""off"" during this non-creative period: APATHY (I can't sleep, I can't write I can't eat, I can't fight,this damned old apathy is killing me) and ABUSE (the pretty lies you tell me , keep me missing the sad parts) that perhaps the creative flow of her unique artistry, clashing with an overindulgent producer-for-life, were taking their toll (not to mentioned involving some other types of ""abuse""). I know there will be die-hard fans to disagree with me (""it's not that bad"") - they think everything this poetess does is gold - but c'mon, can you really agree that this electronic tinny percussion-driven album is enjoyable to listen to?

The only thing worth exploring (and maybe allows some forgiveness for this mess of an album) are the 2 songs here (Every Breath, Love Somebody) that were done in her original singer-songwriter style on the previously recorded LP Seventh Wave, and the original version of Apathy (the b-side to the one-off 1981 Epic single ""One More Try""). Good news is that Melanie got out of this brief ""funk"" and produced in the later 1980s and early 1990s some excellent and mature work that still stands time. Forget this album - seek others that have real merit."
One Star <SEP> accidentally ordered
awesome songs <SEP> My way of prayer is through singing and buying this has helped me a lot to get more closer to God.
"GOOD SONG, WRONG SINGER <SEP> GOOD SONG , WRONG SINGER!  my bad!  sorry"
"is it any wonder why you fall in love with this girl <SEP> Listen, is it any wonder why you fall in love with this girl?"
"Sounds like a demo tape <SEP> This ""album"" sounds more like a demo tape or a tape someone is using to see what tracks to use for a finished product than a finished project itself. I was a bit disappointed.  The voice is decent, the selections not so much."
Great <SEP> She is such a talent. Great performer and singer of many different types of music. Love her and her presentations and more.
Five Stars <SEP> DOPE! ALBUM
Ok for teens. <SEP> Ok for teens. Lots of crooning. Not what I expected but clean lyrics.
"Please order the album! A gift to your ears <SEP> This is another masterpiece that Dwele has blessed our ears to!!! Omg from the intro to the Last Song is absolutely perfect.. He never disappoints me, it is worth ordering for those whom are Dwele fans!!"
Amazing! <SEP> This is an amazing song! One of my top 5 favorite songs from a musical! I highly recommend for anyone who loves the theater!
"Love the Soundtrack <SEP> Assassin's Creed is one of my all time favorite RPG games. I love the series and really love the soundtrack, it was an amazing download. If you like video game soundtracks, then this is a must-have. City of Rome is my favorite track. Really gets reminiscing about when i first bought the game"
Or ill run you down too! <SEP> Words can't describe how this song made me feel.....
"Ripoff <SEP> What I was looking for was a recording of Carol Burnett's theme song - performed by Carol Burnett herself.  Apparently, such a recording is not available for purchase, so I purchased this recording for $1.00.  I should have seen that the recording is only 46 seconds long.  The recording is of only the FIRST verse!  What a ripoff!"
"""Dawn"" of the dead is more like it <SEP> This was without a doubt the most dreadful album I have ever heard.  Holy moly each song was about as boring as the previous one.  I realize the world can only produce one Gordon Lightfoot singer songwriter, but these songs were all downers.  Consider finding and playing some samples before you purchase, wish I did.  UPDATE: As of this update there now appears to be mp3 offerings of the songs, which provides 30sec samples of each track....strongly encourage listening to the samples before  purchase!"
"This vinyl disc is not good at all <SEP> I would NOT recommend anybody to buy this vinyl record. NOT because of the songs, the lush orchestration, or the world renown Spanish artist himself, but because of the quality of the vinyl record itself. The sound is muffled, weak, and suppressed. It does not reveal the splendor of these wonderful songs. UA Latino did an awful job with the distribution of this particular record and another one titled ""El Golfo"". (But I do give the company credit with the other records of Raphael in which it did a stupendous job in its quality and press.) You will do well in obtaining the SAME album distributed by another lable, like CBS International, Allied Parnaso (available only in high fidelity), Capital Mexico, Gamma or EMI Mexico, or some other foreign label. How I know about this record? I'm an avid collector of Raphael's recordings. I had this particular vinyl record. I was of course extremely disappointed with it. And you will be, too."
Thank you! <SEP> I can purchase a rare CD at a reasonable price and am satisfied. It is a very good sound. Thank you!
"Meh <SEP> This album falls short compared their others. If you're collecting the Mono albums like me, save this one for last."
"Mono-dimensional <SEP> As someone who owns all of the Mono releases since their debut Under the Pipal Tree including live, compilation and splits, I can honestly sat that For my Parents is by far the weakest Mono release yet.  This does not mean that it is bad per say but it simply does not measure up to previous albums.  The Worldless Orchestra was great in the live setting, but here in the studio, the strings actually detract from the music.  Unlike most of their releases, there is no real fluctuation in mood.  On most albums there is an ebb and flow from pastoral beauty to massive aggression and back again, kind of like a prog rock Pixies.  For My Parents really has just one mood, soft & mellow minimalism.  And on the vinyl release was it really necessary for a double album?  Two sides are shorter than 10 minutes a piece.  I'll keep the album for completeness, but it is a very disapointing show from the generally fantastic Mono."
"They didn't edit out mistakes! <SEP> I was listening to the samples and found on #17, ""We Gather Together,"" that he made a mistake, stopped, went back and played it correctly--but they didn't edit it out. Not buying this one!"
"No Lyrics <SEP> When I see the words ""hymns"" in a title I expect to hear lyrics...guess I am wrong. The music is nice sounding and relaxing and my review of 2 stars is because their are no lyrics. I feel the title is a bit misleading."
"Oh no, not an album of covers! <SEP> Please tell me you're not about to release a whole album of faithful covers, Mayer.  You're brilliant when you create new music in the style of 70s classic soul, but do we really need another ""karaoke"" album on the market?  I really hope this is the only cover version on the album..."
"Not relaxing or soothing at all. <SEP> Tried the sample before buying and decided not to buy.
You've got to be kidding. I love the sound of the rain and I do find it relaxing, but this was just annoying."
Nockoff <SEP> Sucks. Nockoff of a good song. Don't get confused like i did and waste your money
Great song <SEP> This is my I'm going to work I need to get pumped song!
One Star <SEP> too expensive
Yay <SEP> Rock and roll dude.
Two Stars <SEP> Not what I thought it was.
Two Stars <SEP> Very mundane after a while.
"Not impressed <SEP> I made the mistake of downloading several free sample albumns, I did not realize that the quality was garbage, and that it would be such a pain to remove from my device.  Worse, I found the music repetitive and uninspiring."
"good choice of songs <SEP> I like it because the music quality is good and it is free to me!
The so so part come from the voice part, not sure it is because my speaker or not."
"Eh, it's ok...kinda <SEP> Well if you get this track because it features Max Bemis, don't wast your time. He's only in maybe, 10 seconds of the song and has like two, three lines maybe. Overall the song is, blah. I was expecting like a Two Tongues sound, but no. Unless you actually like this band, don;t get it."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this album.
"Best pop song of 2012 <SEP> Incredible song from an incredible band. The hook is massive, the lyrics have substance. Radio desperately needs this song. If you're considering buying this song, please follow these steps.

1. Buy the song
2. Fall in love
3. See the band live
4. Buy their new album Peace of Wild Things on September 11th
5. High Five all friends, family, and enemies"
dixie chicks were the best ever can't believe nat. put out this crap <SEP> dixie chicks were an awsum country combo the chemistry worked well i love this group they were and still are cutting edge but i think natilie needs some insperation or  the other chicks to find that magic they had i luv them chicks
"What Happenned to Her? <SEP> Sadly, Natalie Maines has lost her talent.  The voice is still there, but don't waste your money on this song."
"possibly the best <SEP> The original ""Sister Winter"" is a remarkable song in its own right, however Tracy Thorn takes this song and makes it reach new heights. This is possibly not just the best song on this album but also may be the best song released this holiday season."
"Waste of money <SEP> Bought this album, a waste of $12.
Why do groups try to hard to get new fans while alienating current fans and alienating more former fans?
Mike Riggs wants fans so bad he decide SotE will now do dubstep.
The dubstep takes away, drowns out, and over shadows SotE earlier stuff.
Dubstep is in every track.
Why in the hell would you do a dubstep version of the classic ""Funeral March"" is beyond me."
"The weakest of the 3 albums..... <SEP> Not a whole lot to write, the first two albums were great. This cd is ok for background noise but thats it. Feels like the songs are short as well, everytime I listen to it the cd is over before I know it. This last one Riggs went with Dubstep tencho on it. Not as extreme as Rob Zombies latest effort Mondo Sex Head but still bad. Could have been so much better if done right. Really, my advice....stay clear. Listen to the first two cds over and over."
"Solo Partridge <SEP> This is worth hearing, just for a laugh.  The thing is, Bonaduce barely sings on this.  There's another vocalist doing all the heavy lifting, with prepubescent Danny just ghosting the real singing.  It's funny, and sometimes that's better than boring."
Two Stars <SEP> Meant to get the whole album. Only got the song. Not loving Prime much anymore.
"It came on time and in good condition. I love the music <SEP> It came on time and in good condition. I love the music, too. It is well-produced (duh), and the musicality is top-notch, as are the lyrics. (Random side-note: I got my metal-fearing/disliking mother to read the lyrics, and said, ""See? Aren't these better than a lot of those modern repetitive worship songs?"" She agreed with me.)"
"Paradox <SEP> Christian Death Metal - Death Metal by a Christian band - I don't get it. Jesus was radical, but is this music that you listen to and get closer to god. I am really confused. Somebody explain to me how you can connect this to the bible and preaching the gospel."
Five Stars <SEP> Good stuff.
Five Stars <SEP> Bob at his lyrical best.
"The Best of the Latter Years <SEP> He continues to make wonderful music, but this track, and the album it lives on are truly extraordinary.  Recommended for anyone who wants to listen to the voice of experience."
Five Stars <SEP> musica tipica de puerto rico preciosa
"Sammy Adams <SEP> Absolutely love this song.

With my credits to amazon's music store it was very easy for me to pick and download the songs I wanted"
THIS SONG BLOWS! <SEP> LAME... SONG RECORDING SHOWS LOWER QUALITY AS YOU CAN NOT HEAR ANYTHING THAT IS BEING SUNG OVER THE HIGH BASS. THIS ARTIST IS A STIFF AND OBVIOUSLY WILL NEVER ATTAIN CHART TOPPING EXCELLENCE. GET LOST!
"good song <SEP> Good song, great message. You need to like Bluegrass and country gospel. That says it all. Don't need eight more words."
"Definitely Worth It <SEP> I went and saw Poor Moon a few years ago and have been listening to this album ever since. Kind of an indie folk/psychedelic rock feel. Great band, would recommend."
"I didn't buy this! <SEP> It might be good, but I didn't buy this so I can't really say. And I don't see it on my credit card that I purchased anything like this either. AND its not in my cloud. Don't know where they got the idea that I should rate it.

MT C"
"Disappointed <SEP> Nice selection of song choices, but everything was digital and synthesized instrumentation, not like original orchestral renditions. As always, Amazon did a wonderful job with this transaction."
"Love this song <SEP> This song just relaxes me and makes me smile.  Check out the video as well, it is perfect.  Well done PM!"
"Pretty, but excessively repetitive with too few lyrics <SEP> Pretty, but excessively repetitive with too few lyrics. I wish I hadn't purchased it and just listened for free on YouTube!"
"This is not a good song <SEP> I heard this sopng on Degrassi and was like wow I must have that song, it sounds so cool! but once you hear the entire song (not the snippet preview or what played in degrassi) it's actually a very boring piece of music. I think I've only listened to it once since I bought it. The song is slow and boring, with one climax that's good but nothing else."
"My wait is finally over <SEP> There are so few artist out now that can ""really"" sing. No enhancement boxes,  computer programs, or unnecessary noise & talking in the background to make it sound good. No smoke & mirrors. There are so few artist out now that can ""really"" sing. No enhancement boxes,  computer programs, or unnecessary noise & talking in the background to make it sound good. No smoke & mirrors. Frenchie is going to be one of the vocal greats like Aretha Franklin, Dinah Washington, Patti LaBelle, Roberta Flack and Whitney Houston to name a few. When Frenchie has her concert I know no one will be disapointed. Congrats girl. Do yo thang!"
"Don't waste your time <SEP> Awful! This racist bigot needs to just go away. She will never have the 15 minutes of fame she desperately seeks. Her porn career that got her kicked off idol failed and so has her lousy music ""career."""
"One of his best <SEP> Everything about this song, the humor, the irony, makes it, along with all of the songs on the album Blood on the Tracks, one of his best. He does here what Marilyn Monroe said when she said, """"I'm trying to find the nailhead, not just strike the blow."""
"Love electronic music <SEP> Love electronic music, especially if it has a great beat; Weekender is one of the songs I have in my Stationary Bike/Spinning playlist, and it motivates me.  Great song!"
Great song <SEP> The song is full of energy and has killer riffs. One of the better songs on the album. Definitively worth checking it out.
Disappointing and misleading. <SEP> NOT THE ONE FROM THE MOVIE. Cheapo instrumental.
"Young Blood Sure to Energize <SEP> This is a fantastic in your face album!!  Hardcore that is relateable!  Also, check out their live show!  Just empowering and motivating lyrics and music!!  All around great album and band!!"
"Great album <SEP> This album is great. High replayability, cool, relaxing tunes and best of all: it rocks! Eclectic mix of sounds while remaining unique, Nude Beach has nailed it. If you like classic rock or punk, lazy and hazy summer tunes or just straight up relaxing music check this album out. Also sounds amazing on vinyl; it was meant to be. Rock on Nude Beach and thanks for representing Northport!"
The title of this song said it all. <SEP> I'm building a neo-soul list on my ipod and I had to add this one to my list. It is worth a listen.
"A nice discovery <SEP> Absolutely love this record, especially the America suite on the second side.  Not easily defined with a mix of indie rock/pop and electronics.  My first album from Dan Deacon, and I really like what I hear.  The artwork reminds me of something found in an old elementary school library."
"A Stimulating Thrill Ride <SEP> I love stumbling onto an artist I haven't heard of before and absolutely falling in love with the music.  This is my first listen to Dan Deacon, and I love this album; after hearing it, I am going to acquire his other recordings.

The music in ""America"" is full of deep percussion, loaded with reverb in places, full of brain ticklers and drenched in audio sunshine...  and then in other places it is quieter and almost delicate.  The vocals are often presented more as harmonic washes of sound, occasionally almost subliminal, and all the time contributing to a high atmosphere.  This is heady stuff that bears repeated listening.

I am not sure I would go so far as to call Deacon's work a modern form of Art Rock, but it contains some of those creative elements.  I hear echoes of Brian Eno at times in the vocals, arrangements and treatments.  For this long-time fan of such music, Deacon's presentation in ""America"" can only be a good thing.

""America"" is exultant, exuberant, joyful.  It is thought-provoking, it is mentally stimulating, and you can dance to most of it.  What could be better?  Now on to ""Bromst"" and whatever else he has recorded.

Thanks Dan Deacon, for letting us inside your mind!"
Los Hermanos Banda de Salamanca <SEP> I chose this item because I was 100% sure I would like it. I know this band and I know they sing and play pure good. All they sing are hits.
Noise is not always music <SEP> Poor recording. Poor selection of songs
"Not what I wanted and not enjoyed. <SEP> The songs were the same as another album, and in my mind do not truly reflect the art or artists of Ireland.  If one wants to hear what one would hear in a crowded Pub this is OK, but not even good at that!"
"Love it <SEP> Love this album, listen to it in my car all the time! I absolutely love every song on here :)"
"This is NOT Oktoberfest music. <SEP> Awful, cheesy keyboard, techno-lite rubbish...I feel ripped off!"
FULL HUA <SEP> This album fills me full of HUA. It is now my insperation for my new license plate which will say FULLHUA. There is no greater pride than going full hua.
Not so hot <SEP> Not sure how sexy this music is as far as classical music goes. I was looking for something romantic and a bit steamy to write to and this has quality that is all over the place. This compilation is pretty much a dud.
killa song... I found about CERO on ... <SEP> killa song...I found about CERO on ceromundo.com
"The Stars are for the Performance, the Work is another matter <SEP> This is as splendid a performance of Elijah as you will ever expect to hear.  McCreesh is an expert at recreation, and here he has amassed massive forces to recreate Mendelssohn's oratorio as performed at an important 1846 Birmingham Festival.  Orchestra strings have been augmented as have woodwinds and brass, which here include wonderful serpent, an ophecleide, the even more rare bass ophecleide, period trombones and bass trombones, indeed the whole array of beautiful sweeping 19th century massive sound, a massive, yet expert and clear, powerful choir of 350 (no Mormon Tabernacle mush here), and as good an array of soloists as one could hope to find for this piece today, headed with the dramatic and forceful Elijah of Simon Kennlyside and a particularly radiant soprano solo from Rosemary Joshua.  The climaxes are a feast of sound, and the recording, extremely spacious, captures the grandiosity of the proceedings to perfection.  Yes there are smaller Elijahs with smaller forces, some like that by Robert Shaw with intermediate forces, but if one is going to go for Elijah, one might as well get it as it was served in its heyday, and how it enthralled the composer himself.  And Paul McCreesh's is as good as it is likely to get.

But then, there is the work itself.  It contains isolated spots of very beautiful music, such as the little trio ""Lift Thine Eyes"" quickly followed by the gorgeous chorus ""He Watcheth Over Israel"", up there with the Hebrides Overture and some of the Songs Without Words and the piano trios as truly superlative in Mendelssohn's canon.  Overall, Elijah is a bore. Imagine reading a book consisting of declarative sentences only and this is what Elijah sounds like.  It is Mendelssohn at his unimaginative worst. All the exotic period instruments dug up for this recording do not mask the dearth of orchestral color in this unfortunate score. Furthermore, the whole thing is cloaked in Victorian sanctimoniousness that makes one long for the tawdrier Italian operas of the period, full of poisons, sword-fights, and damsels in distress, not to mention colorful, energetic music by mostly second-rate composers.  But on a more serious vein, contemporaneously with this piece, Hector Berlioz was writing his Requiem, a true masterpiece, far more moving than this four-square exercise in Victorian self-serving piety. Berlioz's was a piece looking to the future, for massive forces intelligently deployed and sparsely used, a truly great composition whereas Elijah is not even a  good one.  I plan no trips any time soon to Birmingham, or Liverpool, or Manchester, so maybe I will avoid stoning.  I don't think I am the first to point out that this oratorio is a beached whale (maybe one on Jonah would have been livelier!).  I cannot honestly say that if somehow your music collection feels incomplete without an Elijah, this would be a fun one to have, because there is no way I can conceive of Elijah as being anything near ""fun."" But should the hole in your shelf require filling, like mine I felt did because the other versions I had never redeemed the piece, this one will provide great sounds to show off your sound system, without still redeeming the piece. Otherwise, you'd be wise to explore other romantic choral music, like McCreesh's own excellent performance of the Berlioz Requiem, or Britten's performance of Schumann's Scenes from Faust, etc. There's also much better Mendelssohn than this."
"epic indie pop/rock led by unusual vocals <SEP> British band debut of epic indie pop/rock led by unusual vocals in a soaring, expansive
  atmosphere; with sing-along hooks, synthesizers and prog-glam meets Brit-pop elements.
  Sometimes recalls artists like Ultrasound, Placebo, Radiohead, Night Moves, the Besnard
  Lakes, Antony and the Johnsons."
"Partridge Family <SEP> Good song. Nice beat. If you are a fan of the show, this is the song for you to enjoy."
wrong Cd in case <SEP> wrong CD in case  the CD for Ami Nueva Manera was in the case which doesn't belong to this alblum???
Did not sound like the original Platters <SEP> Did not sound like the original Platters. Might be a later group with one or two of the originals. But I only bought one song.
GREAT record <SEP> Fast shipping and good price
Five Stars <SEP> Chris Knight always delivers really great heart felt songs!
"Amazing, soothing song by Latha Ji <SEP> I have listen this song in Shirdi for the first time. Its a very good healing song from sweet voice of Lathaji about Sai Maharaj!"
Magic Slim at his finest <SEP> You can't go wrong with a Magic Slim CD. This is one of my favorites from him.
"Deanna Bogart - A musical treasure <SEP> If musical excellence, joy, cheerfulness and a love for people are qualities you seek in an entertainer, Deanna Bogart is for you. In person, these traits are quickly evident. If you listen to her recordings, the same qualities are there, but not as easily captured in the studio as in a live venue."
"Steve Friedt <SEP> Steve Friedt has (since I first heard him) gone through many musicians to create this sound. Now finally it was captured on disk by very qualified professional recording and producers.

Bring Forth The Element is only the first wave of Steve Friedt and his band ZYNC. A new sound has developed with the addition of a new drummer and vocalist but I know that I still listen to ""Bring Forth The Element"" and it ROCKS me every time."
"I heard Batch in St Thomas at street vendor and loved it, and I thought this cd was like ... <SEP> I expected
 this to be more reggae grass roots.  It's a little too much Jah.  I heard Batch in St Thomas at street vendor and loved it, and I thought this cd was like the older cd I had heard."

Memories <SEP> I remember this show growing up and I wanted the song for the longest time. I like that is longer than the intro.
Organ instrumental <SEP> This is not the best version of the song I've heard. I give it a C- and I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it.
"The original sucks! <SEP> Downloaded the wrong version, meant to download a cover. The original sucks!"
Super great song/singer <SEP> Love this song.  Discovered it watching a TV show that used it.  Perfect
Two Stars <SEP> Don't like it
"Don't pay for it... <SEP> I got the album because somehow I had Amazon Mp3 credits... Well, it is not even worth the zero dollars I spent..."
"Great Talent! <SEP> Thomas Rhett shows a great range of talents with moving ballads such as ""Beer With Jesus"" and fun songs such as ""I Need Something to do With My Hands""."
I am glad it is available for free streaming through Amazon Prime <SEP> I am glad it is available for free streaming through Amazon Prime.  It is not worth spending money on this track and sadly not even worth the time to listen to it.
Nice sound. <SEP> Very pleasant new age music.
Waste of Money <SEP> Modern R&B with Lindsey Stirling playing the fiddle though it; you can just barely hear her for the rest of the noise.  I should have sampled this via YouTube first to keep from wasting my money.
Five Stars <SEP> Love Lindsey Sterling. She is great. I enjoy this song.
"You've never heard creepy house music before, right? Good. Because we're super original. <SEP> I was initially drawn to this album by the artwork, and my tenacity for buying any CD I like the artwork of. What came out of that artwork was not what some punk jumping across dumpsters onto cars led me to expect. Unless that punk has a couple ecstacy up his bum and has somehow managed to be the only kid at the angst driven street rave to get on the album cover.
  Now, I enjoy all kinds of music. This particular group, I suppose quite aptly titled, ""Crypts"", have made an album of dark, gothy, house music, that sincerely hopes you've never heard of dark, gothy, house music before. If you have, I swear to you, there is nothing new or fresh here. If The Ministry put out a house album, this would be it. It's very synthetic music, and very industrial, very distorted, at times wretched and sick, at others, very industrial, very distorted, but with pop-esque undertones with a hip hop-ish backbone. Can't really understand a word of it, don't much care to. The whole CD kinda felt like a rave for people who hate raves and other people, but really dig heroine and sitting alone in dark rooms hating raves and other people.
  One entire listen takes about thirty-three minutes, and after five it just runs together into the afore mentioned distorted, synth-laden (actually, it's all synth really) mess of over-production, with no real high points. However, at no point is it worse than it was before. But maybe that's because the song before was forgettable, and come next track you're still pretty much hearing the same thing, albeit the tempo changed, and the words are in new places. Maybe. I stopped paying attention.
  If you really, really like the color black, drugs, and dark electronica/house music on the same record, maybe buy it. Or, if you ever thought that The Cure sounded too happy and played too many actual instruments and sang way too well, then this might appeal to you. If not, best avoid it.
  Maybe that's what the kid on the cover was doing all along. Oh well."
Awesome music. <SEP> She's a great artist. She has a great voice and her songs are from the heart. She has a wonderful voice.
Could be a classic? <SEP> This is a  very likable project. Track 7 is a giantly gorgeous piece of music with the wonderful vocals. There is plenty of dubtronic cruising through these tracks. Very smooth and very cool and very recommended. Get the CD.The sound blows any MP3 away for this kind of deep low end music.
One Star <SEP> Poor.

Love <SEP> Love it great song
"Like the orginal song <SEP> I still like this song, but on my Mp3, it sounds tinny..not quite like I remembered.  I used to have it on the old cassette tapes."
"Liked only one song from this album <SEP> Only liked ""bridge of sorrow""

The rest didn't have the Cirque defSoleil feel.

Bridge of Sorrow song had sweetness and depth."
Two Stars <SEP> This CD had only two songs that I really liked.  I would have done better purchasing them as singles.
Five Stars <SEP> Pure devotion
"What should one make of this? <SEP> I don't know what to make of this.  As a Bruckner-lover, I found myself completely off-balance listening to this.  I'm not a jazz fan to start with (and that may be a great reason to ignore this review).  And while I'll give the performers credit for inventiveness, I guess at the end of the day my question is: to what end?  Will a Bruckner-lover want to hear Anton Bruckner's music and themes mangled and played in a genre and manner which would be completely foreign--and probably offensive to the man who wrote them or anyone who truly loves them?  Or will this appeal to jazz fans who have no exposure to Bruckner and may find something interesting in this?

I doubt the latter, because while this performance preserves the notes of some of the themes, what it does not preserve is the spirit/essence of the music, which is what makes Bruckner's symphonies so moving and distinctive.  Will it bring Bruckner-lovers to jazz?  Well, in a meaningless sample of one, the answer is no.  Will it bring jazz-lovers to Bruckner?  I doubt it.

There's no question in my mind that these performers truly love Bruckner's music, or else they wouldn't have done what they did here.  But I'm not so sure that love of the music translates into doing riffs on it in a way that to my ears fundamentally mangles and distorts it."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this show
Five Stars <SEP> My kids love this!
"Five Stars <SEP> Would like to buy another one,CD is starch already"
Love Rehab 2 <SEP> Very good album. One of the best cds made by Tucka. Great music by one of the best blues artist.
"love the content, difficult to play <SEP> I am still trying to find out how to download to my device. it keeps sending me to Amazon cloud but I want my music at my fingertips with our without internet connectivity."
Five Stars <SEP> Love the rhythm of Tucka's voice. Ol' school meets new school!
"This is 4 ""JOE""...... <SEP> I give it 5 stars only because it brings back memories of a boyhood friend who recently left us, he was a big Jazz fan who loved the Crusaders ....."
One Star <SEP> Poor Sound Quality
"Talkin' to the Wino still great! <SEP> David Lindley  ROCKS!!  Hard to find better master of string instruments, actually, I am not sure there even is one!"
Great <SEP> My 15 month old daughter loves it! Its what calms her down in the car! It also helps with our 3yr old son.
"Ummm, just no. Realize these are re-recordings of ... <SEP> Ummm, just no. Realize these are re-recordings of the original songs, with minimal editing and engineering, and often 20+ years later. It would be kind to say these artists' voices have ""evolved"" since the original. Don't expect the same versions you grew up with, and don't expect remotely the same sound quality. If you have Prime, it's free. And it's WORTH. EVERY. PENNY."
Too abrupt. <SEP> The music starts so abruptly that I couldn't use the song with my preschool classes. There was no intro at all. Not what I wanted.
"Not the ""pass the bean bag"" song I wanted, sample is not the same. <SEP> The song that downloaded (which I paid for twice, thinking maybe it was my error), is not the one that samples! I want the sample one, NOT the one that downloaded, ugh, very frustrated."
"Hope and Frankieeee! When Bobbysoxers ruled! <SEP> This is early '40s time, WW2 is raging and Frankie was so skinny Hope makes a joke about the microphone stand shadow covering him up. I'm a Hope nut, and while there are no real nuggets here, he mines the jokes for whatever gold they hold."
"Compiliation and summary <SEP> Wonderful album combining the childlike whimsy, social justice stance, mystery of romance and deep spiritual insight and integrity encased in lovely musical artistry which we have received from Paul Stookey through these many years.  All of these threads come together in this CD.  Thank you!"

It's a great album. I wish a few other songs were ... <SEP> It's a great album.  I wish a few other songs were on it as well.
Five Stars <SEP> The Australian Pink Floyd band is as good as you can get without actually being Pink Floyd.
Sound of Silence <SEP> This is a very good piece of art from an Iranian young artist and musician. I strongly suggest that to all the iranian folks
"watched 2 videos, got the cd! <SEP> Came across their site, watched 2 videos, got the cd, love it!  Came here recently and I really hate that I miss it.  Also the fact that the show was only $7 & the cd is a simple cardboard cut out..helped me like em even more.  Those 2 videos I watched are maybe still my favorite songs hahaha but still, it's fantastic, hope they come back!"
"Mas de lo mismo <SEP> Mas de lo mismo, esperaba una evolucion musical, verdaderamente es una pena ver que Yolandita se convirtio en una artista Local debido a la pobreza musical y estar mas preocupada de tratar de parecerse a su hija Noelia, que by the tienn mil veces mejor propuesta musical que la madre y no soy fan de ninguna de las dos, solo hablo de music.  A Yolandita se le respeta pero paso su tren, y lo que se hereda no se hurta y Noelia va camino con su nuevo material a convertirse en una artista mundial,"
"Same Download as ""Christmas Is For The Family"" <SEP> Still poor quality. See review on ""Christmas is for the Family"".
This is a Fantastic Chrismas Album... Amazon needs a better
resource for the download. This IS NOT it."
sucks <SEP> U didn't like it i actually thought it sucked guess thats why it was so cheap not sure if id buy more
Two Stars <SEP> Not much punch.
Very disappointed in this purchase <SEP> Very disappointed in this purchase.  An orchestra was listed somewhere on the description but this is only a piano.  I suppose that must mean the piano player played for a specific orchestra.  It was not at all what I was looking for. I wanted an orchestral arrangement of Tristan and Isolde without the singing.  I found what I was looking for elsewhere.
And to sing the classic Nikita in a Reggae style is awesome. Give it a listen <SEP> Eddie Lovette has one of the cleanest male voices I have heard. And to sing the classic Nikita in a Reggae style is awesome. Give it a listen. I highly recommend.
"Love it and love her! <SEP> I love this remix EP. Yes, it's a bit of a gimmick, but everything she puts out is fantastic. Consistent, fun and fabulous!"
"He's good <SEP> She's good, nothing wrong with the tune.  It's not my style, so it's more wasted on me.  The song is surprisingly bluesy.  It's well done and a decent mesh of old and new.  He's got a decent voice and it's easy on the ears.  It turns out he's more versatile than one would think.  Check out his singing on ""Breathe"" with Meytal and her band for a good example of that."
3 year old loves this <SEP> My 3 year old daughter loves the Barbie Princess and Popstar movie.  While playing Here I am she was singing and dancing to it.  I recommend this sound track to all Princess and the Popstar fans.
There are quite a few excellent players on the jazz scene <SEP> What can I say. Tri4th has my attention. J Wave has come so far and they sound so fresh. There are quite a few excellent players on the jazz scene .Tired of the same old same old? Treat your ears and brain to this quartet then use it as a springboard to open a universe of uniquely Japanese jazz. Kudos to Amazon for carrying Asian artists now. Now add more. We will buy.
"No more MP3 purchases from Amazon <SEP> This was my first MP3 purchase. I can't find a way to access the contents in order to burn a CD that I might enjoy in my car. I can listen to the music on my Windows 7 computer, or my iPhone, but I cannot burn a CD. I'm not a
 computer expert, and maybe I'm missing something, but this is my last time purchasing an MP3.

As for the music itself, since I play the flute myself, of course this CD would be more interesting to me than for a non-playing person. The performances are very good, and it's fun to listen to the sonorities produced by a large group of flutists.
For the average person, however, it may be a little too much."
"Great Redo-Remix <SEP> Excellent redo-remix - Loved this song when it was in the 80s - great powerful high-energy dance track!
Mixes well with Top 40 Dance Trax - Putting it in my latest mix."
BlackButterfly <SEP> This is the first time I used the cloud downloader for a MP3 song and it was awesome.  I love the song and play it constantly.  I would recommend this process and plan to use it again soon.  Look forward to using it to download to a CD so I can play the downloads on other mediums.
Five Stars <SEP> Simply amazing.
Long Live <SEP> Best album ever. I would buy it again in a heart beat. The Chariot really went out with a bang.
Four Stars <SEP> Definitely good for running!
"Fantastic! <SEP> A wonderful collection of big band era tunes about the best holiday there is! While the Christmas songs from this era get played year after year, and thus have remained in the public ear, most of these ditties have been lost to iniquity. Thankfully, this collection (along with the companion volume 2) have brought these little numbers back from the grave! Fun songs that are good for all ages."
Soul Salsa <SEP> I've been following Whitney career's around San Diego for a couple of years and she can belt it out. She has taken music to a new upper level -- and highly recommend this album. You will not be disappointed; make sure your volume is set to 11.
"good song, by a great artist. <SEP> this is a really catchy song by a great artist I really enjoy listening to it. and the quality of the song is great because I bought it from Amazon."
"Hallucinogenic Cumbias <SEP> Trippy psychedelic cumbia tunes.  Some electro tomfoolery makes it just disorienting enough (adding wow and flutter, sped up vocals), without sounding over produced or losing track of hip shaking rhythm.  It sounds like it might be some crazy lost 60-70s group, though they are the here and now, unjustly obscure the past decade.  Definitely on the fun and accessible end of the avant garde with shades of Sun Ra and the early Residents, they deserve great credit for coming up with something fresh, or at least resurrecting the sound of something even more obscure.  Apparently ""they"" are a 1 man band - a wildly versatile cat who is a classical composer, member of Columbian dance bands, and creator of this uncategorizable lunacy.  It probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, but at the very least, most will stop in their tracks and say, ""what is that?""  Restoring my faith in the potential of modern music."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!!
"what a pretty picture <SEP> A classic album, It plays just fine
just an addition to the borgir collection"
"HELP! <SEP> ATTENTION!  The track listing is not given.  Please tell me what the bonus tracks are! DIMMU IS AWESOME!  GET ALL THEY HAVE!  I have this album in a non-import version.  It is an E.P. with I think 3 new  [at that time] songs, 1 cover[accept's metal heart awesomely redone] and 3  live songs. And of course Raabjorn speiler.....They put that song on like  every  album!  But it's great.  But I can't tell you about the 2 bonus  songs because I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE!"
"Strictly of historical interest <SEP> I would discourage purchase of this disc except for those who have a particular admiration for one of more of these artists.  Even so, other packagings of these same performances are out there for those who want to concentrate on a given pianist.  Sound quality is poor in the concerto, not much better in the Totentanz."
"Buy these splendid performances in decent transfers, not this garbage <SEP> The performances themselves on this disc are classics.  Toscanini was actually a fine Gershwin conductor, perhaps not as fluent in the jazz idiom as some others but with a firm grasp of the composer's internal logic and structure.  I doubt you will find a better or more coherent performance of American in Paris, and in all of these pieces the conductor's attention to detail and meticulous phrasing and dynamics serve the music well.  And even Toscanini's legendary swift tempi are a match to the composer's own performances.  Earl Wilde is his usual magnetic self in the Rhapsody, and Oscar Levant gives a highly-charged and (to me) convincing reading of the Concerto.

So why two stars?  Because these transfers are pretty bad.  They appear to have been made from old LPs, with little or no filtering or adjustment for dynamics or pitch (or even editing for glitches in the source material).  The result is strident strings, obvious surface noise, dynamic overload in loud passages and, in several cases, skips in the music (like what you'd get if you had a scratch or a small particle stuck to the grooves of an LP).

There are better transfers of the Rhapsody and Concerto and I encourage you to buy those instead.  As for American in Paris, this is the only CD copy of the live 1943 performance I know of that's currently available.  Toscanini did record the piece again in the studio in 1945 and that recording is still available on an RCA CD.  Like most Toscanini studio performances I've been able to compare to live ones, the studio version is a bit stiff, but the performances are essentially the same, the sound is better, and it remains my favorite.

Go elsewhere."
"Guess you must love it or hate it <SEP> This gets a lot of airplay on the new-age music channel I get through my internet provider. I don't like it at all. The line they repeat again and again---if the ice breaks under my feet, will you catch me?---makes a bit more sense now that I've seen the title ""looking glass,"" because maybe it's the question we should each ask in the mirror. If it's an art piece about self-doubt, then so be it, but (a) listeners should be able to grasp that without the ""cheat sheet"" of the title, and (b) since it is alternately asked by a male voice and then a female voice, I initially thought they were speaking to each other, which frankly is plain annoying to listen to time after time."
Janis Martin <SEP> I really like this CD by Janis Martin the Blanco sessions from the first track as long as I'm movin  to long white Cadillac if you like rockabilly pick up a copy of this great record.
Great songs from an almost forgotten early rock icon. <SEP> This release was long overdue.  Janis still delivers the same powerful music she did over forty years ago.  She will be missed.
"Argh. <SEP> My husband wanted me to order this for him, so I did. We listened to it in the car on a longer trip and it almost drove me nuts. This isn't anything like Elvis and whoever gave her that nickname has not listened to enough early Elvis Presley. This isn't even in the Wanda Jackson vein of rock'n'roll; it actually sounds like something very white that came right out of Nashville."
Five Stars <SEP> I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!Deserves more than five (5) stars ...
"Another excellent song from The Rippingtons! <SEP> Always look forward to seeing what The Rippingtons will do next -- and as usual, they didn't disappoint!  Keep up the excellent work, Russ!"
"great cd, couple songs <SEP> great cd , couple songs ,are really great."
Built To Last was terrible. Cant believe they released this <SEP> Built To Last was terrible. Cant believe they released this CD
Let down <SEP> This was a complete let down. I heard 2 songs before I bought this. The first 2 tracks. They were great but the rest of the album seems to get worse and more generic as each song passes.
Not for Me <SEP> Sounds like church organ music.  Very dark sounds.
"Love listening to stay focused <SEP> Great listening music for staying focused.  Whenever I'm feeling distracted, irritated and unbalanced, I start listening to bring me back to a peaceful place."
"Very inspiring! <SEP> A ""Must Listen""."
"Nice <SEP> It's okay, but I was lookiing for something more soul touching. It's updated music but I do miss those songs that really changed your life."
Don't <SEP> I thought this was Jennifer Lopez performing Let's get Loud.  Does not matter. because it does not play well and really did not download to my laptop.  I got to a meeting to perform with the MP3 and it would not play because there was no Internet service.
"Relaxing, soothing music <SEP> Desatero is wonderful relaxing music. I especially liked Min Ros which I have heard numerous times over Soundscapes channel on my TV set. This music is in counterpoint to the cruel, hostile world that we presently live in. The more I listen to it the more certain I am that this CD calms my body and soul. Bring it on! George Vassallo"
"Very Happy With This CD <SEP> I am very glad I purchased this.  I heard ""Looking Glass"" on MC Soundscapes and had to try it out.  Glad I did.  WHile CD is a treat.  Very good music IMO.  Audio quality is excellent."
"Coltrane Reeder is totally awesome love him so smooth get your wine and put ... <SEP> Coltrane Reeder is totally awesome
love him so smooth get your wine and put on some Coltrane and that's all she wrote!"
One Star <SEP> This song sucks!!! I wanted the Jay-Z song.
"THIS SONG IS AWESOME! CLEAN VERSION! <SEP> I heard this song on the Mindy Project and I thought, ""I have to find out what song is! They always have great songs on that show! So fun to dance to!"
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great album, delivered correctly (y)"
"Album rocks <SEP> It alternates between slightly aggressive rock sounds and lighter ballads, but entertaining from start to finish. In both the lighter and heavier songs, there is an emphasis on rhythmic guitar riffs, so when combined with the very melodic vocals, you get some super catchy songs.

I feel like these guys went back to their roots, then added in some experimentation and it really paid off."
"Elephant Steps <SEP> I sure wish Sony would see fit to release this on CD.  An old fashioned happening extranaganza.  An early example of rock informed opera/musical.  While this never sounds like Zappa it does have his zany sense of frivolity.  This work is much loved and my CD transfer will have to do for now.  Here's the headnote on the jacket:  A Fearful Radio Show with Pop singers, Opera Singers, Orchestra, Rock Band, Electronic Tape, Raga Group, Tape Recorder, Gypsy Ensemble and Elephants all under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas.  Electronic music by Pril Smiley."
"You want satanic, this is it. <SEP> The group enigma is totally satanic"
Awesome Worship <SEP> Awesome Worship
Love it! <SEP> Eddie keep praising the Lord! This while CD is great I pray all who listen to this is totally blessed
Two Stars <SEP> They have had better
"Four Stars <SEP> Amazing, peaceful,  and emotive."
Many good reasons <SEP> Heard him play it live and had to get it. Doug Deming is awesome both as a guitar player and singer. Could listen to him all night (and just did!).
"Get original, not cover version <SEP> I bought it thinking it was the original version.  The sample track didn't reveal it until I made the purchase.  I wasn't able to find out how to return it since I did go and buy the original."
"great sound, great Fink <SEP> quality vinyl, great sound, great Fink! Just buy it!"
"OK <SEP> The song was OK, but a little bit unoriginal.  I don't think I'll listen to it much.  Two stars ..."
"Forget you clicked on the link for this album <SEP> This is a terrible idea, and a terrible album.  The Beatles would never construct a composition remotely close to any of these songs.  For a faithful mashup, check out The Money or the Gun - Stairways to Heaven (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stairways-Heaven-The-Money-Gun/dp/B000BJTJE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stairways Heaven The Money Gun</a>&nbsp;Much better than this. AVOID. THIS. PRODUCT. *sigh*"
"Heard it on the radio <SEP> Wish I wouldn't have bought this song.  I didn't end up liking it at all. It's got too much pop, not enough substance."
"Don't Bother <SEP> Lousy, lousy song."
song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 ... <SEP> song was great BUT Amazon does NOT let you download the MP3 more than once. So IF you happen to delete it or LOSE it like I did by aaccident. You are screwed. Will not buy MP3 from amazon again.
hardest song ever <SEP> juicy j goes ham and its glorious everyone should listen to this song for real or else they're missing out
"can't dance to it <SEP> i love her voice, so unique. This song is soothing in a strange way. Recommend it. I'll check out some of her other music"
More great music by Iris Dement <SEP> More great music by Iris Dement. Caught her unique voice on a John Prine CD and researched her music. I've been hooked ever since.
Five Stars <SEP> It's Iris - What more can you say?
One Star <SEP> This record was damaged. There was a huge scratch on the album.
One Star <SEP> never the it
Two Stars <SEP> This is okay. I was actually looking for the remix with De La Ghetto.
"Yes yes yes-Sweet Jamaica-mi come soon <SEP> I first heard this song on Tony Carr's This is Reggae Music @ WPFW..I tell you it made me bounce in my bed and then I got up and started dancing and singing! So many of the artist I love are in on this lovely and great song. Mi listen to it  everyday, it feeds mi soul and makes mi heart glad, and mi long to go to Jamaica-soon."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful song!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
"Wonderful <SEP> These string quartets are beautiful.  Of course, I rank Novaks Orchestral music as some of the finest.  This composer's music deeply appeals to me, and the String Quartets did not let me down."
Trenet At His Best <SEP> Great Song ... especially as used in the movie Sheltering Sky.
"No Twist, All Great Music!! <SEP> Another lovely album from Hey Romeo. The vocals are amazing! The songs are beautiful, ranging many different styles of country music. Some songs have a Bluegrass feel to them, while others make ya want to get up and dance! A full compliment of excellent talent make this album one to enjoy over and over and over again!"
"So I would recommend, not buying it <SEP> I have misplaced this product,if you get this. You might misplace it too. So I would recommend,not buying it."
"Barely There! <SEP> Just 2 measure of drum beat.  Also, it needs editing because of the space and the end of the sample so it's nto ready to be looped without some tailoring."
"Awesome Music for my Storytimes at the Library <SEP> Absolutely love the music... it speaks to kids and adults alike :-)
I use this CD in my Storytimes at the Library for all ages... plenty of songs to use for scarves, shakers, and parachute in my baby storytimes... plenty of songs for the older kids who like action based songs!"
"I was turned onto Projected by my favorite band, Sevendust <SEP> I was turned onto Projected by my favorite band, Sevendust. If you're a fan of heavily guitar driven yet melodic rock music definitely check out this album. I'm only disappointed that I hadn't heard of this album sooner, but now I'm up to speed and on board for the next upcoming Projected release!"
If this doesn't transport you to some ecstatic dreamscape you don't have a soul <SEP> Easily one of the most beautiful tracks I've ever heard in my life. Sounds a lot like Lana Del Rey. Couldn't tell you how many times I've fallen to sleep with this on on loop. Might be my favorite song ever. Need I say more?
A waste of $.99 <SEP> It's choppy and incomplete. I was expecting a useable RuPaul acapella but that's not what this is. I don't see how this track passes as a finished product
Love it! <SEP> The songs in this book are great! I am very pleased with it. Great Christmas gift for the your vocalist!
Great Work <SEP> This is an awesome ministry.  I have thoroughly enjoyed listening.  Continue to spread the word and God will make room for the ministry.
I pay for pandora one so i don't have to ... <SEP> I pay for pandora one so i don't have to hear ads. I don't appreciate you slipping an ad into your track to bypass that. Forever thumbs down from me when a song of yours comes on.
"I love the cover art and the music holds true to ... <SEP> I love the cover art and the music holds true to that concept. Yes, you can go home again and it's worth the effort to make the journey."
"So smooth! <SEP> This song is  so true and on point!  Alex's sound is amazing, and I can't wait to hear other releases from him."
Five Stars <SEP> Thad's music is a blessing to all who hear the calling!
Great relaxer music <SEP> Very nice and relaxing music. Used it to relax on a flight to and from Hawaii
Five Stars <SEP> Absolutely great music.
"No singing -- what is this? <SEP> There's not a vocal on this, and it sounds like something someone arranged on his Casio. My mistake; I cannot recommend this."
"has no original jacket. <SEP> where is it now?
wanted that cover more than single record.
already have multiple cds about bohemian rhapsody.
has not its jacket, no needed this matter."
"Questionable sales practice <SEP> I really like this album, but this has to be the noisiest vinyl I've ever heard.
Edit: This was sold to me as sealed, but it was used and resealed."
One Star <SEP> Total irresponsible and seemingly scamming salesmanship
Burn in the spotlight <SEP> It is a very good cd. It arrived very quickly. Was in excellent shape. Nothing missing. Was a little more than I expected to pay but at the same time I couldn't find it anywhere.
Four Stars <SEP> Fun novelty tune.
"This is a very fun selection of old songs <SEP> This is a very fun selection of old songs, some specifically written for Halloween, others with fitting subjects. My only complaint--and it's a small one, considering the enjoyment the album brings me--is that some of the tracks badly needed to be remastered for sound quality."
Great! <SEP> 2nd in a series of classic songs you never hear anywhere. Adds a real antiquity to the season while fitting the holiday perfectly.
"Playing the Norrington Card <SEP> While those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it, it does not mean that ""reductio ad Hitlerum"" should rule the roost. In other words, a viewpoint or action should not be refuted merely because it can be linked somehow to Hitler. This proposition means nothing to my critics within the Australian Knappertsbusch Association who continue to liken my ""assertive leadership"" and explosive rants to the Big A. It's disgusting.

Similarly, ""Reductio ad Rogerum"" is a like-phenomenon. It contends that just because a performance exhibits a feeble one-card-trick (say, no vibrato) to the exclusion of everything else (musicality, thought, innerness) does not mean that it's necessarily associated with Sir Roger Norrington. Thoman Fey, in his dreadful Haydn series, supports this contention. Jeggy too, advocate of brisk efficiency, comes into frame. By all means, give unto Roger what belongs to Roger (Rule 303 comes to mind at this point - metaphorically speaking), but he shouldn't monopolise the parameters of incompetence.

That's the theory. Here's Norrington in practice. I'd like to say that it's a forgettable affair but sadly that's not the case. Nor does he take a single trick. I've yet to hear a more brainless performance of the slow movement of the Clock - since when does Andante equate to Prestissimo? Infinitesimal delays - a denoter of mastery - are absent per se. With the elimination of vibrato, swarms of bees, accompanied by the odd mouse or two, come to mind at innumerable points. There's little or no ""ascent"" in these readings: time-beating and repetition are all. At 19'24"", it's death-by-repeats in the first movement of the Prague - to no vivid end.  The student-orchestra in question is what it is and the conductor fails to elicit anything more from it. It makes heavy weather of the contrapuntal development in K 503 / 1.

""Reductio ad Rogerum"" is an obstruction to clear thinking. Norrington himself, baton in hand, is obfuscation. Fine though it be, heed the distinction!"
better late than never <SEP> so incredible. glad i found out about this. feels like a classic.
"Great sound <SEP> Heard them on the TV show ""Haven"" and was impressed. Love both of their albums, Hope they produce more in the future."
What a beautiful voice. <SEP> Really enjoying this! Wish I could find her earlier CD Open The Heavens. I've  worn my copy out. What a beautiful  voice.
"Next big deal <SEP> We have seen Logan Mize live 2 times made me like his music even more.  He is a great songwriter and has a great original sound.  Nobody in Nashville has a lot of great tracks.  Rock N Roll Band is my cuurent favorite.  Great music, great sound, great storytelling in the writing.  and while u are at buy his first album is great as well."
Not worth anything <SEP> You get one meow and that's it. 99c seems a lot to pay for that.  Couldn't preview or I'd know better.
"Heart-opening and ear-pleasing. <SEP> Electric guitars, banjo, and strings co-exist peacefully on this beautiful album of new and rerecorded songs. As always, Father Peter's music has a lot of soul--you can feel the love pouring from each note. ""Jesus"" and ""Holy Mary"" are heartbreakingly beautiful experiences of these great beings."
"really well done <SEP> Some of the songs are beautiful and heartwarming, others are fun and others are like an inspiring anthem that makes you want to get up and change the world right then. The music is really different and rich and the lyrics are real, deep and meditative. I highly recommend this album."
"Who produced this mess? <SEP> The recording sounds like it was performed in a large room with a single microphone.  The Folk Songs are my favorite Berio piece, but it is impossible to listen to it without getting angry at the poor recording quality.  The quality is a bit better in the Sequenza for Viola, which is a fantastic performance."
Not the original song <SEP> Live version of the song...... do not like it.
fantastic band! <SEP> Good range of music from grittier hard rocking sound to slow soft sounds .... If I were a music promoter i would pay attention ...but im not and I have ADD and eight kids so I can't pay attention ... but in all seriousness I have followed this band from afar since 2009 and have loved their music - Augustine's Song is very special to me.
Seventies Funk Stinks <SEP> Every song on this album was a classic. However the live renditions were poorly received..Some cuts were almost unintelligible. I wish there was a way to be refunded for this disappointing musical review.
70's Funk - 25 Miles <SEP> This is a poor version of the song 25 Miles - it cuts off at the end!  If I could I would have sent it back!
"That was wasted time & money <SEP> I couldn't get it to download as a ring tone, the reason why i downloaded it was because it said it could be used for ring tone. That was wasted time & money."
Coast Guard Song Truncates. <SEP> Song terminates early.  Last few bars are missing!  Three of six military songs I bought and downloaded had this problem.  Repeating the download to a new folder didn't help.
Good cadences <SEP> I love them!!!
"One Star <SEP> Not all Army, more Marine than any thing."
One Star <SEP> I'd like to know what is on this album before purchase
Very Talented <SEP> Beautiful voice!!  Unique and creative.  Definitely a new fan!!
Great pop record <SEP> What more can we say about Lianne La Havas. This is more  spare than her second record but she is one of the most talented pop singer-songwriters of her generation. She refuses to bend to convention or trends and her songs are honest and revealing. And oh yeah that voice--that extraordinary voice. Great pop record.
love it <SEP> smooth and easy listening
"The clip plays the best part, the rest, not so much <SEP> Also, it doesn't sound natural.  That weird huge-area sounding thing you hear, isn't just the clip.

Oh yah, I'm listening to it as I write and it gets worse."
"This is an introduction <SEP> You have to buy the other ""lessons"" in order to get anything out of this. I was very disappointed. It is literally instructions."
"Great encouragement and support for writing <SEP> I was skeptical, but I must say that I'm experiencing real results from this. His programs are having a positive effect on many aspects of my life."
"Talented Artist with A Passionated Voice <SEP> I discovered Lianne LaHavas one day while watching a music television station, and I was intrigued. She is young, beautiful, well composed, and a true singer. She and Mara Hruby are rarities in this current day sea of noise, artificial sounds, and ""artists"" who do not know what art is. Au Cinema is a deliciously adult song free of the usual ""rub me up and lick me down"" nonsense. It speaks of love and desire flowing from a voice that is honey-laced goodness. I look forward to hearing more from her."
Love IT! <SEP> I am a huge fan of LJ and he always brings it. Got a chance to meet him and he is just a good ol' boy.
"Way to bring it <SEP> I was looking forward to this new release by LJ Echols and he does not disappoint. With cds having alot of filler songs and maybe two or three good songs on them nowadays, I'm glad LJ took his time to write some good songs. You can just put this cd on and let it ride. Two thumbs way up!"
"A Hand for Holmboe/Katrine Ring/Dacapo <SEP> Here is the rundown:
1. A Nice Cup of Tea
Chopped up phrases of an orchestra piece interrupted by large `fur'matas by a cat purring and tea pouring. It can't get worse than this, can it?
Kaningrin
2. Four measure loop interrupted by brief varied string orchestral phrase. Please shoot me now. Then it stutters with some signal processing, some sound effects and laughing and clearing throats. Have you shot me yet?
Skynd digt
3. A two measure loop of piano going through a plugin with more interrupting orchestral parts. Elementary my dear Watson. Then a long cantabile passage of piano--not hearing a lot of manipulation-or am I missing something? Then is goes into reverb. Here comes the 2 measure loop, then back to a primitive da capo. Why hasn't someone shot me yet?
4. Helikopter
This is a little more creatively mashed-up featuring a long granular pedal but very little signal-processing on anything-just samples of Holmboe's music overtop. The word `genius' springs to mind. Again another da capo. You can't make this stuff up.
5. Fuglene
Opens with warmed-over Hindemith interspersed by bird chirps. Is anyone making my coffin? This is more brief samples of the composer with some tiny effects then the da capo.
6. Undervejs
Another pedal, only this time in the form of a timpani loop, with a few excerpts floating by. Genius.

The remaining pieces, Bjornen, Avra for Laura, and Vagn og Gunnar smoking pipes
are more of the same---why don't you try and review them when you pick up the CD.
See how far you get."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song! It explains some real life issues facing Christian men. God Bless You!
"One of the most slept on albums of the year (any genre) <SEP> ""REELEASE"" was one of the best projects I picked up in 2012.  I enjoyed it so much in fact that I bought the electronic version as well as the physical copy.  Reesa, has a frighteningly bright future if this first project is any sign of who she really is as an artist.  The project is all over the place in a good way.  And she slides back and forth between and across subject matters and melodies with the skill of a veteran artist.  ""So Easy"" is a dumb amazing track btw!  Reesa has gained an instant fan."
"Have a listen - it will leave an imprint and make you think <SEP> Reesa clearly driven to sing.  For that we should be grateful - she wraps her messages in unique beats and soundscapes.  Her songs will seep into your mind, enjoyable and thought-provoking."
"Sunnyfield Lane - To The Sun <SEP> After listening to the songs on this album/cd, Watercolours, I found myself singing this song to myself. The quietness of the music and the depth of the lyrics will catch you by surprise. I love the sound of this new indie band and can't wait to hear their next set."
"Great Mix <SEP> As someone who doesn't like dubstep, I loved this remix. Great mix of Trance and dubstep. The vocals are beautiful as you'd expect from Tritonal."
"Dubstep heaven <SEP> Tritonal is a term for a mix of 80% TNT and 20% aluminium powder with a significant explosive potential. Which is certainly what the combination of Chad Cisneros and Dave Reed have. Add singer Cristina Soto and the result is most certainly explosive. Musically, that is. The original version of ""Still With Me"" was dope enough, but the Seven Lions (aka Jeff Montalvo) remix hits it out of the ballpark. Literally. As in the ball exits Fenway Park traveling at a high velocity and lands somewhere in Sacramento.

Beautiful bass drops and monstrous levels of compression mark this song, punctuated by Cristina Soto's warbly vocals, like a wounded bird weaving her way through jagged lightning-like strobe synths and massive wicked columns of sinister sound hovering threateningly somewhere in the 20Hz range.

If this is dubstep heaven, then well, all I can say is that it is a pretty awesome place."
"powerful, more mild dub-step <SEP> Imagine a swinging pendulum,  the music seems to slow down waiting for the pendulum to pass by only for the music to speed up and then slows down again as the pendulum again swings by as if to keep the speed of the song in check.  Thats my best visual i can give you."
"NOT DJ FRIENDLY <SEP> The tracks themselves are great, but when I buy a remix album, I tend to expect the songs to have proper intros and outros, so they can be mixed with other songs without awkwardly looping parts.. This is not the case with this album, none of the remixed tracks have intros (besides, well, the intro edit of 'Lifted').  Don't buy it expecting DJ friendly formats for the remixes."
"Great song. <SEP> Great song, beautiful and sad at once...Should be on the radio."
"It would have helped if it had mentioned it was ... <SEP> It would have helped if it had mentioned it was SAMPLES, not 30 minutes of singing.  It doesn't mention samples til you have already bought it."
"Too short for the money <SEP> I wanted something I could leave playing next to my canary cage to teach him to sing. The sound is great but just about the time he gets interested, it stops. I ended up purchasing an album of canary songs in the wild. It has lots of different types of candies singing. My bird loves it!! And so do I!"
I was expecting vocals? <SEP> I really should have previewed the songs before purchasing.  They are clever piano instrumental mashups (at least the tracks that I've listened to.
"HARD HOUSE BANGEN <SEP> PHAT BEATS GALOOOOOORE
hard fast Hard house, NU NRG, everything you need for a party nothen you dont"
don't like it <SEP> very bad
Five Stars <SEP> It's great. The song played fine.
"This boy is no joke!!! <SEP> Wow, I'm having trouble finding the words to describe how much I love this young man's voice! He liked to kilt me! Crazy, mad, wonderful, make you wanna holla vocals! Ohhhhh!!!!"
"OMG this sucks! <SEP> This should not be confused with the awesome rock group Queen, this is just horrible garbage.
I listened to the preview on the Amazon web site and barely made it through.  I found this by mistake when I was
looking for Queen.  Egads it's just bad."
... first album who knew they would become such an awesome stadium filling rock band <SEP> this was the first song on led zep's first album who knew they would become such an awesome stadium filling rock band!
"Love this song <SEP> Love this song, but we have a strict no swear words policy in our house (i know...not easy) and I hate it when songs that don't swear on the radio have swearwords when I purchase them....Other songs that have been clean on the radio but have swearwords when ordered have been labeled as explicit, but this one didn't.  It took my son saying, ""Mom, why do you have a song with swear words when you won't let me""  Not cool!!"
"The orbit of occult aura <SEP> This is the ultimate in seriously obscure, occult, atmospheric black metal with a slight symphonic slant. Both bands are projects by some of the same members. Nightbringer is a bit more black metal while Temple of Not is truly dark ambient. Not for the faint of spirit. This is highly recommended for fans of Limbonic Art, Xasthur, Blood Stained Dusk, and Black Funeral. Do not listen to this alone in the dark, unless you be brave enough! \m/"
"a distorto-fest of indie cool <SEP> 11th release from San Francisco anti-pop hooligans is a distorto-fest of bizarre cut-up, jagged
  avant pop experimentation.  By turns funky, dissonant, angular, exotic, quirky, electronic,
  melodic, brash, jittery, noisy and, well...just plain bizarre, really.  That could be okay, but to me, it  feels kind of predictably ""indie-cool"".  A lot of people seem to like
  them.  I don't think I'm one of those people."
"Total garbage and scam artist <SEP> Scam artists who are pretending to be drake.  Terrible, terrible music.  I'm sure they will be sued by Drake's label."
"A Great Song! <SEP> I love this song..  touches me, however anything that he does is totally amazing, a real talent.  I would recommend any of his music."
One Star <SEP> This is another devotion hymn I use as coordinator of spiritual growth.
"The rest are horrible. Bill <SEP> I am a huge fan of the GVB, have most of their CD's and have seen them in concert three times.  However, I should have listened to all of these songs before purchasing because this CD is awful.  There are only a couple of songs that I've been able to listen to from start to finish.  The rest are horrible.  Bill, what on earth were you thinking?"
"A Must Buy.. Such a great album <SEP> I think this album is much different than their first album but, it still has that Poema sound. It seems like the music is more technical and you can hear some country and Everly brothers influences in it. They sing so good together and harmonize beautifully. They have catchy melodies; you will have the music stuck in your head. Enjoy this album and buy it now!!"
love Kathy Mattea's voice <SEP> very lovely song... love Kathy Mattea's voice.
Pure and Simple <SEP> Never a disappointment with the Gaither Group this is a great cd and I recommend it highly for all believers
"A GAWD DAMN MASTERPIECE! <SEP> This album is phenomenal!!! Heavy, fast, melodic, and just pure genius. This is punk rock music at its finest."
Five Stars <SEP> love it!
"The Wood Thrush`s Song <SEP> This is one of my favorites on Kathy Mattea's new Calling Me Home CD. It truly makes my heart sing. She has been around for a while, but continues to surprise with her music. Listen to, Hello My Name Is Coal, also on this CD,and l promise you will not be disappointed."
"I was shocked how bad this cd was <SEP> I don't believe in writing bad reviews because I never want to hurt those who have worked hard to produce the product.....but this CD was so bad that my teenagers wouldn't even listen to it.  I love comedy, and sadly this just wasn't funny.  Kyle needs to stick to motivational speaking.  I actually returned the CD....yes, it was that bad."
"Did not connect for me <SEP> I ordered this comedy cd for a long drive, along with several others; Jim Gaffigan, Aziz Ansari, Norm Macdonald, and Mike Birbiglia. Had a great drive and laughed all the way until I got to this. This seemed very juvenile and unprofessional in comparison. Like a tenth grader with tons of energy whose friends think he is hilarious, but no one else really gets. Maybe Cease is a diamond in the rough, but I would say this CD is pretty darn rough. I ordered when I saw a five star review, but now that I come back to check and see who in the world thought this deserved five stars, I see that this CD is the only review posted by most of the reviewers. Maybe it is his tenth grade pals who created Amazon accounts just so their pal could keep the laughs coming.

Update: These are probably the same folks who are rating my review (which contains nothing but one person's opinions about a comedy album) as ""unhelpful.""  :)"
"Rock-a-billy... You better believe it.... <SEP> One of the remaining ""Stray Cats"" who still plays Rock-A-Billy (Other than LEE ROCKER-former bass player)....  One listen and I was hooked; had to download it...  Damn fine tune... As to the rest of the album.. good, but not sensational..."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful Song!!
I love it! <SEP> The singer's voice is fantastic and the words are very moving.  Never thought I would like bluegrass gospel until this song.
"Fabulous <SEP> I love most songs by Blue October, and this one is beautiful as well.  If you like the style of their music, I think you'll like this song."
"Alanis Morssette's ""Incomplete"" <SEP> I love this artist very much for her depth, honesty, and vulnerability. Alanis gets better as a writer with each albumn. I am more grateful each time I listen to her work that any artist would be so brilliant, open, and clear. This song is another example of just how remarkable this artist is. Amazon.com made it so easy for me to purchase just the music I wanted by this phenominal songwriter and download it to my iPod."
Gaither Vocal Band Pure and Sample <SEP> This is one of the great and different albums. If you love southern gospel you will enjoy this great music. When it says GAITHER you will be blessed.
Very Powerful Remix <SEP> Incredible Remix. Very Strong Bass and well thoughtful Bass Line. The line before the drop is very compelling and enveloping too.
Two Stars <SEP> Not what I expected.
GREAT SONG <SEP> REMEMBER LISTENING TO THIS SONG WHEN i WAS A KID SO i DOWNLOADED IT. GREAT SONG THAT BROUGHT BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES.
Five Stars <SEP> Frank Patterson does justice to this hymn.
"Disappointed <SEP> Honestly, I get tired of Amazon not having the radio version of songs and only offering remixed or strange versions.  There was no option to purchase the album version of this song, so I bought this one quickly without testing the sample audio, and it's awful.  So, no, I'm not thrilled with it.  Lesson learned...be very careful to sample the audio before hitting the button to purchase."
"This is ""The Lush"" not ""Lush"" <SEP> Dont let Amazon fool you: This band is not ""Lush"", but ""The Lush"".
Differences: 2 different genres; female lead (Lush) -vs- male lead (The Lush)."
Five Stars <SEP> Cool music
so so <SEP> Didn't notice much of a difference.
"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! <SEP> DO NOT BUY THIS.  The Halloween sounds inserted in the music makes the music sound like a scratched record.  If I had it to do over again, I'd order just the Adams Family theme song and leave the Halloween version alone."
One Star <SEP> Song sucks
"Not the original artists <SEP> I was quite excited when I saw all these songs for such a low price. I seemed like a great deal, until I heard it. These great songs have been butchered by a bunch of nobodies. Stay far away from this!!"
"Sheesh... ""bitter"" is right... <SEP> This is the first Anouk album I have purchased after having very little exposure to her music.  I heard some songs from a live performance and was so blown away by her talent that I hurriedly bought the mp3 version of this album.  However, it is such an incredible downer and is so depressing, I can't imagine why anyone would want to put themselves through it.  I am a person that can appreciate a tortured soul and some deep subject matter, but this was just painful and unpleasant to listen to."
"loving song <SEP> this song is so heart touching its very, very, encouraging. and I love the way they play it. I listened to it a lot."
so disappointing <SEP> I am a big fan of Cat Power but ''Sun'' is not a good album at all. It is very borring and I am afraid that Miss Marshall lost her creativity (forever ?). Too bad
Five Stars <SEP> THANKS
Love Cat Power!!!! <SEP> Love this Cat power album! Very different!
"Very nice work by Cat Power <SEP> Very nice work by Cat Power, always interesting from her voice and her lyrics"
Amateur version.  NOT the actual hit song. <SEP> Don't download this.  It's a bad karaoke version and not the actual Maxine Nightingale hit version.  This listing is also deceptive as it puts in no information that you're downloading the fake version of the song.
Lolz <SEP> This song is hilarious and addicting but beware you'll get stuck listening to it for a long time like me
"Great Song <SEP> This is a funny song about the 5 Guys Burger Franchise.  Great to sing along to your significant other, a little annoying."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"Japan knows its good. <SEP> Great hard rock album, every bit as good as the first album, in fact its even better. Hard to understand why its not released worldwide."
"Officially Released...in small quantities? <SEP> What's the problem with this album? I was lucky to find a physical copy, but looks like the album is no longer available."
"Wrong label for selections <SEP> Since Toscanini did not perform this Franck symphony with the BBC Symphony, it is impossible to give this a good review.  It is a fine performance with the NBC Symphony, but the seller should indicate that it is NBC and NOT BBC that is the orchestra."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song by a pretty lady
"Must buy!! <SEP> This is such a great album! Dogwood and Holly may be a new to the music scene, but I must say they really do write fantastic music. They are a mix of Mumford & Sons, Avett Brothers, Old Crow Medicine Show, all combined with a soulful/gospel sound all their own. I would highly recommend this album."
Five Stars <SEP> good stuff
"Yes, quite. <SEP> There is simply only one word that myself, Sir Aidan Hughes can use to describe this MP3 album, and that my friends, is simply.

YYYEEEEEEAAAAAUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Good
"Good musical history, dull listening. <SEP> I am grateful for any complete version ""of record"" for our classic musicals, but this one is less than satisfying as background for a Saturday morning house cleaning. The dance and incidental music is not all that interesting, and serves to slow the rhythm and pacing of this lively show. The cast is quite fine, however, not least the born-for-stardom Megan Hilty."
"Problem <SEP> I would like to say something about the product, but I can't because I ordered it through Amazon rather than iTunes.  I could not find it on my Mac after I was advised that the download was complete.  It cost me a dollar, but rather than go through the grief of messing with where it is (there were some complicated directions to help me solve the problem that were difficult to follow) I will now order only through iTunes where I never had any difficulaties."
In my wildest dreams! <SEP> Nice...would have been great for the summer with the top down. Brandys' voice sounds as good as ever.  The beat is nice and has that grove that reminds me of the late 80's.
"From MainlyPiano <SEP> When I received ""Novella: Ukelele Mosaique"" for review, my thoughts immediately turned to Tiny Tim and Tiptoe Through the Tulips. Oh puh-leeze!!! A whole album of improvised ukelele music? Good thing I was feeling adventurous or I would have missed out on a truly unique musical experience. Guitar virtuoso Andre Feriante met master craftsman David Poplar at one of Feriantes Seattle-area guitar concerts and the two collaborated on making five different versions of the ukelele. One is a six-string model with a ukelele body and a guitar neck; there is a five-string version; a tenor four-string; a three-string ukelele that looks and sounds like an ancient Celtic instrument; and a traditional concert model. Trained as a classical guitarist from a very young age (including a stint with the legendary Andres Segovia), there is a much stronger Latin/Spanish influence in these ten improvisations (all recorded in a single night) than the Hawaiian stylings usually associated with the ukelele. The liner notes indicate which instrument was used as well as descriptions of each song. An experiment in musical storytelling, Novella is a one-of-a kind listening experience that incorporates Celtic, Spanish, Italian, Hawaiian and American blues influences that reflect Feriantes world travels and eclectic artistry.

""Novella"" begins with Rio By Night, which expresses the restful calm of the beach at the end of an adventure. Peaceful and very relaxed, its a beautiful beginning. Of Wing and Wing goes to Hawaii where exotic birds are dancing over the water. This magical piece conveys bright, sparkling water as well as the freedom of the colorful birds. Arabesque is a dark and haunting Moorish serenade played on the six-string ukelele (which sounds  more like a fine classical guitar). La Portuguesa speaks to the ukes Spanish Old World roots, and Feriantes four-string ukelele also sounds very much like a full-sized classical guitar. Blues on the ukelele? Yep! Sweet Nadine delivers with the most American-sounding song on the album. Othellos Dream is a light and gentle musical depiction of England during Shakespearean times. Eyes In the Forest is a dark minor-key exploration, much of which is played in the bass of the six-string ukelele. Free-form and haunting, it brings this fascinating album to a close.

Put aside your thoughts of what a traditional ukelele sounds like and prepare to be mesmerized by Andre Feriantes new take on this instrument. Check it out!"
half baked <SEP> Silly concept apparently decided on and then the search for content began with very few options.  Almost all  concept collections are spotty but this one is particularly so.
Foot tappin' bluegrass song <SEP> I've loved this song ever since hearing it for the first time 20 years ago at Six Flags Over Texas.
great song! <SEP> James Ward's version of Rock of Ages is so contemplative and comforting.  The tune is beautiful.  I am playing it for my mom while she is in Hospice care to share with her the sure hope of the gospel.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!!
Wasted money. <SEP> Very brief tune. Not the full song. More of a sample. Wasted money.
Love it! <SEP> I love the entire album!  She Sells The Sea is my favorite.  I hope more people give it a try.
Not what I had hoped for <SEP> The volumes vary a great deal between songs and the arrangements just aren't what I would hope for.  Live and learn
"An amazing album from Rayark's stable <SEP> Cytus -Alive- is a pretty fun listen, having such a wide range of genres that highlight the theme Rayark was going for their game. From classical to dubstep then into rock, the choice of eclectic music genres working in synthesis with one another was a fun time for me, allowing me to create a personal interpretation of the story behind the game just through the music being played in this one album alone.

Conversely, this album hints at the 10 chapter titles for Cytus.

Hopefully they will hit their lofty goal for both Android and the Apple Marketplace to unlock all 100 songs."
"A little Harmonica <SEP> More singing, less harmonica, so the title is a little misleading."
Fast Hard Punk Song <SEP> This is an old school punk style song that is about the excitement of bike racing!! Download it and help an injured racer. Lance Armstrong did!
what a rip off <SEP> i payed $1.00 and it's not the entire song??? only 45 second's of a verse wow a total rip off don't buy !!!
One Star <SEP> Is not a DVD-Audio Disk.  Just a DVD...  Not what I wanted.
"Mahler Conducted ""Nicely"" <SEP> I was very excited to listen to this performance of the Mahler 2 in remembrance to 9/11. This is a work I know well and I own about 6 other performances. The A. Gilbert performance sounds like it's conducted by a very nice man. Where Mahler calls for edge and levels of emotional intensity that push an orchestra to its limits, this performance has nothing but the very best manners. Staid and solid it is. Cadences and phrasing are so unnuanced that they sound as if they are conducted by someone who died in the era of Mozart and has been brought back to life conducting this music as if it were filtered through the lens of that time.  Yes, the orchestral playing is richly detailed and the recording is crystal clear, but this is a performance that is quickly forgotten."
"Buy it <SEP> Great voice, lyrics,and music"
so so <SEP> Not one of Steve Forberts better works. Voice sounds tired and songs rather depressing. To all of you peace out
One Star <SEP> Doesn't sound like original verison
"Brings it back <SEP> After the disappointment of Rubicon's cancellation and subsequent unavailability of an official DVD release, it was a good consolation prize. I was pleased with the track sequence and overall quality. I'd rank it up there with the work of Abigail Mead, another excellent score composer. My only quarrel is that there was a glitch on one of the tracks which I'll assume was a artifact of mastering or one-off defect of the fab. Even if you haven't seen the series this music has a ambiance and mood that is great thought provocation in the form of unobtrusive background."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome!!!
"Love it! <SEP> One of my favorite songs! Beautiful words by Woody Guthrie, beautiful harmonies by two amazing singers!"
"it was a 30 second recording. i thought the sample track was that long <SEP> Not buying music with kindle unless I have heard it on you tube or another source first.
I paid a follow-up dollar for a talking into and little singing."
"Elvis Presley - Prince From Another Planet <SEP> the DVD is poor quality but probably done by a amateur
My biggest discern is multiple long black screen blackouts , no picture just sound.
I didn't pay for a half of a DVD , probably send it back if can?
Cd's of music are good although one is the original you can buy at Walmart in the $5 Bin"
"Glen Gould's Bach Partitas - Remastered in SACD <SEP> My guess is that most listeners will have already made up their mind about Glen Gould's piano interpretations. The Partitas catch him in an analytical  mood, quite unlike any others I've heard. Fascinating, and brilliantly remastered onto SACD discs here, they may be the least warm of his Bach interpretations, but seemingly Sony would not have gone to the extra expense of issuing the two discs on SACDs unless they felt his followers have sufficiently embraced him to warrant the added cost.

Although no Bach expert, I'm more comfortable with Richard Goode's or Bernard Roberts way with these pieces, but Gould fans should be very happy with this issue."
"Another fabulous remastering job <SEP> I bought this to replace much earlier Columbia/CBS/Sony red book cds, and this is worth every penny. I have already listened to it 6 times. Gould was arguably most at home with Bach and it shows here on this album, the remastering to sacd status is stunning. For Gould fans and Bach fanatics and especially both, this is a must to add to the collection."
Stick to the original <SEP> Bad version of a great song.
Truth! <SEP> A past unknown is one of the band with truth in their music. Many bands hide the message but a past unknown doesn't care about main streaming they let the point be known. So lives can be saved and changed. God bless them.
Five Stars <SEP> ROCK!!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> This was a version for a wedding video I was creating.
"terrible, would return it if could. <SEP> hate the album, but I ordered it by mistake when I went for Book of Mormon"
"Two Stars <SEP> Unfortunately I did not like the tune, very different from the tune I know and love.  Very disappointed!"
"POOR Website <SEP> There are several versions of this song, and you cant tell 1 from the other with the extremely limited preview Amazon offers. Purchased 3 versions, and still did not get the one on the radio!  Will NOT do this again!
Rip OFF!"
"They Can't All Be Winners..... <SEP> Once in a great while a piece of work comes along that blows me away upon the first listen.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!!!  The only reason I knew of this cd is because a friend of mine downloaded it.  He thought I might like it because the drummer (as my friend puts it) is ""that dude with the hat from the Saturday Night Live Band.  That dude is Shawn Pelton.  I happen to be a huge fan of Shawn's work on SNL, but not on this outing.  None of the songs jumped out at me as immediate, heavy rotation anywhere.  These three guys try hard to make each song sound different, but it's too much sheep to pull over one eye.  If a listener likes this type of format of guitar, bass and drums, then I suggest revisiting the catalogs of The Outfield and Fastball.  Sorry guys, nothing personal.  I just have to take the ole Texas Turn-down on this one,  El Paso........"
Awesome group! <SEP> Awesome group!!!! Have heard of them for years but forgot how great they are!!! Great to see in concert too!!!
"Nona leigh <SEP> This is one of my favorite songs by Tech N9ne. I'm very content with the mp3 version of this song, which I purchased from Amazon. The sound quality is better than I expected. The sample sounded good but once downloaded to my kindle fire it sounded even better. The song is set at a reasonable price, and it's worth purchasing."
strength <SEP> this is great for any type of journey that your on.you not only hear it you feel it inside yourself.
Two Stars <SEP> Not Hank Wms Jr's best.
Great Song <SEP> A tribute to the greatest country singer who is presently making his last tour. I and country music will miss you greatly Georoge!!
"my fav <SEP> Wen I herd this song I fell in love, those that might not understand, I love freaky music, and this song is beyound freaky, I just wish Amazon would allow me to get E-40's song Funktion I want that one bad for myy MP3 please make it happen, hank Nicole."
Four Stars <SEP> i wish the songs of today contained the same lyrical passion and meaning.
"An awesome show with excellent <SEP> Heard this song on ""Roadies"" and it sent me out on a search to find the song.  An awesome show with excellent music"
"lame <SEP> Maybe I'm not a Dane Cook fan, this didn't make me laugh at all and I have a goofy sense of humor. Ben Bailey and Jim Gafigan are WAY funnier"
One Star <SEP> cannot download.
Five Stars <SEP> This was pretty heavy. I like heavy.
Great  <SEP> Great music! On time just as stated..thank you
skips <SEP> This product came to me have a few skips in it and again I do not now how to return it so with these issues not sure that I am going to be ordering anything else in the future
Not very funny <SEP> I have heard Jeanne Robertson on the radio and every single one of her shows were hilarious.  This CD did not cover anything I have heard on the radio and I know why.  She is more on the serious side of issues and not really funny.  I was going to send this to my parents to listen to but I don't think they would find it very entertaining.  I am disappointed and wish I could send this back.
2 stars <SEP> 3 good songs in the entire album. recommend buying song you like. This band has the potential of being real good band.
Five Stars <SEP> I like this version the best
One Star <SEP> Never ordered this!  What is it?
One Star <SEP> I never ordered this!
hate this song <SEP> all of jason's songs are like this. this song and all of his others are high-pitched and annoying. I don't recommend this song to anyone!
don't like it <SEP> i chose this rating because it gets boring after so long. all of his songs are like that. i don't recommend this product!
So much fun! <SEP> Great album Mac Powell!!  So much fun to listen to!  MISSISSIPPI is my favorite!
One Star <SEP> I don' do reviews
"An amazing and uplifting collection of Gospel Music <SEP> This CD is sure to lift your spirits, encourage your heart.....the collection of songs coupled with Bishop Flunder's vocal gifts are an blessing!  I listen to the CD everyday."
"It was a very touching inside me. <SEP> Well I like great jazz and Freddie use to be one of the best.
great trumpet just like a saxophone can really move your soul
and make you dream like you are somewhere else....it took me
to another universe....that is why I like that song."
Four Stars <SEP> Sexy
"Five Stars <SEP> I LOVE IT, ORIGINAL RECORDINGS, VERY HARD TO FIND RELEASE, I RECOMMEND IT."
"Not upto the mark :( <SEP> I'm a long-time fan of Dr LS, but this is the first album I find missing the mark. I wish I did not purchase this album. This feels like cheap religious music with haphazard sound tracks mixed together. Sorry!"
"Homogenous Beats, Not Mixed Together. Meh <SEP> Songs are a little dated, but I knew that from the track list. However, they all sound the same and worse, they are NOT MIXED TOGETHER! Big fail."
"His voice is simply amazing!! <SEP> This is a beautiful ""sad"" song! Can a song be beautiful yet sad?? It's really deep/thought provoking. Absolutely love it!"
One Star <SEP> would like to hear the sample clip -- it is not audible
Four Stars <SEP> Love this song!
One Star <SEP> Tasteless album. Request refund on item.
"If you came here looking for Gangnam Style, you're out of luck <SEP> instead you've found some terrible music that someone named Gangnam Style in hopes of cashing in on people too dumb to realize that it's the wrong song when they buy it..."
BadAzz <SEP> @#$%! Son of Link Wray on Mars.  Les Paul called and said come plug in kid.  Like jumping from Outer Space.
Five Stars <SEP> Another great album from Bucky love it
dissapointed <SEP> Was unable to get it to work properly so hopefully others have better luck- not sure what the issue was
Great Idea. Bad Product. <SEP> Don't waste your time or money. You will rrturn it. Instantly fogs up with excessive amounts of moisture. I bought two(myself and my son) we both had the same problem.
"Rare gem of a recording <SEP> Gorgeous recording from a 1976 studio date in Denmark on the Steeplechase label! It features a trio that is at the top of their game:  swingin' Horace Parlan on piano with in the pocket NHOP on bass and an able assist byTony Inzalaco on drums. A finger snapping intro with No Blues, a harmonically lush rendition of My Foolish Heart, and a burning Have You Met Miss Jones start things off nicely. This is a rare treat and one you'll be very happy to add to your collection if you are a jazz lover. I'll avoid commenting about each track and let you the listeners decide for yourselves just suffice it to say that every track is a winner!  This review wouldn't wouldn't be complete; however, without mentioning the superb quality of the recording. I do hope more people will discover it and help it garner more rave reviews, which it surely deserves."
Art at its best <SEP> Both the painting and the rendering of this  song is perfection of the ideals of mankind and our questions of why? what does it mean?
"NIN Fan of Old <SEP> Great quality rip of the song. Had the album but lost it, thank goodness for this option. All the minor background audio is there. Real good."
great <SEP> great
#PrayforRain <SEP> PE: AO
Nat Turner <SEP> Breakneck snare & booming vocals make for classic hip-hop.
Five Stars <SEP> fun song with a throw-back disco sound!
La Sangre <SEP> This hits the heart and makes become aware of what life is really all about and makes realize that your ancestry continues and continues forever with your roots (Sanger).
"AWESOME SONG <SEP> FOR ALL OF YOU BILLY STEWART FANS---THIS SONG IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY. I HAVE NEARLY ALL OF HIS SONGS ON MY IPOD. HE WAS A GREAT SINGER WHO IS GREATLY MISSED. LOVE YOU ""BROTHER BILLY""!!"
"Five Stars <SEP> Nicely done...reminds me of dreamy, chill, jazz lounge music. If you like Thievery Corporation or st. Jermaine you'll love this!!!!!"

Two Stars <SEP> Did not like the song lyrics. Beat is good.
Five Stars <SEP> Great singer
"An Angel Gets Its Wings <SEP> If you like the movie, It's A Wonderful Life, you'll really enjoy this song.  Trisha Yearwood and Vince Gill do an awesome job. Love the song!  It's very upbeat!"
#_________ <SEP> Exhultant #instrumental.  Very lively.
One Star <SEP> Not a huge fan
"This is NOT REM - go to iTunes to find the real REM song <SEP> This is NOT REM but a midi-driven imitation of the song by ""Shiny Happy People"".  I was looking for the REM song and got suckered in thinking this was the original.  Don't buy this.  It's crap!"
One Star <SEP> Not as good as the original
ok <SEP> Not near as good as Nitty Gritty Dirt Band They need to punch it up a bit then maybe they might be there
"One Star <SEP> I thought they were heavy, nope. Kick the girl out of the band and stop being wimps."
"Greatest unrecorded artist, but they did have tape recorders, eh? <SEP> One of the most fulfilling experiences is sitting and listening to a great organist play a great organ. In fact a great organist like Hal Shutz can even make a little Hammond Chord organ sound amazing. Every mood, and I mean every mood, can be portrayed through the organ. This is why if someone says they hate organ music it means they are one of two things- impatient or tone deaf. These days people are more impatient than ever. I recommend everyone take just two weeks spending just 1 hour each of those days and pick out a selection of organ music. I guarantee that after those two weeks you will be a big fan of Jesse Crawford, or Walter Wanderley, or George Wright, or Ann Leaf, or Eddie Layton, or Klaus Wunderlich, or Reginald Dixon, or Horace Finch, or Lenny Dee, or Jimmy Smith, or Ethel Smith, or John Winters , or Paul Mickelson, or Don Baker, or Bob Ralston...and the list goes on and on.
The great electronic organ from 1935 the early 70's are the best models to seek out for a second hand model ( much better than digital). The Hammond Chord organ model S-6 that you hear on this Hal Shutz record is smaller and easy to manage in any home or apartment, at 140 pounds. I can assure you though that the 3rd song on the record is not a Chord organ unless he did a few overdubs or multiple tracks and mixed together, but you never know with a remarkable musician like Hal Shutz, it just might be the Chord organ at that."
i vioded this song off. <SEP> I want my movies to be very special to show I did not come  a royalty family  I just  but a godly family. Be thing was not music I was look for.
just ok <SEP> This band is OK you no way are they as good as Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. I don't think any band could do The Dirt Band justice.
"purchased this song, got billed for the song and ... <SEP> purchased this song, got billed for the song and for whatever reason son was not transferred to my music library."
best of kelly <SEP> loooooooooooove this song love the album cover love ms.kelly. great  joint and great video as well. i wish the best for kellly rowland.t his is her prime
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorites!
One Star <SEP> Was very disappointed brought this cd for 1 song and its half of the song.
Two Stars <SEP> It was just ok.
"A Classic Country Song. <SEP> With Travis and Marty, you have a classic country song. They duo so well together. Their energy makes country music a must listen."
what the heck are the songs that are on the lb <SEP> seems every time I look for a certain song. if it is on lp form you don't list the songs that are on the lp or the cds... how can I know if this is the lp  or cd I am looking for
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome Stepping Track !
One Star <SEP> I didn' realize it was instrumental.
Five Stars <SEP> Great soothing ambiance.
"I did not like this album at all <SEP> I did not like this album at all.  I was expecting it to be like Amy's other Christmas albums, but it was very different, and in my opinion, very inferior to the previous ones."
"GO BUY REAL UNDERGROUND POSITIVE TRUTH MUSIC 4 DA YOUTH & ADULTS"" <SEP> BUT IT SUPPORT SUPPORT BUY IT SUPPORT BUY IT GO BUY ALL IMMORTAL TECHNIQUES ALBUMS & SINGLES YOU READ MAN  PEACE !!"
"This is a different song. <SEP> There are several tracks labeled ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" by Ann Sothern but some of them are actually ""You'll Never Know."" Both are from LADY BE GOOD. If the song is about 4:40 in length, it's ""The Last Time I Saw Paris."" If it's much shorter and in the preview you can hear Sothern singing ""you'll never know,"" it's ""You'll Never Know."""
"Very disappointing sample <SEP> This is an extremely disappointing sample, since only the long-forgotten verse of ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" is included. Not even one note of the familiar refrain is present."
Fan for Life. <SEP> Beautiful voice.  Beautiful song.  She is an amazingly talented artist.  She is so underrated.  She is just naturally talented. Team Tamia.
"One Star <SEP> Awesome band. They have some great albums. This, however, is not one of them. Very disappointing."
"The Greatest Lament for June 1940 I have heard <SEP> When Paris fell in June of 1940, the world shook and mourned as it had for no other city. Oscar Hammerstein wrote a poem about the Paris he loved to console himself and Jerome Kern set it to music. Ann Sothern's  performance of the resulting song, ""The Last Time I Saw Paris,"" is the finest I have ever heard. By the way, the song is mis-identified as ""You'll Never Know."" If you believe that is the title, you'll never know what you're missing."
"Horrible <SEP> What content is there? I don't know, because the recording quality sounds like a 1930s radio program, the reader's voice has an accent that is too strong for my American ears to follow easily, and the content I did slosh through is so boring.

For the first 30 minutes, the ""legendary"" singer does nothing but complain about how little everyone else knows about singing! She is really bitter, and I feel like I've wasted my life listening to her. I'll probably never force myself to listen to the rest, if she even gets to talking about how to actually sing better."
Five Stars <SEP> GREAT SONG!!!!
"Giants is awesome! Music is very well made. <SEP> I love the series of games of skylanders. When I am not playing the game I love listening to the epic music. Yeah this one is the second game, but there are some awesome music even on the second one. If you love the music from Giants, which  I know I do, it will be a great one to pick up. :3"
so mean <SEP> Doesn't have any of the best tracks from the game. Come on this is the 21st century.  Why are Activision so mean.  If you buy this you are not getting even a quarter of the music from the game.  Look at YouTube skylandergiantsmusicc channel to see what you are missing.
"Skylander-Giants Has A Fantastical Adventure Musical Motif! <SEP> MUSIC REVIEW # 37 Skylander's Giants

If you are a player of video games and especially love the adventure ones, you probably don't pay too much detailed attention to the music in the background. But just like its original, Skylanders-Giants has a score that actually stimulates your adventures to a magical toe-tapping orchestral rhythm.

Scottish composer and Grammy Award winning Lorne Balfe who has composed the background scores for such games as Rango, Crysis 2, Assassins Creed Revelations and the original Skylanders- Spyro's Adventures has achieved an even more energetic and `feel-good' score for Skylander- Giants. His other credits include producing such scores as Sherlock Holmes and Inception.

Your mission is to find treasures, special hats and defeat the all-evil KAOS in dozens of lands. As each section of the adventure unfolds the orchestral accompaniment of Balfe's score sends you running, battling or into very mysterious areas and you are cautiously searching your way through each colorful adventure. Lorne Balfe does an amazing job at bringing fun, fancy and magicality into an extremely melodi yet vibrant soundtrack.

Track by track: From the opening cue called `Giants' that swings with passion and power and the rush of a grand adventure of fun and magic. `Junkyard Isles' has the fanciful rhythms and beats that make you want to dance with almost a Keltic swing. `Rumbletown' has the sweet sting of a marching and mysterious rhythm that makes the mind think, `look before you leap!'

Now, `Cutthroat Carnival' has the fancy fair of a darker and yet perkier tone that will make you swing in rhythm to the beat. I enjoy the string arrangements on this one and the underscoring of the brass and tympani. `Glacier Gully' has an almost ethereal quality to it and it again uses the beauty of the string to convey it wonderment and yes majesty of its passion.

Danger seems to be eminent in the cue `The Secret Vault of Secrets'. It moves fast and deep with an accompaniment that makes you want to rush through your adventure. That wisp of magic still in the air. `The Oracle' is exactly what it says. It is short but amazing. `Wilkin Village' has a friendly family feel to its rhythm and I can imagine playing the game and being surprised once again by the colors and characters I see and I can imagine this in my head just listening to this grand piece of music.

`Ariel Attack'. Is a proud piece of music that is rhythmic and foreboding with a hint of humor and amazing play of melodies. `Drill X's Big Rig' is more electronic and whipping in nature and obviously gives the emotion of size and danger. `Molkin Mountain' is another forceful and proud cue that has the same proud rhythms as before but in more brash and bold tones. `Arena Battle' is exactly that a march and collection of battle-sounding drums and percussion that leave you to believe the battle is here and you are right in the middle of it.

Closing out the soundtrack are the cues `Auto Gyro Adventure' which starts slow and then again takes its strings and percussion to a level that implies magic, wonder and amazement. `Slippery Tunnel' is soft and subtle at first and then rhythms of percussion swiftly glide you to an incredible melody of music that makes this my second favorite cue of the score. I found myself humming this one even after I stopped listening to it.

Lastly the cut `Bringing Order To Kaos' closed the soundtrack with a low toned base filled choral sounding chant that slowly builds and climbs in rhythm. Then its done. It's all over. The end. Bummer.

I really loved this score and each cut, for me was way too short. For soundtrack collectors and fans of Lorne, this is a must to have. Yes, I have played Skylanders and I remember when first playing it I said aloud, this score would be great soundtrack to have. It's here. It's bold and fun and very magical in its emotion and deserves to be listened all on its own."
"Nice song! <SEP> Musiq always delivers something catchy, rhythmic and soulful. This is no different. The vest is nice too. He's great live as well."
"Straight From the LP..Hiss, Skips & All... <SEP> I was excited to see this available as a MP3 download, but its directly from an album-not master tapes or anything slightly advanced. Track # 13 (That feeling for Home) has a skip in it!"
Same Newsome! <SEP> Sam Newsome is incredible! Please check this album out and support someone who is making such creative music. You will not be disappointed.
AS GOOD VAS IT GETS <SEP> One of the BEST ROCK AND ROLL of all TIME!!!!!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> TV PARTY!!!
Ruuuuuun! Don't do it! <SEP> Don't order from this company. The size is horrible. I ordered and xl and my coat for likes an extra small. The fabric was very raggedy. Very bad. I would never order from then again! And you're made to give them a dam star in order to leave your review. I don't want to give then a star!
"Just doesn't have the spark <SEP> I really gave this one a try, playing it through several times, but ended up deleting it from my computer. There's just no life or personality in it at all. May be OK as background music, but a disappointment if you're actually paying attention and listening to it."
Whoa. <SEP> Mustve been their first cd. It only had 4 good songs. In total and that is not a lot for a total of ten.
Robert kitchen <SEP> Looking for the original version this one sucksi
"Wow! <SEP> The Choir of Clare College positively nails this wonderful little motet. It's a setting of the Latin Christmas text, ""Christ Is Born Today."" The performance is appropriately light and airy; the intonation is flawless."
Five Stars <SEP> Great value and quick shipping time.
"Watch your baby <SEP> My baby (not even three months old) while kicking his feet with joy managed to ""walk"" the app on my phone through the purchase of this song.  I couldn't believe that there was no confirmation (or maybe the baby confirmed too!) before purchase was finalized.  I only lost a $1, so I won't complain too much.  Amazon should check into this."
Five Stars <SEP> Motivational music
"The Picks. <SEP> Potential purchasers might like to know that the two Buddy Holly discs in this otherwise satisfactory collection are (once again) overdubbed versions, featuring the Picks.
Holly collectors will know the significance of this sad fact."
"A Dark Little Christmas-Time Star <SEP> I was really quite surprised by this one. The driving, insisting beat of Jingle Bells is quite a departure from the traditional arrangement and brings to mind Gene Krupa on drums and the fiery swing numbers of the Benny Goodman Orchestra. Silent Night is a whole different kettle of fish, though. The lyrics have been replaced with the Hans Christian Andersen story of the Little Match Seller Girl who gazes into the window of a happy family having their Christmas dinner while she slowly freezes to death on the pavement. Dark! The Sisters singing is so beautiful and soothing over the familiar arrangement of Silent Night that you don't notice them singing 'the little girl sleeps in the snow' until the second listen. Imagine Christmas round Nick Cave's house."
"Such a deep, powerful song <SEP> For being a bonus track as well as a cover, Keith does an amazing job with this song.  It is so heartfelt and emotional while there is still a level of control and understanding in his singing.  Love this song, definitely one of his best!"
Great contrast! <SEP> I love the contrast of this cut compared to some of the others. Never thought these two could have such a good time doing country!
"Be warned - you'll hear only one note. <SEP> Yep that's right ; $0.99 for one note. The other 2 bagatelles (and the optional 4th bagatelle encore) have zero notes.  What's next, an MP3 of John Cage's 4'33 of Silence? C'mon!"
What Could Have Been love <SEP> Great song - Aerosmith never lets me down.  Thanks Steve.  I miss you on AI but prefer to hear the group out there doing what they do - beautiful music.  It was a fun time for AI but you need to go do what you do best.
my acct <SEP> i order this acct a couple days ago and the money was draft out of my acct your draft money again today what the for
"What a BLESSING!! <SEP> I didn't think I would like any other songs better than Abgiail Miller's I Can Go In CD, but this CD spoke to me on a deeper personal level.

I set my CD alarm clock to wake me with Nothing is too Precious.

When my little girls & I are cleaning up the kitchen together or in different parts of the house during our ""weekly clean-up hour"", we listen to Washing the Feet of my Family.

When my soul needs refreshing:  Don't Doubt in the Dark, One Look in His Eyes, It's Such a Privilege, Rend Your Heart, I Cast My Care, Lord, I bring My Heart, & The Love of God.

When I think of God's promises to His people & my responsibilities:  Give Me a Vision, It's Such a Privilege, Speak Love, & America, Bless God.

When I am dealing with a stronghold or having doubts: Deliverance & My Name is Written on His Hands.

We love it !!  Listen & Be blessed!!"
I am disappointed. <SEP> The CD was listed under music.  It is not music.  She calls it performance poetry.  It is not poetry in any sense of the word.  It is not what I thought I was buying.  I am disappointed.
"Easy on the ears <SEP> Love his music!  Very unique, easy listening and creative!"
Love It <SEP> Great music by a gifted musician and a genuinely caring man.
"Love it. <SEP> Matthew West, that says it all. Love it."
"Best musical <SEP> Just a fantastic musical, a rollercoaster ride of life and emotions
A true Yorkshire las whom put Castelford on the map."
"Missing tracks <SEP> The track list shows 16 tracks including my all-time favorite Christmas song ""The Secret of Christmas.""  The CD I received has the same cover but only 13 tracks.  One of the missing tracks is ""The Secret of Christmas.""  I honestly bought this CD for that one song and it's not there."
"Remixes at their finest <SEP> This album only has three songs, but you would never know it because the remixes were so artfully done that they sound like five completely different mixes.  What's more, this album is actually very pretty to listen too.  Truly a masterpiece of sound."
"Incredible dark ambient journey <SEP> Bannwald has quickly become one of my favorite albums of darker music.  I am a fan of most Apoptose albums anyways, but this one really is something special.  A definite must have."
Great Child's Song <SEP> My kids love this song!!  The whole family gets involved when we play this song.  I recommend for anyone with little ones.
Love the Moose <SEP> We love this song and always play it when we are on the go. It is fun for kids and adults alike.
"Awesome <SEP> I don't know who likes it more, my kids or me! This is a very catchy song. You'll love it!"
I like it better live tho <SEP> Have it in repeat. I like it better live tho
"The best Manowar album since 1992's THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL <SEP> Released in 2012, THE LORD OF STEEL is the 12th studio album by American power metal pioneers Manowar, who formed in 1980 and released their debut two years later. As such, THE LORD OF STEEL came out thirty years after their first release. Whiners love to complain about the supposedly bad bass-heavy production, but in my opinion this is the best Manowar album since 1992's THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL and arguably their first four albums from 1982-1984. In fact, it reminds me of that early era and is comparable.

While FIGHTING THE WOLRD (1987), KINGS OF METAL (1988) and THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL were decent and had their high points, LOUDER THAN HELL (1996) increased the cheese factor with the additions of orchestrations. Manowar upped the ante toward sappy symphonic epics in the 2000s with WARRIORS OF THE WORLD (2002) and GODS OF WAR (2007).

With THE LORD OF STEEL they rightly strip everything down for an actual metal album, which has several highlights: The excellent ballad Righteous Glory, which has hints of Queensryches The Lady Wore Black, the Eagles Hotel California and Bathorys  Song to Hall Up High. Then theres the great unconventional doom of Black List (unconventional in a structural sense) immediately followed by the catchy and heavy Expendable, which was probably inspired by The Expendables movie franchise and shouldve been used for the soundtrack of one of those films. The last song, The Kingdom of Steel, is also a highlight and epic. All the rest of the songs are listenable with Touch the Sky and El Gringo standing out, the latter seemingly an homage to Ennio Morricones scores to spaghetti Westerns. Manowarriors is a catchy anthem to Manowar fans and the speedy title track is a decent choice to open the album. Heck, even ""Annihilation"" and ""Hail, Kill and Die"" are memorable. ""Born in a Grave"" is also quite good despite some insipid lyrics. In case you didn't notice, I just named every song on the album, which explains my high rating.

Speaking of the lyrics, they're generally one-dimensional and cheesy in the manner of a lot of Manowar lyrics, but they're true to the bands comic booky Warrior Metal/Viking Metal theme. What else is new? These guys are professionals and they well know their lyrics are equal parts over-the-top, fun and comical. Listen, for instance, to ""Pleasure Slave"" and try NOT busting out laughing. Anyone who takes such lyrics seriously needs to visit the psyche ward. That said, they DO have some songs with interesting and evocative lyrics, like ""Guyana (Cult of the Damned),"" ""Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts"" and ""Spirit Horse of the Cherokee."" Let's give credit where credit's due.  As for the production, I don't see the problem. The bass is prominent, but thats nothing new with bassist Joey DeMaio as the bandleader. This is just an all-around enjoyable modern release from Manowar. I'm glad they moved away from the dull, maudlin orchestrational crapola.

GRADE: A-"
"and done so much better (Kings of Metal <SEP> In an attempt to lay down a severely HEAVY sound, Joey DeMaio's production sabotages this album and renders it curiously soft and padded in every department. Not to mention that the man's songwriting has plummeted severely over the past 15 years. We've heard all of this before, and done so much better (Kings of Metal, Triumph of Steeland those glorious first four albums). Ninety-percent of Eric Adams' delivery is that talk-singing thing he's been doing more and more each album. Overall, this is a self-neutered Manowar. The only song that impressed this longtime Manofan is ""Black List."" So it sits on my CD shelf forever next to the band's formidable catalog, but will be listened to neveror rarely."
"... bits of the songs and thinks it will be great. Then you learn that the singer makes the ... <SEP> So you buy the album listening to bits of the songs and thinks it will be great.
Then you learn that the singer makes the crowd sing the entire time making hard to follow the lyrics.
I regret buying this album.

Don't recommend it!"
Memories of Germany <SEP> I learned all these beautiful songs while teaching in a nursery  in Frankfurt Germany.  such memories are precious at any age.
"""Maybe I'm Amazed (arr. for chorus)"" at a length of 5 ... <SEP> This says, ""Maybe I'm Amazed (arr. for chorus)"" at a length of 5 1/2 minutes. There are no voices -- it's nothing but 5 1/2 minutes of solo piano."
SOPHIA <SEP> LOVE THIS SONG.  I HAD SOME OF HIS MUSIC ALREADY IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC YOU WILL LOVE JEFF FLOYD
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful!! Brings great joy and enjoyment!
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
"I Don't Recall is relatable. <SEP> Good peaceful, relaxing and makes a lot of sense. I ""Don't Recall works for me on so many levels"" and relatable. Was glad to gotten it.  {;-])"
disappointed <SEP> I was disappointed in the quality of this recording. The background instrument to the pan flute was distracting. Not what I was expecting.
"Great new singer <SEP> He has joined a famous Christian female singer and the duo will be touring the country in September, I heard.  First stop will be Disney World.

This guy is on the move!"
Five Stars <SEP> These three gentlemen are amazing!
"Five Stars <SEP> Been a fan of TM for years, haven't lost a step at all."
"A Must-Have CD! <SEP> For those of us who have too many jazz CDs to even keep track of, it's rare to find a one which is completely new and refreshing.  That's what ""Being in Love"" is.  Amikaeyla's clear and lilting voice with her unique interpretations and personal expressions is a complete joy to listen to.  Everything about this album is well-crafted; the artists and musicians, the diverse and colorful selections themselves, and the presentation of the pieces make this CD a must-have for your collection."
"WOW! <SEP> I LOVE this album! Yes, the backup is stellar, the arrangements kickass, the songs unbelievable. But honestly, I would listen to Amikaeyla anywhere, anytime, with lots or a little behind her. She just plain is my favorite vocalist and this album is pure her, plus! Thanks for the beauty!!!!!"
"one of their best <SEP> hello,
  there are a million groups that have interesting songs and music.  i was searching for a moody song, but still remain happy.  this song does both.  it sounds eerie and the words makes one think about a lot of stuff.  but, the melody is so that you remain happy singing along or just listening.  it is not as upbeat as light my way, but it is good."
nope <SEP> I never listened to this and accidentally downloaded it with a bunch of other songs. So I can't really give an effective review
"Should have been more sucessful !!!! <SEP> I had a few of her songs on some of my DJ cd's and they were good , but never gave much thought to her entire album. I was pleasantly surprised when I got $5 mp3 from Amazon. Very enjoyable listen."
Bleach Re-master <SEP> The first Nirvana hit and still one of their best songs.
"Could be MUCH Better! <SEP> While I enjoy MOST of these songs, I am really disappointed in how this collection is put together.  Not only do you find you get two or three mixes of the SAME song here several times, but for some reason they decided to put some of them back to back!  So you find yourself have to skip forward if you don't want to hear the same song with a different remix. They couldn't even shuffle them?!

Wow. Well intentioned but someone wasn't thinking when they put this album together.  Sad."
Pretty face... <SEP> I was a fan of a few of her songs but this album is all about her pretty face.  The music is crap.
"FANTASTIC FANTASTIC <SEP> Kristine W has done it again her own creative camp style music.
There is no sound like Kristine W well there is no voice like hers.
Each song is catchy and disco dance, you won't be able to sit in your seat.
This is a great new album that she has released.
All the disco dance lovers I recomend this to you."
"Sounthern Soul at its Best"" <SEP> Jeff Flody is one of my favorite SouthernSoul Singers. Great CD!!"
"Discs are low quality <SEP> Songs on discs are not clear or crisp, you can listen to them but not good quality, would not order again from seller."
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
"Tommy has a great voice and writes most of his own music <SEP> Tommy has a great voice and writes most of his own music. His later cd's are MUCH better than this one so don't turn your back on him.  I didn't like the calypso mode of the cd. The beach music was good. Overall if I heard it before, I would have never bought it."
"Great Drumming By One of the Greats! <SEP> This is one of the best solos by the great Joe Morello! I've never heard him play as clean, with so much energy... he definitely gave his best on their last tour!"
"Just Plain Unsatisfied <SEP> Don't get me wrong.  I like Nine Days, but I didn't like this album.  I'm not sure what happened between 2000 when they made ""Madding Crowd"" and 2002, when they made this.  With Madding Crowd, I liked ten out of twelve songs.  With this, it's one out of 12 - ""I Feel Fine"" was pretty good.  I couldn't stand the other ones (cheesy rhymes, bad tempo, bad lyrics, 'Won't let you dowwahowahaowwwwn...' in ""Everything"")."
"If you appreciate truly great music, you will love this cd <SEP> Due to problems with Sony, Ninedays were never able to release this album, which is a great shame.  12 beautifully crafted songs are locked up, unable to be released. However, these songs are available for download along with all of Ninedays independant albums from [...]
With faster, catchy, true and beautiful songs such as 'favourite song', 'emily', 'marvelous', and 'the joneses', this album is sure to put you in a great mood. It is balanced with slower balads with beautiful melodies, lyrics and music, like 'i feel fine', the irrestistable 'ocean', 'everything', 'beautiful', and 'great divide'. Until you've at least listened to this collection of great songs, you will not appreciate truly great music. Listen to the downloads, Ninedays have freely invited people to download these songs, and you shall find yourself in love with this band."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this CD!!!!
"I love this song <SEP> The lyrics of this song bring back some hard memories for my husband, but it's Johnny's heartfelt singing that keeps me listening to it."
Great to hear <SEP> Great to hear while driving on the road.
"At least I........... <SEP> Good old Roy Clark song. Cash is far ""edgier, grittier"" and believable. If your looking for vocal purity and or smoothness, go buy some Perry Como or Jim Reeves; but if you want sweaty, smelly, real feelings, this may satisfy."
a must have <SEP> this song speaks to my soul and is a must have.
Five Stars <SEP> Great for listening to while exercising.
"Great tune! <SEP> Fabulous music, especially for 99 cents for it being such a long track.
A friend turned me onto her and I can't stop listening.
Worth every penny!"
"Downloaded MP3 <SEP> Downloaded mp3 with no problems, love the Black Crowes.  Great to buy from, easy download, what more can I say?"
Excellent <SEP> The beat pulls you in.  The guitars are merciless.  The vocals stitch together the perfect canvas in which to escape.
Just had to own it. <SEP> Just like this song
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Five Stars <SEP> This is one of my favorite songs period.  Highly recommend.
Five Stars <SEP> Luv it

"it was the wrong version of the song  not what was playing on Pandora <SEP> the song I was listening to was the original version by Johnny Cash .The song which was down loaded was the corrupted version

Love this song!! <SEP> Their whole album is amazing and after buying this song I made the choice to buy the CD as well!!
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"Love all Imagine Dragons stuff! <SEP> One of my favorite new ones on this album!  The lyrics are so sweet, and I love that they write their own stuff."
Burned cd <SEP> This was a burned cd that did not even play in my.cd player. Should.not even.get a star
Two Stars <SEP> song
"Review of ""It's Time"" by Imagine Dragon <SEP> A modern rock song with lyrics and rhythm that are little bit different but very good.  Well-done vocals and instrumentation."
Five Stars <SEP> I love this album
Five Stars <SEP> love it!
Very dull & tired <SEP> Good for a listen or two but quickly became bored with it and took it out of rotation! Too bad as I was looking forward to it...
"No oboe? <SEP> This is a re-recorded or re-mixed version, not the original from the '80s.  It's still a wonderful song, but the instrumental arrangement is not as haunting as the original."
"Olsen is an amazing singer/songwriter, a phrase that I hate but, alas, is what she is. <SEP> Newcomers should start with the stunning ""Burn Your Fire For No Witness"" and then buy this album because it's really good.

If you like great music you're in luck, here it is."
"First let me say that I love Angel Olsen <SEP> First let me say that I love Angel Olsen. Burn Your Fire For No Witness is a great album. Unfortunately Half Way Home is rather painful. Although Ms. Olsen demonstrates her tremendous vocal ability on every song, the choice of material here is poor. Acrobat is in particular excruciating. Listen before you buy!"
Great Song on a Great Album <SEP> Love this song amazing! Really powerful and emotionally stirring. Great to listen to inspire you and get you pumped up.
"Crowes at their best! <SEP> Fantastic song! I love everything that The Black Crowes has accomplished, but this song is out of this world. Rock-n-roll, blues, funk with a twist of gospel. You will not be disappointed with this one!"
Great song terrible recording <SEP> Great song but whoever mastered this needs to be fired. It's staticy thru the whole song.
One Star <SEP> Doesn't play in Amazon Music.

",Nice product - worth the money. <SEP> ,Nice product - worth the money."
Old but good <SEP> Enjoyed this album
"AM Radio Version of ""Get Ready""...Do not Buy! <SEP> This CD is like a cut up AM radio version of Rare Earth. Get Ready is chopped up to less than three minutes. ..... Plus the other songs on the CD are the lamest Rare Earth I have ever heard.

Do not buy this."
"Four Stars <SEP> Love this song,that opening guitar riff is a real classic!"
"excellent album! <SEP> Oh goodness I love this album!!! I loved Erin's first album, but I love this one even more! More people should know about this wonderful artist!"
"Great lovely CD <SEP> I LOVE this CD! It's very poppy, great music to listen to when exercising or just in the mood for something bouncy! I love this singer and I think she should be more well known! She's sadly one of those singers that are just shoved int othe lime light :( Sad really! :( Thank you Pandora radio, however for having me discover her :)"
"great <SEP> its just a really good song, sung by Mr. Cash, who sings it beautifully, I highly recommend the song to everybody who loves Johnny Cash or some spiritual music."
Five Stars <SEP> SLAYER
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song!!! One of my favorites!!
Not what I expected! <SEP> Expected to hear music not just lyrics.  Very disappointed in this purchase.  Deleted it from my device & the cloud.
"Another Great Rare Earth Jam <SEP> I believe that this cut originally came from the album Willie Remembers.  It has a good beat and is a good time song.  Since a number of Rare Earth albums are not available any more, I am very happy that we can download MP3's of the tunes that we grew up with."
"Skip It <SEP> This is a blanket review of ALL Murrman Remix songs on this CD; they basically don't live up to the original track.

I want to say they're the equivalent of a House or Dance remix, but they *ARE* better than that, but they're NOT really anything more than that.

The bass is overly saturated, and it doesn't match the song; most remixed tracks on this CD could have been easily enhanced by someone that knows how to remix (like NIN remixes).  You're left with this odd, 'I could have done better' feeling with the track.

If you listen to them in-order on the CD, you'll be skipping to the next track by the last song, even if you're REALLY trying to give it a chance. Again, none of them are terrible by their own right, but they are just not better or even different, in a better way, than the original song."
"All about Arthur <SEP> Chances are if you're interested in this soundtrack it's to relive the ""Keep the Lights On"" movie experience, but if you're new to the music of Arthur Russell this isn't a bad place to start.  The movie's often bleak emotional landscape found a strange yet oddly fitting musical bedfellow in Russell. It seemed clear to me that the director approached the movie with this music in mind. I'm withholding one star for the strange omission of ""This Is How We Walk on the Moon"", featured so prominently in the film but missing here. Probably a rights issue, but a bummer nonetheless."
"Scotty and the band are back with a ""BANG"" <SEP> Saw this band recenty and they did some songs from this album, and this one was my favorite. It has a funky old ragtime band sound to it."
Five Stars <SEP> Soft righteous harmony done to perfection.
... let your grandkids get into your passwords this is horrible music. <SEP> this is his grandma rating this don't let your grandkids get into your passwords this is horrible music.
"60% of a great song <SEP> I like the song.  However, this particular file ends abruptly somewhere in the middle of the banjo solo.  Not quite sure why such a product would be of interest to any music lover.  My recommendation: buy another version of the song, or better yet, ask the seller to fix it, remove it, or advertise clearly that this is only a song fragment, of little value to anybody."
One Star <SEP> wish you had a zero
"What's not to like? It's Mozart <SEP> What's not to like? It's Mozart! Uchida does a superb job with two very different piano concerti. Even though I already had Concerto 21, I bought this CD to get #9."
"Unique Interpretation on the old 21 <SEP> There are so many versions of piano concerto no21 that I almost didn't bother getting it. It was the high ratings and reviews that tipped me over. If you're a fan of concerto 21 then I highly doubt you'll regret adding this to your collection. There will always be some purest or someone with some crazy high standards that will hate on this. They even might want to strangle me with a piano string at this very moment. I just hope they do it while I'm listening to this album; would be a cool way to enter into heaven.  Don't listen to the h8ter$. If you like the 21, then you should treat-yo-self and buy it."
Five Stars <SEP> Very nice music!
Best going to Heaven song in the 70s <SEP> One of the best songs of the 70s it's all about Jesus and going to heaven in a rock and roll format stinking awesome
"Beware of re-recordings!! <SEP> Oh, No!!  I didn't see this posted and I am ticked off, these are re-recordings, at least the two Eddie Floyd songs that I was looking for - ""I've Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do)"" and ""Bring It On Home to Me."""
awesome <SEP> I LIKE THIS SONG A LOT. I LIKE MUSIC/SONGS OF SVABO BECH is really awesome how she sings and her voice is really cool too. my favorite song from her is this one and raise you weapon.
do not waste your money <SEP> Not the Hanging Tree from the movie. do not waste your money.
I love you Pete! <SEP> I love Pete Seeger and have the utmost respect for him.  One of the all time greats!  Truly someone to look up to in this crazy world.
"This whole set is quite attention getting! <SEP> I now have all three volumes of this very important set.  I agree with some other reviews I have read that the Nielsen Symphonies are underplayed and undervalued, especially in the mid-twentieth century genre. This is probably true of all Nielsen, in my opinion, although the Symphonies are among his most respected works. This pairing of the second and third is a very interesting and rewarding disc of two quite unusual works. Both works sound and ""feel"" programmatic but Nielsen always steadfastly denied that. The closest example of the perception of ""programmatic"" is ""The Four Temperments"", referring at least in origin, to the theories of the human psyche by the Greek physician Galen. Similarly, Nielsen intended his ""Espansiva"" to represent - somewhat - the various moods and sounds one experiences in nature; though never too literally. The performances, here, are just a little understated and less volatile than some renditions although they are very fine. I personally think this whole series of the Nielsen Symphony with the New York Phil and Alan Gilbert is one of the best available. The performances are quite good and the SACD sound from DaCapo is excellent. I also think that, perhaps, this set will stand as one of the best things Gilbert did with New York is his relatively short tenure. Highly recommended!"
"Facile garbage <SEP> These are slick, facile, and very un-Nielsen-sounding performances. Alan Gilbert clearly doesnt get Carl Nielsen; the opening movement of the Third Symphony is made to sound like 19th-century Italian opera, and the slow movements come across like Coplands Appalachian Spring. Soprano Morley has a shrill, nasal voice that grates on ones ears like nails on a blackboard and baritone Hopkins is just there. Nor do things improve in the Second Symphony, which sounds more like The Four Mood Swings rather than The Four Temperaments. Esa-Pekka Salonen and Douglas Bostock serve this music much better. Dont waste your money on this piece of junk."
I bought this and I can't listen to it. ... <SEP> I bought this and I can't listen to it. Why?? I can't access it - I have to have some kind of amazon player account?? I just want to download it and put it on my ITUNES. %@& Amazon player. I have a player already.
"So moving! <SEP> I absolutely love this song!  I read it in the Hunger Games series and looked it up online, and wanted it as soon as I heard it!  Worth the buy and the time to listen!"
I love the hunger games so it's a good song! <SEP> This is a beautiful love song inspired by the hunger games! I love it. It's just amazing!  This is one of my favorite songs.
Meh <SEP> This almost sounds like a MIDI format in saxophone that was ripped from a video game made 20 years ago. Not good.
One Star <SEP> Not the movie theme.
Two Stars <SEP> song
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"Faulty MP3 file <SEP> Truncated file.  Only  of the music can be downloaded.  Since this is Greek music with a very limited audience, I'm sure this has not been caught before."
awesome <SEP> I wss so excited when I found this.  Even though it is not Christmas I listened this it.  My three year old likes it and I don't allow him to listen to my music.
Love This Song <SEP> This song BLESSES MY SOUL so much!!!
"Five Stars <SEP> A really great album!  Kudos, Lucy!"
Great CD with melodic music.  Worth every cent. <SEP> A very melodic album.  She has a great voice and great guitar playing.  Well worth listening to.  I highly recommend this CD.
"A cultural audio feast <SEP> After having viewed this delightful DVD of the same title, I desired to have the music to listen to while around the house, being domestic, or before going to bed at night, or waking in the AM.  This music transports your awareness to other ground, to other lives.  It's a great audio getaway.....  definitely NOT your teenie FM Rock.  Somehow, it makes me feel as a resident of my home planet, and I like that.

Check out the DVD, too.  Others by Stearns and his co-artists (I am embarrassed that I cannot remember them now) are ""Baracka"" and ""Kronos"".  Check them out.  They all assist with internalizing who you are, who you THINK you are, and connect with those living varied lives than our own here in North America.  Wow.......  what little lives we live here, thinking we are just ""the bee's knees"" as Americans.  Just do it.....  just listen  ....... and be where others are."
"samsara review <SEP> Saw the movie, stunning images but not as ecstatic as 'Baraka'with too many depressing conveyor-belt images and not enough temples for me - wonderful non the less. The sound track sounded good and I have ordered the cd as I've loved the 'Baraka' soundtrack for a long time and enjoy the music of Michael Stearns. The track 'Kothbiro' by Ayuh Ogada which is in the movie but missing from the CD is available on the 1998 album 'Bliss'(various artists on Realworld) This album has a similar spiritual feel to 'Samsara'"
Five Stars <SEP> Great Love song.
"wrong song <SEP> zero stars - this Maria is from Sound of Music NOT West Side Story. It is a charming song in its own right, but that is another story."
"Should be on any synthpop collectors list <SEP> Great stuff, and a must have if you are into Vince Clark.  Nice traveling music.  Not much else to say"
Bad rendition of the Ave Maria <SEP> The soloist who sings the Ave Maria on this is horrible.
"DMX , your music is so helpful and uplifting!!! Thank You.. <SEP> DMX undisputed album is the greatest!!!!  D, you inspired me so much and made me get through some tough times  through your words in your songs especially slippin again and I get scared. I love DMX he is the best!!!! Thank you DMX even though I slipped and fell I won't fall! Because you showed me the way..... xoxoxo"

All Things possible <SEP> Mark Schultz sings one of my favorite Bible verses. Great Christian song.  The price was a great and would recommend family and friends.
GOD OVER MONEY!!! <SEP> LOVE BUMPS REALNESS AND TYPE OF FLOW HE HAS! VERY DIFFERENT STYLE/VOICE FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD!!! HOPE TO SEE GOD OVER MONEY REACH THE MAIN LINE FOR CHRIST!!
A must have on the HHH playlist <SEP> My 9yr old son told me that I must download this. So I did and we Love it. Better than anthing you'll hear on mainstream.
"Evangelistic Help <SEP> I like which way you saints are going with this, you have know idea how much of the unsaved are being saved through your music. Keep it coming brothers and sisters, glory to God!!!

Bumping this in my car TODAY!!!"
"Easy listening meets jazz meets new age. <SEP> I heard this group accidentally on Youtube and was mesmerized by their sound.  I listened to a few of their other songs and decided that I had to have both of their albums.  Ruby's voice is very sensual and soothing, and the jazz progressions are very unique in how they are put together and layered.  Some will probably say that their songs are a bit over produced with echo and reverb to give it sort of a ""dreamy"" sound/quality, but that is what other will love about their music.

If you like the sound, get both of their albums.  Great background music for parties or for a ""romantic evening""...  They also have a free download of an acoustic version of ""All Yours"" that I think you can get from their web page of Facebook page.  (Can't remember exactly where I found it.)"
You have to sing along :) <SEP> I love this fun song!
"Back to What We Remember as being so great. <SEP> Great old song.  I like to have several songs from my informative years on my phone and mp3.  This is great and brings back fond memories.  I can say the same about ""Make it With You, Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow, Stand By Me, Don't Pull your Love Out On Me, and of course Young Girl.""
Like being back in high school and hitting the Top Hat drive in on Saturday night."
the various artists fooled me - horrible versions of beloved songs by unknown <SEP> the various artists fooled me -  horrible versions of beloved songs by unknown artists
"almost like an unplug rendition of it <SEP> prefer the other version i've heard which uses... almost like an unplug rendition of it.  but this one ain't bad.  just a bit too ""dramatic"" at the climax, which was a bit much to my expectations.  overall good."
"Aho, really need to try! <SEP> Definitely soothing to the soul,I own several, this would be one of my favorites in collection and great for meditation. Think anyone would enjoy."
One Star <SEP> wierd stuff here
Terrible remix of the song <SEP> I purchased the wrong one the remix is not what I was looking for. Can't return Amazon music.
eww <SEP> i thought it was the regular track but once downloaded I Recognized that it wasn't. I H8 It.  Can I Get A Refund?
"Catchy <SEP> I like the message, beats, and cool sounds throughout this song.  Love should be the difference between people following Jesus Christ and those who are not especially since GOD IS LOVE."
"One Star <SEP> Only liked the first track. Just want to my taste. Want very ""Skrillexy"""
Great EP! <SEP> I love Damian Marley and Skrillex so having the two together = amazing EP!  Every song on this EP is amazing and sounds really good!
Inspiring <SEP> Inspiring song; great beat; good vocals. Wonderful reminder and well I love walking when I listen to this song. I look around and see the beauty instead of the negative.
"Excellent!! <SEP> Buke and Gase have custom fashioned their instruments to create a truly unique sound. I fell in love with it upon my first listening. This is an entirely creative and alive EP. Their first album is amazing, too. I cannot wait for whatever they do next."
Five Stars <SEP> Enjoying the music.
One Star <SEP> The bitrate is 248kbps. That's ridiculous.
Five Stars <SEP> Can't stop singing to this!
Hate it! <SEP> I bought this song for my kids.  I hate it.  I. Hate. It.
love it <SEP> I love it!  It is a children friendly  song.  It is  the quality  product  one would  expect from Disney!  Thanks!
Really like Ross as a singer <SEP> Good song for age and being more kid/teen music. Ross has a lot of talent! Would recommend for kids and all age appropriate music option.
Five Stars <SEP> I love metal/rock.
Five Stars <SEP> I'm always looking for good vocaloid rock and this album doesn't disappoint.
music <SEP> Just love this tune.
5 Stars <SEP> I love this song.
love this song <SEP> BUT the quality was poor.  It was like someone recorded it off the TV show  to a cassette tape that was sitting in front of the TV.
Awesome Song <SEP> This is a great song.
it worked! <SEP> Normally I find most types of relaxation music more annoying than relaxing. But after 3 nights of insomnia I was desperate. I listened to a lot 30 second clips on here and found this on to be the least annoying and thought for 89 cents - what the heck! I put it on loop on my player and fell asleep sometime during the second play through and had the best sleep I've had in a long time.
Five Stars <SEP> it lasts many hours and I slept great !
The distortion present in the recording was so annoying I actually deleted the recoding to be done with ... <SEP> Not at all relaxing. The distortion present in the recording was so annoying I actually deleted the recoding to be done with it. Bad to try and sleep.
Five Stars <SEP> Good investment in peace
OK <SEP> many songs but gets old
"Pretty good song <SEP> don't like this one as much as others but it still is a pretty good song though, you should give it a listen."
CRAPPY! <SEP> I hate this song so much i hadn't hered it yet and i wanted to try it and it is the worst song EVER!
"I absolutely love this music <SEP> I absolutely love this music.  I put it on repeat and it plays all night long... if I wake up, helps me go right back to sleep.  My little dog loves it to, sleeps all night long, peacefully.  I wake well-rested and ready for my day.  I highly recommend it."
"Didn't like this at all <SEP> This gave me nightmares when I listened to it while I was sleeping. Might be ok for someone else, but it sure didn't work well for me."
One Star <SEP> did not order this??????
Two Stars <SEP> Nice music but much too sedate for my Thanksgiving crowd
"heart beat <SEP> never got to download it,still charge for it.than they try to sneak 7 other songs that i never even heard of.poor"
Acker Bilk - Sound Horrible <SEP> I purchased this album because Acker has a great sound.  However the tracks were scratcy and distorted.
"I love this song <SEP> You can't go wrong with the KING OF BROWN SOUND, LITTLE JOE Y LA FAMILIA. Little JOE HERNANDEZ is always keep it strong in TEJANO music. GOT TEJANO"
"Perfect song for a Wedding, but it has 2 breaks!!! <SEP> Tyrone Wells is an amazing writer, and vocalist.  I happened upon ""This Moment Now"" on YouTube, and knew I needed to sing this song at my Niece's wedding in April.  I downloaded this song from iTunes, and upon playing, discovered that there are 2 breaks in the song...at 3:02 and 2:51.  The song was damaged.  Not to be defeated, I turned to Amazon, and downloaded the song.

Same break in the same places.  The original source material sent out to Amazon and iTunes is corrupt.

A preview of this song - or any downloaded song - is not enough to be sure there isn't an error.

My advice - definately buy the entire Beautiful World EP, but do not have hopes to use the instrumental version of ""This Moment Now"" in a wedding."
Power! <SEP> One of my favorite songs right now. The power of the song goes deep into your spirit. Project 86 at its finest.
"Good flow <SEP> Good hard song with good transitions. I would like to hear some other stuff by this band, I like their style and sound."
Four Stars <SEP> Great
Not my style. <SEP> Just the normal west cost rap.
"Growing Up in the South In the 50's <SEP> This song is like a hymn.  Takes you back to the ""good ole days"" of the 50's.  And the days were very good!"
Absolutely magnificent! - Wish it was on DVD too!! <SEP> What a great concept! His music is out of this world. I just wish he'd have a DVD of his music as watching him play is as great as the sound of the songs!
Five Stars <SEP> Good tune.
The WEAKEST Tune On The CD... <SEP> It's merged with the song before it and the rhythm is exactly the same as the song before it. Real bad programming; other than that it would have been ok segregated from the 2nd tune.
Five Stars <SEP> My sons LOVES this music and I don't mind it either!
"Love the music! <SEP> My kids danced for hours. I even enjoy listening to this and find myself singing along :O) Great buy!
I would recommend for boys and girls, so much fun!"
Nothing is. <SEP> Excellent.
Five Stars <SEP> Disco classic!
"Awesome song <SEP> Great song, no need for all these words, great song says it all. Disco lives whether some folks what it too or not."
"Disappointed <SEP> I was hoping it was a music 'video' of the Pirate Band doing Belay so I could play it on a bigger format than my mobile phone for my grandson.  All we saw the the picture of Jake...and he was disappointed, as was I.  As for the video, we have to go through the web and pull it up from YouTube to see it on my Kindle Fire."
Various Taste <SEP> It brings back some excellent memories from my younger days.
Five Stars <SEP> good song
Awesome song!!! <SEP> This song has such a cool beat!!!  Love it!!!  Great for fans of Tinker Bell and anyone who loves the sound of pop music!
"Upbeat,  Happy! <SEP> nice to have a happy pop song for  a little one to dance to and not worry about the lyrics,"
Avett Brothers <SEP> My current favorite song from this album.  Hope to be able to get the video.  Don't know how to work the Kindle yet.
"A superb artist! <SEP> I have been a Smoke E Digglera fan since he was a part of the group Playa. He can really sing!!!! He did Aaliyah's ""One In A Million"" Tribute justice and is in my opinion the best remake/tribute when compared to Omarion and The Dream. It's so sad that he so underrated like most of the great artists/singers are..."
"Best song to come along in YEARS! <SEP> Fantastic song - reminds me of early 70's, folk-pop Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The cello is amazing (I love cellos!). Definitely a ""get-stuck-in-your-head"" type of song!"
"Loved this song right away! <SEP> I don't usually like songs the first time I hear them, but this one had me hooked from the beginning.  The McClain Sisters have beautiful harmonizing voices."
"Gentle, played with love. <SEP> Really nice choice of Beatles songs, some of my favorites, and love what they did with them. Gentle, played with love. The kids love it, and it's a big help getting them to sleep. Really nice."
"Fabulous Dance Remix! <SEP> Love this remix!  Makes you want to get up and dance!  Like it better then the original.  Even if you're not a Mariah fan (if that's possible!), you will LOVE this!!"
"Classic recording <SEP> Beethoven being my favorite composer, and the EROICA is my favorite symphony of all time, by all classical composers.  This album is the reason why - I purchased as a young teen and played it over, and over and over and over!  I listened to it so often that my younger brother got to love it too, so long ago we wore out my record. I now have this recording (which is arguably my favorite recording of the symphony, certainly my favorite vintage recording of the symphony)  however, my brother still enjoys listening to records so I bought it for him as a Christmas gift.  He was delighted to get it and says it is in quite good condition."
sad <SEP> I love jazz not this type sad Ramsey Lewis is a great jazz man and have other cd albums of his oh well
"Awesome fourth album by the austrailian groovy funk rock band <SEP> Awesome fourth album by  the austrailian  groovy funk rock band. this guy's really can jam! Yet another fantastic unsung aussie band,"
"Two Stars <SEP> Slow, slow, slow"
"Third time's a charm <SEP> This album rules! I have all 3 albums from this band and the progression of the music over the course of this band's career has been a real treat to follow. I initially began listening to the band because of their crunchy sound with pop sensibilities, but became more and more into their straight ahead rock. This album has both! Driving guitar rock with awesome melodies and accessible vocals. This should be the album to break these guys!"
"Did Not Meet My Expectations! <SEP> I remember Renaud from an in-person performance at a local Jazz club in my hometown. He gave a splendid presentation with a variety of song standards such as: ""Girl Talk"" during that club date. Unfortunately, this recording, which sounded a lot like voice-over renditions, did not grab my ear. I'm not hearing his actual voice as was experienced in person."
great song <SEP> great song
very interesting and different <SEP> Very interesting and different sound. Not what I was expecting but it really took me away - like on a journey.
"A Well Produced Vocaloid Album... If It's what your looking for. <SEP> I've listened to this album a handful of times now, and I still like it. I barely know any Japanese, but it seems like cybernetic angels singing. It's really good ambient noise.
I can't really describe it well, but some of Nuetrinop & Tempo-P is uploaded on a popuar video site for a full sample. Since My Comments probably don't do this album justice."
70's R&B Dance Tune <SEP> Soul Dance Tune.
"Great forgotten old school Jam! <SEP> Over 30 years later, this jam still holds up! Classic Motown from the late 1970's. Recently saw an episode of ""Unsung"" on the DeBarge family. Several of the older family members originally started with Switch. I also love the fact that the 70's were an era of bands comfortable playing funk, soul, R & B with a disco twinge."
"Great take on a country classic! <SEP> My friends told me about this song, and have always been a fan of the yodeling.  Very catchy...and with a duo whos names are so familiar sounding, it was hard to pass up!"
"A tune for every mood. <SEP> With influences from New Orleans, free jazz, ballads... and with their creative instrumentation, Old Time Musketry's ""Different Times"" makes music related to any mood.  From the joyful ""Parade"" to the introspective ""Hope for Something More"" to the mellow ""Floating Vision"" and the self-described ""Anger Dance"", the energy in this band's music is high.  I love the blend of sax and accordion on ""Star Insignia"",  the 'klezmer' mania of the clarinet and accordion in ""Highly Questionable"" and the solid bass and drum accompaniment throughout the album.  This album makes you at different times want to get up and dance, or sit back and be transported."
"Very Calming <SEP> I had been looking for white noise tracks for a while so that I could focus when I studied. A purchased a few of these at the same and they are really great. Not only do they help me concentrate, but they are also great for relaxing my mind when trying to get to sleep, particularly this track with the Tibetan Singing Bowl."
Great for studyig <SEP> I use this to drown out background noise while I'm studying. I like it better than classical music' and it doesn't make me sleepy.
"Update on a classic! <SEP> I loved this update on Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata-  Have always loved the original and found this arrangement lovable too!
Since I make my own CD's for pleasure listening, I can easily include this in my current chill out music."
"A cynical attempt at cross-over appeal <SEP> Far be it from me to pull up a purist soapbox on this issue; rather, I'd suggest that this album is a largely light-weight and cynical attempt to achieve greater success in some sort of perceived crossover market.

While it certainly worked for Liberace and Andrea Bocelli in the Classical-Pop vein, the musical results of these sorts of attempts are almost uniformly disappointing and bland.

This is no exception - you'd do better sticking with Bad Plus, Robert Glasper, Theo Bleckmann, James Blood Ulmer, Medeski Martin and Wood, 70s-era Miles, Headhunters, Jim Black's Alasnoaxis, Wallace Roney, the WSQ, Chris Thile, Jason Moran, etc etc. The list is long and extensive of more successful attempts at the fusing of jazz and pop, and well worth perusing."
Four Stars <SEP> Who does not like a good yodel?
"""Music on Hold"" is deceptive -- false advertising? <SEP> I paid  $0.89 to download a royalty-free mp3 music file to use on our company's phone system while customers' are waiting on the phone. That is the definition of ""Music on Hold"", and that is what the product description and picture of a phone imply.  Instead, I got to listen to a song on-line or download an app for my cell phone or computer, so that I could pay $8.99 per month to listen to Amazon music.  I think this is false advertising, and I am surprised that Amazon would allow this sort of deception."
wouldn't recommend <SEP> Would not recommend this cd or music...Not all tracks work.....static in tracks as well....tracks one to three do not work at all....locks cd up from playing
Why does this exist? <SEP> I came across this on Spotify and listened to a few tracks and boy do they stink! Not that any of these songs are great to start -- the cream of the crop when it comes to pop drivel -- but Jesus H. Christ are these mediocre. Just really sub-par recordings with low rent backup singers not trying very hard and failing very hard. My question still stands: Why does this exist?
annoyed and irritated <SEP> This song sounds like it's on a constant loop. It starts off very relaxing until I realize it's the same wave sound on a loop. I'm very annoyed and irritated. I'm glad I only spent .89 cents!
"Amazing! <SEP> I use to love watching her perform live in LA and FINALLY I bought her album. There are a few different styles (which can sometimes make the album feel disjointed), considering she is a spoke word artist AND a singer. She even throws in a rap or two. She is a very multi-talented woman. I love listening to her songs even though I have to break up the album onto different playlists because each song has a different feel from the others."
"A Sure Hit! <SEP> Have been following Chris Richardson since his debut on American Idol some years ago.  Met him several times, and seen him perform live as a solo artist several times.  His talent for creating music is amazing.  Joy and Pain is beautiful, relevant, and current. This song is just the tip of the iceberg...get ready world!"
Five Stars <SEP> Such beautiful music......
Two Stars <SEP> OK
Waaaaay tooooo sloooooow <SEP> I love this piece of music but they have slowed it down so much I spent more time being aggravated waiting for the next note than being able to relax and sleep.
Two Stars <SEP> got it by accident didn't like it much
"Excellent, as always. <SEP> Reckless Kelly never disappoints.  They've managed to write a very political song and have done it without choosing sides.  Instead, they discuss the responsibility of the voters and how ultimately, it is up to us to make the changes we need as a country, by exercising our right to vote and by using that right wisely.

I love this band.  I have followed them for years, and they just keep getting better."
One Star <SEP> Too much piano.  Just does not flow well
One Star <SEP> Quality of recording...very bad
Four Stars <SEP> Love the single
"Crybaby <SEP> I can't believe I paid for this track. We've all heard these ""woe is me"" songs before. This guy's such a whiner. Literally."
I love you <SEP> Glory to God. He is who deserves all the honor and praise. He mercy entirety forever. I love him because he first loved me.
"I heard a different version first and I was disappointed when I realized this wasn't it <SEP> I heard a different version first and I was disappointed when I realized this wasn't it! Good song, just not the version that I vibe with!"
"Funky <SEP> This ex-Prince-protege group has proved once again that they are the student transformed into the teacher.  Prince, take note.  The Family has written better material in one album than you have in the last 15 years.  Thanks to you for influencing these artists to create such soulful, funky and fun music."
Very cool album. First heard him on Lucha Underground on ... <SEP> Very cool album. First heard him on Lucha Underground on the El Rey Network. Not your typical tejano. This album really rocks.
Great music <SEP> Great download!  Love the music!  Would download again from amazon!  The cost was lower than the purchase of the cd!
"Real Music! <SEP> Jay Adams I am so glad to finally hear from an artist who has something to say and has muic worth listening to. This Brother is worthy of his comparisons to Marvin Gaye and on this one you can scacely tell the difference. The music is like Hip-Hop/Jazz, That's right and it is bad! Thank you my brother for standing up and delivering a quality product. say it Loud! I'm Black and I'm Proud! Again!"
"with guest vocal by Annette <SEP> As much as I have always loved Annette, this album was a big disappointment to me. It is titled ANNETTE on CAMPUS with THE WELLINGTONS and THE ALL AMERICAN CHORUS.

It shoud have been titled THE ALL AMERICAN CHORUS on Campus with The Wellingtons and special guest vocals by annette.

Annette only sings on a few tracks. Whether or not you enjoy this album will depend on how much you enjoy hearing school songs. I didn't.

It has a sexy cover photo of lovely Annette at about age 21.

This was a big rip-off from Buena Vista Records.

Not suprisingly, it has never been on CD.

You can find an inexpensive copy on eBay."
CALI BASED <SEP> As always it's particular on the ratchet genre type of music. Nice little beat to get the party started and to get the females to twerk.
Five Stars <SEP> nice
Five Stars <SEP> love this song!!!
"Too bad, not ""Bad Plus"" <SEP> I heard them live in St. Louis, for some reason this recording doesn't fit the bill. Too bad, not ""Bad Plus""."
"The guys are so cool <SEP> I was lucky enough to be invited to a concert where Halloween, Alaska performed. They were good but David King was awesome. I was then even luckier and got  to see The Bad Plus at the Dakota here in Minneapolis...those guys were terrific.  This is a great CD... Pound for Pound, the first track, is gorgeous. Ethan Iverson's playing is intoxicating... amazing it is legal, it is so good."
"Renee Fleming sings like an angel and the repertoire included on the CD ... <SEP> Absolutely fabulous CD.  Renee Fleming sings like an angel and the repertoire included on the CD is divine.  Thank you so, so much ...exquisite, perfect in every way. Bravo!!!"
"top-notch offering from Renee Fleming! <SEP> An excellent selection of material and, of course, a beautiful voice."
"Great cover, but not of TMBG <SEP> Istanbul was a popular cover song throughout the 60's and 70's, ending with the generation-defining 1989 version by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Might-Be-Giants/dp/B001MCSXYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Might Be Giants</a>. Some reviewers seem to think this version is based on those, especially TMBG.  And while I, too, have a special place for the TMBG cover, the Chris Milan and Jay Phoenix version is actually a slick and swinging cover of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1953-original/dp/B00C6TZOQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1953 original</a>&nbsp;by The Four Lads, complete with vocal sampling.

The jazz-swing undertones heard here reveal the song's cradle-of-rock heritage, stripped of the later electric guitar trappings.  It's a great cover for a dance floor or a party, and now you can roll your eyes knowingly when one of your GenX friends calls it a TMBG cover."
Wonderful music <SEP> I have enjoyed listening to this several times. Renee Fleming has a beautiful voice and she does a wonderful job singing. I am planning to purchase more of her music.
"more amazon trash <SEP> three different mixes of the same song?  none of which are the original song?  Amazon, please stop putting these up as actually albums!  You are killing sales when I can't find real albums and instead stumble upon messes like this.  Thankfully iTunes and Google Play would like my money."
"A Disappointment: Noise Reduction Not Used Correctly in Remastering. <SEP> This is the CD Release on the ""Big Pink"" Label from Korea ($22+s&h).
Mini LP Casing and Inserts are very cool.
(could've been a little more imaginative for the CD label..{orig record lbl maybe??}).
But the Bummer was upon hearing this ""Remaster""..
{bearing-in-mind, that I own & referred to the Original LP for comparison}
 It became immediately apparent that some inept ""Remastering Engineer"" decided to put/implement a Cheap Noise Filter during the Transfer, in-turn, Muffling sections of the Audio,..
which is very noticeable during the softer sections.
When I hear this, a lot of times  it makes me Suspicious that LP's are used for remastering to CD.
(i'm not saying that actually happened in this case...)
..Granted; that this recording was made before modern Dolby AB was a Standard.
But I have some experience/knowledge in the area of Mixing/Mastering,
and I feel that a ""'Tin-ny' 60's Recording"" could be ""Professionally Remastered"" alot better,
than just throwing a ""cheap plug-in"" all over it..
I don't know if this album was released on CD  on other labels, but if so,
my advice would be to check out those Other Releases, before paying nearly $30 for this one..."
Beautiful! <SEP> Wonderful music...Beautifully composed and played. I'm enjoying this cd right out of the box! Wanted music to work by. Perfect!
Great listen! <SEP> Love this album!
"Love the song <SEP> I love this song, so I'm happy to have found it on amazon! It's very catchy, I love the song."
awesome <SEP> This is my favorite YFM song. They were talking about putting out a whole album but never found it. Loved it when it first came out and still love it.
"It is morally wrong to pay the current asking price for any album. <SEP> Amused to Death is a masterpiece that everyone should hear.

Having said that, it doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter how much of a masterpiece Amused to Death is, how much you love it, how much you love vinyl, how awesome your sound system is, or how devoted a fan you are. What the current asking price is -- well, Amazon tends to edit prices out of reviews, but it's exactly between one thousand and five hundred. If you pay that kind of money for a music album, no matter how grand and powerful, you had better be donating at least ten times that amount to charity each year. If you can say that, you have my blessing. Otherwise, I condemn you.

You can be assured of two things:

1. Roger Waters would not want you wasting such a vast sum on his album, when you could help someone with it.

2. Roger Waters will not receive the majority of that sum, if any of it.

More importantly, however, a remixed and remastered Amused to Death is being re-released this year (2015), in every format, INCLUDING a lavish two-disc vinyl set. If you are a fan, you will want that. The price, while high, is a mere fraction of what this person is asking for his old LP. So there's absolutely no reason to pay this insane amount for an obsolete ""collectible"". Please, don't do it.

Pink Floyd fans have a history of paying insane amounts of money for products which do not merit it. Please be one of the people to turn this tide. There are so many better things you could do."
Not worth it <SEP> This CD is played with a key board. It is not played by a professional. Do not buy. Two more words required for me to publish my feedback.
Five Stars <SEP> this song is killing it
Awesome! <SEP> I was really excited when Further Seems Forever announced that they were back together with essentially the same lineup from The Moon Is Down. This single did not disappoint. Can't wait for the album!
Beautiful Harmonies. Enchanting Arrangement. <SEP> Looking forward to more beautiful compositions from this Artist.  Quality content from an original Artist that is sure to gain international acclaim over time.  Recommended.
Two Stars <SEP> Not exactly the music in the game. U want the EXACT music files from the actual game!!!!
"One of the finest Greek singers <SEP> This album sung by Nena Venetsanou with only piano accompaniment is one of the most wonderful albums by a Greek singer or any singer, for that matter. Nena has a stunningly beautiful voice. I in particular liked the collection of songs by Mikis Theodorakis with words by the great poet Yannis Ritso."
I know Bruce Dickinson but I hadn't heard this song ... <SEP> I know Bruce Dickinson but I hadn't heard this song that picked my interest because of the shared birth year
"I purchased all of these I could find.. ... <SEP> I purchased all of these I could find....except the one for $99.00. The album itself is of no importance to me becasue the songs are on other albums. It is the cover I coveted. The lovely young woman featured on the cover is my Kumu, Puanani Alama (in 1958). I gifted the others I bought to Hula Sisters in my Halau and our Kumu autographed them for us. Priceless to us! Mahalo nui loa to you and to al the other sellers...."
Better <SEP> Better.
I'd like to see what else i can find <SEP> The power of this song shook me to the core. I'd like to see what else i can find.
The Lost Tapes <SEP> George Harrison no. 1 just like the rest of the Beatles.
"NO song Titles Listed in This Ad <SEP> not listing song titles make it almost impossible to buy, i'd like to at least know what i'm buying"
"don't buy it, it's all rehash with different cover ... <SEP> don't buy it, it's all rehash with different cover,.un less you don't have this junk in your colletion. I Think his early stuff is ok. This is his later music"

Review of music purchased from Pavement Ends <SEP> Individual songs were purchased not the whole album. The songs which were publised play in good quality. I'll be purchasing more songs from Little Big Town.
Five Stars <SEP> I Like It
Another great one by Little Big Town <SEP> Pontoon is one of those songs you listen to when you are heading to the lake with family or a bunch of friends. It's catchy and will have you dancing and singing along.  Little Big Town made another hit with this one.  I gave it a five star because I couldn't give it anything else!
Five Stars <SEP> Satisfied.
David Guetta does an excellent job with the songs he writes!!! <SEP> THIS SONG IS SO AWESOME AND EASY TO DANCE TO!!!!
Love it. Sounds phenomenal on a good sound system <SEP> Love it.  Sounds phenomenal on a good sound system.

Five Stars <SEP> One of the best poems about Death ever written.
Awesome music on Cd paper sleeve <SEP> Paper Sleeves Series are awesome. All CDs suppose to be made like that. No more plastic boxes!!!. Bee Gees and the music those days back are priceless.
"Don McLean's Most Unpopular Songs <SEP> I was very disappointed with the song selections. With the exception of two songs that I recognized out of the 30, they all sounded the same. Very boring. I would not recommend this two CD set."
"I'm a big McLean fan, but...... <SEP> I am a very big fan of Don's songs but this cd is pretty boring. I wish he had stuck to singing his own great stuff."
"Nice way for kids to learn <SEP> Kids love sining along wth this, add some hand signals and pictures of the helpers and you have a nice lesson."
"copy cat nu-metal <SEP> Hostile Groove is a nu-metal band that is unique. The lead singer really has a distinct voice. Nu-metal doesn't have a lot to offer,but these guys are a decent nu-metal band that only made one album. They are touring again,and hopefully they will make a 2nd cd. Hostile Groove is basically a copy cat band,because the guitars are kinda generic,the drums don't have much to offer,and the lyrics are very cheesy. It is a catchy album,but it gets old,because the vocals are just ok and the sound is just ok. Pretty disappointing for a nu-metal band."
"His music went from feel good to generic garbage Rap <SEP> What happened? His music went from feel good to generic garbage Rap. Thanks for letting me know about how much money you have Leslie, and lets not forget about the trips and cars you have. You're better than this."
One Star <SEP> Crap Album
Ryan stunk up his own music. Les was not more <SEP> Didn't understand why ryan Leslie chose to rap instead of sing like on his previous CDs. I was very disappointed. He has to go back to his old style.
"UNTHINKABLE <SEP> I rate this song a ""0"". And there shoulnd't be a rating here at all. My daughter tried to buy this song, she was mistaken. WITW people! Why would you want to dance with the devil? And some of you would say ""its just a song. Well, ever heard of ""what goes into the mind comes out"". This type of music is unGodly and shouldn't be available. UNTHINKABLE for even the 1 star to allow this!!!"
Beautiful cd! Very enjoyable <SEP> Beautiful cd! Very enjoyable! I enjoy this every time that I listen to it!  I love Micky Dolenz!  I love his music (as well as The Monkees!)  Very happy with item and seller! Thank you!
Indie hip hop's most dynamic duo <SEP> The energy from this dynamic duo is amazing. I attended one of their shows and I was a instant fan. Thank you to Strangemusic for these two incredible human beings.
"Japanese <SEP> I heard this song on a TV show (I can't remember which one).  At the time I thought it sounded great, so I put it on my wishlist.  Now that I own it, its not all that.  I'm happy with it, but I wish I had downloaded something else."
"I didn't read the fine print which indicated that these are all covers <SEP> I didn't read the fine print which indicated that these are all covers, not the original versions.  If you are looking for musak, it's probably ok, but otherwise you will be disappointed."

"Inspirational <SEP> Great music, sent to my missionary."
Five Stars <SEP> i play it over and over
Five Stars <SEP> good album. hard to find and love it.
"Industrial music is an extraordinary musical art by itself and many amazing artists have proving to be one of the best ... <SEP> HANDS label has been producing (Rhythmic Noise) since the early 90s.  I have not seen one single review for their albums as of yet on Amazon.  Well, heres mine.  Industrial music is an extraordinary musical art by itself and many amazing artists have proving to be one of the best electronic genre.  Like metal, many out there are shy of given this eccentric sound a chance to circle their ear and mind.  Dirty K is one of many great artists that brings a crushing sound of what industrial music is all about and believe me theres many who can provide that sound at its best.  I admire and listen to everything outhere that makes the human soul garnish for sincerity and admiration to the musical art most artists have been given us since the beginning of time.  Keep an open mind and enjoy many colorful sounds and if you don't at least you set on that chair and found it its not to your comfort.  Cheers"
Great voice.  He sings this version so well. <SEP> I love his voice as much as I love his brother's.  Beautiful song and he sings it so well. Great.  But it. Listen
"horrible is flattery for this <SEP> I saw her in a Sunday paper mag and looked her up on youtube. After some 20 seconds of her cloroxed hair and zombie/ghoul eyes plus the silly, infantile music I was left with the same impression American pop culture has left in me for the past thirty-odd years. So much for another vile product of our ""corporate-driven youth culture"". I would prefer to watch Night of the Living Dead with my own choice of musical background, but no more of this woman and the noises she makes. Nunca mas!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Great Song <SEP> Good download, quick convenient. Sounds good as well. Settings with Amazon player easy to access from anywhere! Would reccommend this service."
Don't bother <SEP> The original is excellent - these remixes actually ruin a good track.
enjoyable <SEP> Enjoyed this song.  I have just been introduced to her work. It is earthy and powerful. Try it for yourself.
"Regarding Rodan.... <SEP> Great album but the track Trojan Warfare is listed as featuring Rodan but he does not appear on this amazon edition of the album.

http://manafestvisionmedia.bandcamp.com/album/soundclash-1-meccagodzilla-vs-007 is technically a superior edition because it has the Rodan verse intact. And Rodan is great."
"Love this song! <SEP> Love that I can download a song and play it in seconds!

So convenient and then mobile anywhere in the Cloud"
Two Stars <SEP> Not a great arrangement.
Five Stars <SEP> Killer tune as always
"Sweet electro! <SEP> Bangin track! Great bass, too. There's a lot of good stuff and experimental genres on this album. Check out all the tracks, you'll probably find something you like if you're into electronic music at all."
Five Stars <SEP> great beat!!
"Awesome CD <SEP> Great worship songs from a few different worship leaders. Includes faster and slower songs. Put it on, lift your hands to the King of Kings and be BLESSED!!"
"fresh worship <SEP> really like this album. it is just different from hillsong united, and the passion related artists. definitely worth the purchase!"
Five Stars <SEP> love
I have never heard of any of the songs on ... <SEP> I have never heard of any of the  songs on this CD even though I watch service. I was very dissapointed.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome. His best work yet. Every single song is so good.
Five Stars <SEP> Fun dance song!
Beautiful song! <SEP> One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard! It truly captures epic passion and love. I imagine a story of love.
"Great praise music <SEP> This is excellent music and very much appreciated. Great sounds, spiritual, loving, and kind. Reaching out to God is a daily mandate for me and I love the variations of music which bring me closer to him - thank you so much for making this possible!!"
"Remedy Drive survives breakup to sound more alive than ever <SEP> The difficult road to Resuscitate by Remedy Drive began when lead singer David Zachs brothers decided to leave and pursue other options. This was not a band on life-support but in the throes of demise. That such a solid release has emerged, one that must rank among their best work, is a tribute to Zachs persistence and the synergy he has with the new members.

As Zach affirms in a couple of the songs, losing our way does not make us a lost cause. Crisis serves as a setting for the brokenness and hope that inform the lyrics.

On different note, if Coldplay helped bring the piano back to rock, Remedy Drive benefits from that legacy. The creative use of keyboards woven into the fabric of many of these songs is striking. They are the first sounds that you hear on the opening, Better than Life. They continually add a subtle and satisfying beauty to the well-crafted pop/rock found throughout.

I enjoy the latter and normally don't gravitate towards heavier fare. Even so, the hard rock heard on the title track and Make it Bright are strangely beguiling. The raw energy makes these tracks explosive and compelling.

But have you heard the story of Elijah, the Old Testament prophet? God was not in the strong wind, the earthquake or the fire, but in the sound of a low whisper, a thin silence, which brings me to God I Hope So. It is not the sound of quiet desperation, but rather a hopeful longing. Its an honest cry that yearns for a better day. It carries even greater weight than the heavier sounds in the aforementioned tracks. I appreciate the uncertainty because thats what life is like. We can be certain of God but not much else.

Remedy Drive move toward modern worship on Crystal Sea and Glory. If the band was ever dead, this is life from the dead. They add their voice to that mighty throng that stands by the crystal sea.

The theme of the closing Hold On reminds me of the words from Rock of Ages, Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling. When all is stripped away, we must depend on God."
"Resuscitate is fabulous <SEP> Resuscitate is a really good CD or MP3 download.  Good Christian music, lots of faith songs, plenty of good belief to go on."
"Great re-issue from the ""Golden Age"" of studio recordings <SEP> I loved this recording when I was a kid. It's still probably one of the best recordings of this great 1920's operetta by Sigmund Romberg. (Surprisingly, the Nelson Eddy-Doretta Morrow recording is quite good, also.) I've waited to see it re-issued for years. It's infinitely superior to the Mario Lanza one, which drags drags drags. Lehman Engel supervised/conducted it and keeps things moving nicely. Giorgio Tozzi (the voice for Emile de Becque in the movie ""South Pacific"") has the perfect voice for the rousing ""Riff Song"" and the title tune, ""The Desert Song"". His leading lady, Kathy Barr, is good, but without much ""vocal personality""; you do wish for Roberta Peters or Doretta Morrow in the role. The score's somewhat abbreviated, though, more in the tradition of the musical than the operetta; the Nelson Eddy version is more complete."
gited to a friend <SEP> 12 out of 15 songs were incredible and its great to give as a gift since I already know what it's about even though I don't speak Russian!
"Brilliant <SEP> ""Bury me beneath your hair,"" sings Brendan Hines of The Brendan Hines. ""I can't take the morning glare.""

It's an exemplary lyric from his excellent second record, where many of his songs' characters seem to be waking up hung over, minds splitting between emerging details of the night before and existential crisis; others seem never to have left the bed at all, afraid to move lest they wake the stranger who represents their best and only chance of getting home.

If you've ever been there, you'll appreciate this catchy collection of contemplative, pithy tunes, mostly delivered in tones designed to not aggravate the big head of the morning after. But even if you haven't, you'll probably feel for the people in Hines' songs, many of whom reside in a post-Raymond Carver/Elliot Smith Lost Angeles, America that is not so much dystopian as it is rife with ambitious lives marred by a series of small mistakes: ""Oh, what have you done?"" he sings on Cahuenga. ""Oh, this used to be fun.""

Minimalist, often hilarious and always lyrically deft, Hines defies the expectations set by other actors who have made  records. (He is also an award-winning thespian of stage and screen, currently best known for his role as the haplessly honest Eli Loker on Fox's Lie To Me, the procedural crime drama featuring Tim Roth that made the Facial Action Coding System a household word, at least for a while.)

Here, abetted by producers/players Al Sgro (Holly Conlan, Joe Purdy, Gary Jules, Milk Carton Kids) and David Poe (Regina Spektor, Jayhawks' Kraig Jarret Johnson, Duncan Sheik) and thoughtful performances by All Spots To Black Philip Krohnengold (Sara Bareilles, Golden Smog) Ben Peeler (Wallflowers, Jimmy Cliff) and the ethereal vocal accompaniment of Kristen Toedtman, Hines is the rare singer/songwriter who can avoid the world-weary and sentimentali while depicting both -- in these songs, funerals become wakes, benders, teachable moments;; trysts, transcendent.

Highly recommended."
"She must have done something great, indeed <SEP> to have such talent as a songwriter and singer.  This is a beautiful, memorable poignant song, and the counter-version is hilarious.  I am amazed that someone who can write such heartwrenching lyrics and sing with such depth of feeling can also be so flat-out funny.  To say that Cheryl Wheeler is an underrated talent is a huge understatement.  Listen; buy -- you'll be doing yourself a favor.  Also check out other songs such as ""Arrow"" and ""75 Septembers.""  They are wonderful."
Hilarious  - Rupaul Protege does it up <SEP> You may or may not be a fan of the art form of drag and it definitely does not hurt to have some talent behind the look. Shangela Laquifa is no exception. This new generation of drag stars are showing up the old ones in talent..
"Beautifully recorded and simply beautiful! <SEP> So beautiful and so short - why not produce more of this serenity for longer periods for more pleasure!
Can't wait!"
"Misleading Title!!! <SEP> This CD is titled ""Scotland - The Pipes of the Highlands"" yet on the whole CD only THREE of the SIXTEEN tracks have any bagpipe music on them , and that bagpipe playing is marginal at best! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this type of dishonestly advertised garbage!"
"Great song; great artist <SEP> I can't believe no one has reviewed this song, yet.  ""You Are the Cowboy"" is, in a word, amazing, as is the voice behind it.  Very soulful.  Highly recommended."
Calm in a storm <SEP> Alisa Inez always connects with her audience and with the realities in life. Her music is a reflection of peace in the middle of a storm. Her voice calms even the craziest storms. Great to listen to when you feel down or even when you have your you time.  I respect her to the fullest and highly recommend her cd. If you can catch her in concert. You will not be disappointed.
"blah <SEP> maybe good for students to learn from but not for anyone looking for drum core competitions or the like, blah"
Cheryl Wheeler is just delightful to listen to. This ... <SEP> Cheryl Wheeler is just delightful to listen to.  This is one of the songs which will leave you rolling on the floor.
"Beautiful music. <SEP> Love this CD.  Music is great background for working around the house, dinner, etc.  Perfect for quiet entertaining, music is soothing and easy to listen.  No bad songs on this CD."
Really Good! <SEP> I love enjoy how nice it is and when I listen to it it makes me want to read my Bible.
"What you hope to hear from your kids. <SEP> Finally, a song that says something that makes you feel good about life. I am looking forward to hearing more from this gifted songwriter."
"AMAZING TALENTED MUSICIANS <SEP> I Love Everything DBL. NAUGHT SPY CAR PLAYS...If you get a chance to see them perform in person, Do Not Miss!"
One Star <SEP> how could anybody like noisy chewing?  I'm baffled.
"Great Album <SEP> It is really great, and I listen to it very often, even months upon months after buying the Album. It is a really great Album!"
Four Stars <SEP> Very good songwell done wish they had more of her songs
"Love it!! <SEP> Very beautiful, nice sounding smooth song. The song brings joy to my heart and makes me feel blessed and thankful."
"Hot Joint!!! <SEP> Not only does this song have great production and vocals, the lyrical content has an awesome message! This song has an ""R&B"" feel but at the same sustains the gospel groove, all while telling the good news and positive message of the gospel . This dude is definently one to watch on the gospel scene!"
"Great retro- 1970s sound <SEP> Great retro- 1970s sound. These songs sound autobiographical, but should apply to most who grew up in the 1970s. Excellent musicianship and production."
"Jazz 6, Karaoke 2 <SEP> The musicians fill this album with wonderful, sophisticated instrumental jazz.  But a mediocre amateur singer commandeers two songs, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and ""Have You Met Miss Jones?,"" and turns them briefly into jarring karaoke, making repeated listening to those songs painful if not impossible.

So far, Jim, mine is the only review here from an Amazon Verified Purchaser.

But I won't recruit any of my friends to write their initial Amazon reviews in support of mine."
"A Portrait of the Artist <SEP> Bob Woldin has, from sea to shining sea, made gifts of his voice and and his channel to the spiritus mundi. He's produced a folk-rock mixture rendered smooth by his picking style, and wizened by his voice. His voice handles the listener like a well-worn 1st Baseman's mitt, which has seen it all, caught it all, and picked no small number of truths out of the dirt. The songs on this album are driven by character and place sketches, yet here, even the places are characters in narratives that examine the dramatic interaction between the two. Man battles nature as man, as man battles himself. His narrators are tourist, or Beat wanderer. His forces of nature, largely arise from the Sea. Or don't arise, in ""Aloha Tsunami."" Each track is crystal clear in production, and the sequence of tracks gives a palpable sense of progression, as a song cycle should. Special mention must be made for the final track, ""Storm Clouds,"" which makes use of every ""epic-style"" production word in the dictionary. I hear Pink Floyd, I hear me, I hear Neil Young. This is a song that celebrates its active participation in the Rock heritage of the larger than life, deeper than purple musical tradition. I'll make this simple for you.

Buy this album."
"love this song! <SEP> I heard this song while watching ""Switched at Birth"" and decided to google some lyrics to find out what it was. Such a pretty song! Wonderful group. I need to listen to more of their stuff."
excellent album. the music is great <SEP> excellent album.the music is great.wonderful singer.i wish it wasn't a concept album.the songs are strong by themselves.im a big fan of DayBehavior.
"This is one of the best new full albums I've heard in a while -- ... <SEP> This is one of the best new full albums I've heard in a while -- it's solid the entire way through, with the songs being catchy but not so poppy that they lose the edge I'm hoping for from this sort of music. I would highly recommend this album both to someone already familiar with the genre and someone just dipping their toes in.

While the entire thing is solid, 'Stitch' is the track that really stood out to me. I've listened to it probably a dozen times in the few days since I first heard this album, and at this point it's solidly one of my top ten or twenty songs of all time. Something about an industrial song with good use of brass instruments just gets me every time. Only a handful of bands (Thrill Kill Kult, PIG) have pulled it off, and More Machine than Man does it with the best of them."
"For help with pain in neck, jaw, back, etc. <SEP> if you are having back, neck, jaw issues, this is a wonderful CD for exercises to relieve the underlying cause of your pain."
No Good <SEP> I would rather hear cats fighting than this album
Four Stars <SEP> Killer album by a killer band!!
If you like neopclassical shred you'll love this CD <SEP> This man rules the guitar!  This CD has even more enjoyable music with great chord progressions and melodies.  Clean crisp virtuo-tastic.  Many musicians are one trick ponies.  Nice but every piece starts to sound the same.  Mr. Stump does not suffer this fate.
"Love cassie <SEP> i have to admit I hated this song at first, but it grew on me and I love it she is a nice singer."
not as good as I hoped <SEP> This song was ok I got this off pandora cuz it was playing the original and when I bought this it wa sent the same
"Listen first <SEP> Only like 2 or 3 songs on this album, listen before you buy!"
"great rendition <SEP> loved it! very peaceful and inspiring, great version of a beloved traditional American song. Would definitely recommend it to friends and family"
It's not as good as a original <SEP> Don't care for remastered songs to much. It's not as good as a original.
Go Big Red <SEP> Brown's music is perfect to get pumped up on the way to watch the huskers. Keep up the good works and Go Big Red!
"Why? Why? Why?? <SEP> Why was there no [Explicit] warning or stuff of the sort? I would've really appreciated one so I wouldn't have spent money on this. Between that and how thin the music is, I cannot say this was a good buy. There's no intensity to the music, nothing to pay for or support here, move along."
"Pleasantly surprised <SEP> I'm really digging these tracks. Very high energy, especially the first two songs. I'm really happy I went ahead and bought the whole thing, since originally I was only going to buy ""Destroy Them With Lasers""."
"Fantastic, fresh single from a wonderful new band <SEP> I first heard these guys on ""Triple J,"" the Australian radio station. I was transfixed and immediately searched the Web for their music. For $0.00, this song is the best bargain you'll see on Amazon.

What is their music like? Psychedelic; poppy; atmospheric; a bit haunting, I think; original but pleasingly familiar for people who love lo-fi-ish pop psychedelia from the 60s, 80s, and beyond. It's definitely headphone music, but it also sounds damn good coming out of tinny computer speakers.

The older I get, the harder it is to get excited about a new band. Sometimes I feel like I've heard it all before. This is one of the few new bands that hit that great balance between a classic sound and an original approach.

In short: Tune in, turn on, download ""Life's a Beach""!"
Great tune <SEP> Nice addition to my workout mix.
"Can't get it out of my head! <SEP> Thanks to WXPN and XM radio, I've heard this song enough to want to own it. It is in a similar style to that of Passion Pit and other modern technopop music."
"Nice beat <SEP> What more can I say, it's a good song. I really don't have 11 more words to say how great it was."
If you get a chance... <SEP> Look up the video on youtube of this song from the 1950s.  The drummer plays with such easy around the kit.
"Charming, some-what folk-like music <SEP> I discovered Tokiko Kato's music many years ago at a caberet in Sapporo. (Her ""Hyaku-man-bon no bara""--which is the Japanese translation of ""Million million alyh roz"" made famous by Alla Pugachova--used to be a staple in karaoke bars)  This album is a charming collection which range from something that sounds like something by Karl Jenkins or Dead Can Dance to popular Japanese folk songs. It's a bit lightweight, however--a lot of the songs sound very similar.  For people who want an introduction to Tokiko Kato, I would recommend getting one of her Greatest Hits albums.

(And for people who can understand Japanese, there is a fascinating interview with her on YouTube talking about her musical genesis in the riots of 1966.)"
<NULL> <SEP> Not good at all !
Silly <SEP> This was the only song I could find by Melanie.   .  WTH !?! She has talent ! This was a waste !
jazzy <SEP> This album grows on you the more you listen to it. The playing is first class all the way and the three musicians swing together.
Five Stars <SEP> good music
I never received it. It is not in my ... <SEP> I never received it .  It is not in my download history.
One Star <SEP> same song over and over
"SOMEBODY KILL THEM ALREADY! <SEP> Everyone has a track that they can play during just about anything, making the event even better than it already was. This is one of those tracks.

Chances are that you heard Bandit Slaughter in Borderlands 2 during the Circle of Slaughter games, where it would play while you're met with onslaught after onslaught of bandits and other enemies. That was one of my favorite parts in the game, and part of the reason is because of the music that played during the whole thing. Bandit Slaughter easily makes it into my top 25 game tracks list, being a track that gets me pumped whenever I hear it.

This is the kind of music I play when I go running, when I'm play-fighting with my daughter, having a round of laser tag with my brother at the arcade, or just plain having a good time. The music's upbeat, dynamic and energetic- exactly what you want to be listening to when waves of enemies are trying to kill you in the game and you have to kill everyone in order to move on to the next round. Circle of Slaughter was one of the only times in my gaming history where I DIDN'T get sick of hearing one track over and over, even when I'd die several times in a row and restart the quest each time.

Go listen to the full track on a site that has a video of Circle of Slaughter or something, in the chance that you haven't heard it. The audio quality on the download is perfect, and with good headphones, I heard a few parts that I hadn't noticed when guns were going off and bandits were screaming their war cries. This track really reminds me of some kind of remix of music from the first Terminator movie. My one nitpick about the mp3 is that it's not loud enough! Even when I crank up the volume all the way on my phone with headphones in, it's not as loud as I'd like.

But hey, that just shows how rad it is. Buy it. You're missing out if you don't."
Skip this one <SEP> A truly horrible recording. Sutherland sounds like a screeching bird.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent song.
"Check out this band form Mexico <SEP> -Laura has a deep voice, which permeates a unique personality to the sound of the band. On the other hand we can hear the influence of rock and electronic fused with synthesizers and rhythms delicious to the ear. I like their sound, really digestible. Sometimes you might think its pretentious but I think it's because every song just crafted and polished exhaustively.

-Ka-Volta-

...listen to them and enjoy a national band with global aspirations
-sabotage magazine-

...The art of experimentation
- el informador-

Of electronic tones, the music of The BackandForths is influenced by the sounds of synth-pop, new wave and punk, dark melodies and offering reminiscences of British post-punk scene of the late seventies.

-Eldescafeinado-"

Great song! <SEP> Very energetic and skillfully written song.  It always makes me dance when I hear it.  Great rap collaboration by talented artist.
Absolutely Breath taking <SEP> Hauntingly beautiful.  It touches your soul.  What and incredibly talented artist.  So beautiful!!!

"not vocal <SEP> It's from an album Amazon lists as ""Vocal Music (Cantigas De Amigo - 13Th Century Galician-Portuguese Songs and Dances of Love, Longing and Devotion)"" but this is an instrumental version of Cantiga 11.
Don't get me wrong, the instrumentalists here do a very pretty job, but if you're looking for the full song with, you know, the lyrics that were written with it, look elsewhere.
Sorry, Ensemble Alcatraz.  While I'm sure it's not your fault this is mislabeled, until Amazon changes the listing I need to warn people away."
I found two versions of this song by Noel Coward... <SEP> ... I think this is the earlier one.  It's jauntier than the other and less filled with ironic self-importance.  One imagines it might be more the style when Coward was at his height of popularity.
"Five Stars <SEP> Saw her at Morningstar and, WOW!  This one can sing!  Would give it more stars if possible!"
"Amazing Artist and Song <SEP> This song is amazing!  The music just makes you want to sing along.  Ethan Jones is a great up-and-coming artist, with lots of great hits."
"Know what you are buying, <SEP> Unfortunately, a list of songs was not included with the description of the CD.  I took the chance and ordered it figuring that some of the more popular selections would be included.  I was wrong, but oh well, live and learn."
One Star <SEP> ugh
Album was warped <SEP> The album was in great condition except for the fact that it was warped when I bought it.
"some not very good music <SEP> not as worthy as her other works, doesn't even bear the weight of his name. I make my self listen to it in case it becomes more likable... but not yet."
"Kid looooves it. I hate it. <SEP> Of all the KidzPob we have bought, I really can't stand to listen to this one.  My girl would play it over and over.  I like the song, not this version.  Something about the pitch?"
"Fantastic song <SEP> This song is one of my absolute favorites. Beautiful lyrics. It is also a must to watch the video, well done!"
Not able to download. <SEP> Amazon wouldn't let me download...
"Purchased a while ago, received a defected product. <SEP> I purchased this a while ago, and was very excited since I love this album. However, it arrived to me warped, which distorts the sound just enough to make it unlistenable. The seller at the time did not provide refund/replacement options. Very disappointed."
"One Star <SEP> Plastic case cd was in  was broken.
Case wouldn't hold together!"
Love M.G. but this track is not the same as the other Twilight track w/an acapaella melody at 1:21 on the counter <SEP> Love Gardot. Stop selling this track in this form. It's just the artist talking for a few seconds. It's larceny.
Two Stars <SEP> Not as good as the Barbershop Soundtrack version
Great song <SEP> This song is a true street anthem! Loved it since the first time I heard it.
"P.O.S. <SEP> The time length is listed as 34 min , but after approx. 3 min of song it sounds as if the record skips for 30 mins . what a rip off . you can't tell it either from the crappy sample they provided ."
Try to hate it...I dare you <SEP> Catchy. Original. Fresh. Nothing out there like it right now. Take a listen. How to Dress Well is so creative and their music reminds me of so many of many favorite songs.
Thumbs down <SEP> Although I loved the tempo and beat this version's lyrics are too vulgar for my taste.  I just don't like calling Women bitches.
Five Stars <SEP> AWESOME AWESOME REMIX!!!!
"loved the sound <SEP> I loved the music with dylans voice, great!!!, the instrumentation was a moving work of art, need more like that.."
S*** <SEP> I thought this was an iTunes thing. So I bought this fir no reason I guess? I don't listen to music on my phone.
AMAZING <SEP> The song itself has a great quality! And for it beat goes hard af! 10/10. Keep up the good work S3RL.
Five Stars <SEP> Fabulous!
"Lost in Space <SEP> It never made it to my computer!

I don't want to play it in just the cloud player.

I want to download it!"
"Oh dear god... this is awful! DO NOT LISTEN UNLESS YOU WANT TO VOMIT! <SEP> I call my grandmother Me-maw... this is so wrong on so many levels... typed in Me-maw in the search engine just on a whim (looking for Christmas ideas for her) and this hideous and vomit inducing song came up... I knew it would be horrendous just looking at the cover, but like a scab and begs to be picked, I hit the play button on the preview.  VOMIT! The end... Not only is the subject mater sickening... the voices are terrrrrible!!!"
One Star <SEP> Since discovering her music she's definitely one of the best female vocals in this industry.
Five Stars <SEP> HARD!
Dayton Ohio's Motel Beds <SEP> Another great record from a band you should know by now.  Great drum and guitar work compliment the energetic vocals.  Refreshing and approachable fun from a great bunch of guys not taking themselves too seriously.  They ought to be.  All the Ohio record stores are perpetually sold out of this vinyl.  I will check in DC this weekend.
"Belly Dance ""Menazeri"" Music <SEP> This music is hot! Whether you are a Belly Dancer or not it will make you want to move!!!!!!!!!!!! Love this Song! Sexxy!"
"Thes digital sound in this one is awesome, it's hard to find anything New to can ... <SEP> Thes digital sound in this one is awesome, it's hard to find anything New to can start a new type of collection when yours is in the hundreds, but this one is it! I have a brain Damaged son that gets stimulation from sound and this one he lights up!! Sounds great !!"
"POW! <SEP> I think this is their most energy packed album yet. The tunes really put you into a performer's mindset and empower you to either dance or jam. For those who are familiar with their other work, I think they would agree that Beats grew in their knowledge and incorporation of other cultures. Colony Collapse blew my mind."
"Contraption Vol II <SEP> I only have one complaint, so let's get  it out there: this album is too short. Eight songs covering 40 minutes just isn't enough. Technically, it is an ep, but it is a very good one; I want more (a hallmark of excellence?). On Contraption Vol. II Beats Antique continutes to do what they do best: make a cocktail of old world sounds poured over electronic beats, and stir it oh so gently. This latest offering sounds like previous efforts (this is their seventh release in five years) but doesn't fall into the rut of sounding just-like-the-last-album. Most of the songs have a lighter touch of the middle east in them; it is nearly missing on Skeleton Key, and eastern Europe creeps in on a few tracks, most notably Bus to the Balkans. Lynx lends her dreamy vocals of Crooked Muse and the result is remarkable. From haunting to hopping, this albums covers the world(s). In short-pun intended, do your ears a favor: get this."
"Short version <SEP> While musically this version isn't bad, it doesn't go through all five verses.  ""We Three Kings"" without all the verses doesn't tell the story the writer intended to tell."
Really good solo effort <SEP> Fantastic solo effort.  Better than the last 3 or for Bon Jovi albums.
Five Stars <SEP> What a feel good song.
love <SEP> love love love this song
Not the radio mix <SEP> The remix turned out to be different than the one I wanted (radio) and the preview was too short to notice.
Big & Rich <SEP> hillbilly rap  I like the sound
Great Song <SEP> Nice song for movie.
One Star <SEP> not the best singers trying to re-do classic country
Great Single <SEP> Great single with radio edit & remix. I loved both version. Sound quality was great too. Highly recommended as you will never regret buying it.
"Brad got it right <SEP> This challenging piece by Alice in Chains is given new life, and done so with acoustic instrumentation."
Five Stars <SEP> AWESOME
Five Stars <SEP> Yes All good
"Amazing! <SEP> Big & Rich never fail! Everything of theirs is awesome :) I very much enjoy this song, I've been addicted"
Great Song! <SEP> Love this song!
a must have <SEP> Great song and wonderful voices
"On the whole, the compositions are intriguing. <SEP> On tracks 1-3 & 7-10 Mehldau uses dissonance in such a way that he often seems to be hitting wrong notes.  The piano on ""Airegin"" is excellent, but a hyperactive bass and a long drum solo detract from the total effect.  ""Hey Joe"" has never appealed to me, being, after all, a song about murder.  Track 11 is beautiful."
Four Stars <SEP> very nice
"Item wrongly packaged. Instead of the CD ""Where do ... <SEP> Item wrongly packaged.  Instead of the CD ""Where do you start"" by Brad Mehldau I received the CD  ""Big science"" by Laurie Anderson.
I've never asked for a Laurie Anderson CD."
download sucks <SEP> The files I downloaded are not downloading.
One Star <SEP> Did not download the album only one song.
Excellent! <SEP> Excellent!
"It's ok <SEP> I really couldn't get into this album. It didn't have the same energy or momentum of the previous releases. It's ok, but not great."
Five Stars <SEP> Satisfied
"Great artist, great voice and great music <SEP> Great artist, great voice and great music.
However, it is a poor quality recording. Some tracks are defective. Some songs are cut-off."
No One Can Like This Red Liking <SEP> This one it's not WOMAN. It's why they continue to ignore quality of own breasts and continue to compare to their PROFILAKTIKA.
"disappointing <SEP> there is no spark to this music that she showed in leaves eyes. i found it flat, mundane and not good enough to make it to my car ipod music!"
"Not my kind of music <SEP> watched some of his videos on youtube, liked what I saw, bought album through in trash next day, his rap style is same and annoying after a while"
Awesome! <SEP> Makes you feel the oneness under all the sludge!  Their best album since Pack Up the Cats!  And we're waves again...
"Hallelujah! I'm a Bum Local H <SEP> Can't wait to see this done Live in Feb. 13th. What an awesome Early Valentine's Day Present !
I feel like I am Riding the Blue Line,( Or the ""L"" ) and The Songs are simply Stops along the way...
It's a  great Jorney-Thanks for The Ride, Guys ...:-)"
"Not Terribly Great <SEP> BACKGROUND: Having partially grown up during the peak of so-called 'grunge' (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, and bands of that ilk), Local H was one of the first bands I ever listened to. So I've been listening to their music at one point or another for more than 15 years now. Except for 'Here Comes the Zoo', I own all of their major LPs. And while I can't claim that Local H is my absolute favorite band, they are one of the few decisively non-metal bands that I still pay a reasonable amount of attention to.

REVIEW: The album is, in a word, disappointing. To echo the words of another reviewer, calling this a double LP is VERY generous at best and patently false otherwise. If I had to compare this to a previous Local H LP, it would be 'Pack Up the Cats'...the same sort of under-produced sound quality, a lot of useless throw-away tracks, and very few tracks that I would call 'catchy' (i.e. you listen to it once and you immediately like it). At least 'Pack Up...' had very few mediocre-ish tracks on it, however.

1.)Waves - Useless throw-away track that's basically part 1 of the first actual song on the album.
2.)Cold Manor - Part 2 of the first song. Ok/mediocre/largely forgettable. (4.5/10)

3.)Night Flight to Paris - Best track on the album. Catchy. (8.5/10)

4.)They Saved Reagan's Brain - Fairly bad, though a few parts are what I'd call interesting. Listenable I guess. (3.5/10)

5.)Blue Line - Ok. (5.5/10)

6.)Another February - This seemed to be a favorite of other reviewers, but I personally didn't think this was all that special. Ok/mediocre. (5/10)

7.)Say the Word - The other good track on the album. Unfortunately, the better part of the song doesn't come until 2 minutes in. (7.5/10)

8.)Cold and Mannered - Useless throw-away track.

9.)Trash Fire Bummers - Another throw-away. Why this wasn't made into a serious song, I have no idea, because it reasonably could have been.

10.)Feed a Fever - Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)

11.)Here Come Good Ol' Laptop - What I'd call an interesting track and better than average, but not quite 'good'. (6.5/10)

12.)Look Who's Walking... - The country song, and not a terribly good one either. What is this doing on a Local H album? It simply doesn't belong and it was a bad decision by Lucas to include it. Easily the worst track on the album and nearly un-listenable (I admit country isn't my favorite genre, but I don't hate it either).(3/10)

13.)Ruling Kind - Ok/decent. (6/10)

14.)Limit Your Change - Ok/Decent. Unfortunately, it's only about 2 minutes long, so it's kind of another throw-away. (6.5/10)

15.)Paddy Considine - The most amusing track on the album. Actual song length is only about 3:20, however. (6/10)

16.)Sad History - Sort of ballad-ish. Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)

17.)Waves Again - Slowish, but not quite a ballad. Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)

CONCLUSION: Some reviewers have said that many of the tracks on here would have been better suited to Scott Lucas' other band, 'Scott Lucas and the Married Men'. While I can't say for sure (I wasn't impressed by '...Married Men' upon some brief listens), I suspect those reviewers might be on to something. It seems likely that Lucas did indeed cross-pollinate '...Married Men' ideas into this album.
Also, for an album that was promoted as being political, it seems to be far less about politics than one might expect. Even the lyrics that ARE political aren't particularly deep or interesting. I still don't understand what Lucas' overall political message even IS.

Bottom line: this is easily Local H's worst LP to date."
"Not Impressed <SEP> From the snipit I heard, I thought it would be good fro dancing chacha. But the long lead in and irregular beat of the full recording would make that difficult without some serious editing."
"I got nothing for something... <SEP> Bought and paid for this, and one other song, neither one will download, or play."
best song in the world <SEP> One of the best songs on the album..lively and on point..will have you dancing all day and night..very joyful and happy song.. Wonderful classic steel pulse sound..
Greg <SEP> The High Ceilings is a great band. Max Heinegg is a musical genius.  I recommend all thier albums.
Five Stars <SEP> I like it it's part of my music and my time lates 60's
Generally pretty lackluster but there are a couple of high spots ... <SEP> For diehard Deviants fans only.  Generally pretty lackluster but there are a couple of high spots with Police Car and Wayne Kramer's 2 songs.  Less Mick Farren and more band would have made for a better show.
Five Stars <SEP> One of my Mary J faves.
Great <SEP> As expected.
"One Star <SEP> Horrible recording, was misled on the quality of this recording."
Enspiring <SEP> This is a part of my endurace mix floder in my MP3 player. This is a good fit for my long distance rides and runs...
"Best song by this Good Hip Hop group <SEP> I personally guarantee that if you are truly a hip hop fan, you will love this song from the second you hit PLAY!"
Try Again <SEP> Not nearly as good as her previous CDs. The songs all sounded pretty much the same...and they all sounded whine-y.
"Amazon Downloads: Horrible <SEP> The way the song downloads to your computer is awful and I don't know how to put it into my itunes library!!!
AWFUL"
Five Stars <SEP> This recording has received a diapason d'or award.
Well preserved. I am thankful. <SEP> I was so happy when it arrived in good quality.
"No ending?????? <SEP> I've been looking for this audio (complete version) for a while and when I found it at Amazon, I thought ""finally!"". But nope, it was just like other copies out there with the repeat of part three and no ending (but at least I got them for free on Youtube, for instance). I don't have any issues paying for what I want to get, but imagine you read a book or watch a movie without the endings? It's a kill joy. This was my first time purchasing an mp3 on Amazon and, well, hopefully, next time will be a success, if there is one.

Five Stars <SEP> Fun Song!
Finally!!! <SEP> Tim McGraw tried to go a different route with his music and this song finally brings back his country sound we all love.
McGraw <SEP> Not a fan of Mr. McGraw but I really liked this song after my nephew forced me to listen to it about 6 times.  Couldnt get it out of my head.
"Great new talent <SEP> I saw this artist on a PBS special, where I usually find good new (and old) music that I love. If you like Josh Groban, Russell Watson, Il Divo, etc. you will enjoy Nathan Pacheco. I have asked for the complete album for Christmas."
"Good if it's for free. <SEP> I got this song for free. But I wouldn't pay for it and I don't even listen to it, since I have the same song sung by Corelli, Pavaroti, etc."
"Nessun Dorma <SEP> I was disappointed in this recording.  I love the song, but Pacheco's voice leaves a lot to be desired.  It sounds very weak and immature compared to others I have heard."
"Caught my eye <SEP> Heard the song and liked it very much. Also, can't beat the price--free! Thanks. Love Amazon's mp3 section and the ease of downloads."
Good pairing <SEP> Carly and Justin's voices sound good together. Song is also a little different from all the fast paced dance songs she does.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it.
horrible!! <SEP> Uhhhh.....horrible!!!
"Possibly her best one yet <SEP> Oh Carly Rae. Call Me Maybe drove me crazy after a while. I actually prefer Tonight I'm Getting Over You. It's such a catchy tune, and the lyrics tell a story we can ALL relate to. I've been listening for a while, and it has not driven me crazy as of yet."
Seki a <SEP> Feel good music.
"Proud Home-owner in Hershey, PA <SEP> I've listened to this CD a few times, now (bought on iTunes), and have found ""Home"" to be light, original, and easy on the ears. Think Jack Johnson on a ukulele, or an Andrew Bird who knows how to enunciate when he sings.

Honestly, NPR is my program of choice for my morning commute. I don't own a radio outside of my car, and I'd been sitting on an iTunes gift card for a year and a half. (I'm fairly picky, when it comes to music.) A friend referred me to ""Home,"" and I'm proud to say I spent my .. parent's? sister's? parent-in-law's? money well (sorry, relative, in-law, or whoever). Listen to the previews! It will be worth your time."
the most real that will hit you in a long time <SEP> All I can say is WOW I am thoroughly stuck on this album. I am so proud to have a completely signed shirt that will adorn my tea shop
"October Gold <SEP> I know these musicians and they are very talented and always give their heart and soul into their music.
I especially love their songs entitled ""Being On The Road"""" and ""Snow Ghosts."
Would like to have returned it as it runs too slow ... <SEP> Would like to have returned it as it runs too slow and when I speed it up this does not work so well.
Five Stars <SEP> Nice line dance song

Five Stars <SEP> love it my granddaugther dose too
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful music
"Fresh music <SEP> Blackmill's music is consistently refreshing, and this single is no different.  These electronic/synth vibes operate in defiance of the formulaic music of the top 40, and for that I am thankful."
Ok <SEP> It wasn't what I was expecting.
Love it <SEP> great song by great artists. sound is really quality clear. I would buy again if I could. Love it much.
"didn't even know about it until now <SEP> I wish I had known of this one before! I don't know how I missed it but I only just discovered it when I learned of their newest single just released! anyway, both are great and it's about time they made their comeback! they NEVER should've left! they hadn't done enough yet!"
"Stale. <SEP> Orgy used to have a cool and mostly unique sound. This isn't a terrible song but it's incredibly generic and ultimately forgettable. I've listened to it numerous times and nothing stays with me. I probably wouldn't recognize it if I heard it played any other time than when I choose to put it on. The only remaining element of the classic Orgy lineup is Jay Gordon, the lead vocalist, and it shows. The clever lyrics and synth hooks of Orgy's heyday are replaced here by a goofy intro noise, generic radio riffs, and unremarkable lyrics delivered with dispassionate and tired vocals.

I was a huge fan of Orgy's first two albums but the downhill slope started with ""Punk Statik Paranoia"" and this track shows that the downward momentum is still at full speed and Jay can't find the brakes. I know bands change, but they usually retain some core element that keeps you interested. Whatever you're looking for isn't here. Give ""Candyass"" or ""Vapor Transmission"" another spin and pass on this track."
LOVE IT <SEP> ORGY IS ONE OF MY FAV BANDS AND IVE BEEN WAITING FOR NEW MUSIC AND JAY'S VOICE WELL IT'S BBBBBAAAAACCCKKK AND JUST AS GREAT!!!
"GREAT GROUP THAT HOOKED UP <SEP> CHRIS BROWN & FAT JOE classic.
I love to listen to this.
It is on my mp3, which I listen to at the gym

great price"
"Five Stars <SEP> ""Hold on to the dream!""
I remember this from the Usain Bolt documentary."
Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic
"A pretentious meandering <SEP> Dear oh dear. 'Fraid to say I cannot agree with any of these 5 star reviews. I've tried to like BBT, I really have. But they are a BBB (Big Big Bore) to me. I'll concede they can play - but that's about it. Musically they are devoid of any inspiration outside of their lame channeling of Gabriel era Genesis, but without any of the memorable melodies of yore. Much instrumental noodling but little else. In fact, I find it impossible to commit any of their meandering compositions to memory, so insipid are their attempts at writing a good tune. Predictable chordings rapidly become irritating, rendering the tracks effectively indistinguishable from one other. And lyrically - I'm not sure what to say. The constant repetition of banal lines with ever increasing accompaniment, as if the very process of doing this could somehow magically transform dross into something profound and meaningful. A typical example (from the tweely entitled Winchester from St Giles Hill):
""A river flowing from the chalk hills
through the water meadows and the open fields.
Walls were made and streets were laid down,
halls and houses, schools and churches""
Yikes! To commit this atrocity to paper is bad enough, but then to put it to melody (or what passes in the BBT world as melody) just adds insult to injury. If their musical modus operandi is to try and force a tune around lyrics such as these, no wonder they're mired in the land of anal retention.
Just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on the guys, I picked another track at random (British Racing Green from Far Skies, Deep Time). No luck here, either. Here's an unfortunate and feeble attempt at pathos, marred by yet another forgettable tune and kindergarten lyrics. To wit:
""British racing green and red,
She looked at me.
We tore each others hearts out.
We ripped each other apart.
We tore each others hopes up,
We just gave up.
Gave up.""

Frankly, so have I !!
Now where's my Selling England By The Pound?"
Fun <SEP> It's fun
Worth a listen! <SEP> This song really makes you think of the best parts of a spring or summer shower.
Not the One <SEP> This was not the same song I heard on Pandora.  It is disappointing and I will need to be more cautious when selecting music. The price was only 99cents but it was still not what I wanted.
"No vocals <SEP> I love the Cillo Vocal Dubstep version of Breathe, but this is instrumental only. No vocals. Not what I wanted."
Money well spent! <SEP> Money well spent!
Loved it <SEP> Highly recommend at bedtime.  Helps place the mind at rest
One Star <SEP> sounds like a tape loop to me very boring
"disappointed <SEP> I spent 9 dollars on 35 songs that are basically 2 1/2 minutes long. I felt I got ripe off.

When buying threw my amazon mp3 app, it doesn't show the length of each song!!#

Instrument songs should at least be 5 to 6 minutes long.  I wsnt my Money Back !"
"I knew Justiniano, he was a friend of mine. <SEP> Justi was a master Rumbero and a a master Abacua.
He could converse in Lucum&iacute; ( the language of the Yorubas in Africa ) and &Ntilde;a&ntilde;igo ( the language of the Secret African Society of Cuba - he was an O&ntilde;a&ntilde;ofo ).
His knowledge of the customs and the music was full and complete; it was part of his DNA.
They don't make them like him anymore.

El Cojonuo from Ma&ntilde;ia&ntilde;ao"
"Two Stars <SEP> Terrible, don't waste your money."
"another double-set Beach Boys best-of <SEP> Golden Harmonies was apparently released in '85, and was yet another double-set (in its vinyl form) Beach Boys compilation. (Other BB double-set comps included Endless Summer, Spirit Of America, Sunshine Dream, and Ten Years Of Harmony.) This collection was also released on cassette, which is the version I own (the cassette version doesn't seem to be listed at Amazon; I'm assuming that the tracklisting was the same on the vinyl release). While it has many songs that you can find on just about any BB best-of out there, it also has some that don't appear very often (including a few ""live"" cuts), which I think is kind of cool. I wouldn't call it a GREAT collection, but it's certainly better than all of those skimpy, ten-tracks-or-so comps that have been put out. Here is a listing of the tracks (in the order they appear in on the comp):

Help Me Rhonda (the album version from Beach Boys Today!, not the single version, which I think is better)
Dance, Dance, Dance
When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)
Johnny B. Goode (live track from Beach Boys Concert album)
Fun, Fun, Fun (stereo album version from Shut Down Vol. 2)
Keep An Eye On Summer
409
Pet Sounds (a good track, but seems kind of out-of-place in this collection)
Little Deuce Coupe
Do You Wanna Dance
Sloop John B.
Shut Down
Surfin' U.S.A.
The Little Old Lady From Pasadena (from Beach Boys Concert; the best live track here)
The Wanderer (from Beach Boys Concert)
Surfin'

However, this collection still isn't as good overall as many of the bigger comps that have been released (including the abovementioned double-set ones); hence my low rating."
There is no better. <SEP> Modern blues at its best. Bonamassa is a guitar virtuoso whose music will revered for generations.
Awesome <SEP> Awesome!!!!!!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> good tune
"John Hiatt and Joe Bonamassa - what can I say? <SEP> A great pairing - John Hiatt's haunting vocals singing ""Down Around My Place"" (the best song on his ""Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns"" album) paired with Joe Bonamassa's equally haunting and soaring guitar.  Highly worth downloading just this one song, although Bonamassa's performance at the Beacon Theater (from which this song was taken) is a tremendous performance as well.

Hiatt is one of the best songwriters of the last 30 years (even if you haven't heard him, you've heard his music recorded by everyone from Buddy Guy to Aerosmith).  His voice is tremendous on songs like this - the ache, shame, pain, and age resonate perfectly.  Bonamassa is truly one of the greatest rock/blues guitarists of the early 2000s.

Highly, highly recommended."
i love this song <SEP> i love this song! it's not on the 'bend it like beckham' soundtrack and i was thrilled to find it here on amazon. her voice is amazing and it conveys such emotion. i loop this on auto play when i need a boost.
Two Stars <SEP> i like it
Five Stars <SEP> Karen is a very skilled an funny comic
Any song devoted to the guitar legend is worth a ... <SEP> Any song devoted to the guitar legend is worth a listen. It rocks hard and tosses out references to White touchstones such as the Ash Grove and Appalachian Swing.
Five Stars <SEP> GREAT SONG!
Awesome song! <SEP> This is an awesome song from a great band out of Salt Lake City Utah.
"The audio quality on this CD was so bad that I sent it back <SEP> Big surprise. The audio quality on this CD was so bad that I sent it back. I have other recordings of Sergio Assad and, like his playing, it is first rate. I still can't quite believe Sony would let this out the door with their name on it."
"Don't buy this CD-R release! <SEP> Before I get to the important point, I'd like to state that I own all of Kiko Loureiro's CDs and find ""Sounds of Innocence"" to be the best one of his rock/metal releases, because on this album his riffing ideas and his songwriting ideas complement each other better than ever before. I like ""Universo Inverso"" best of all his releases though. And ""Neural Code"" shouldn't be discarded either.

That being said I urge you not to buy this Amazon.com CD-R release.

I bought it myself because I didn't realize it was such a release. I didn't even know Amazon.com does CD-Rs. But it was a great price and in Europe there were only overpriced offers available.

When I got the CD-R, the first thing I realized was that there is no real booklet, just an inlay included. Next thing I noticed was that track 2 is not stereo but mono! Imagine that. That's when I revisited this site to check if that could be intentional and that's when I learned that it's a CD-R, made by Merry Music for Amazon.com.

Meanwhile I've got an original CD from Brasil (from 2012, not the 2014 re-release) and can say that these are not the only flaws that come with this CD-R.

The original comes with a real booklet, the intro is 20 seconds longer and all the tracks sound much better than on the CD-R. And that's not even counting the ""mono track"".

So, do yourself and your ears a favour and don't buy this CD-R release. You might save a few bucks now, but you'll reget it from the first listen on."
"Can't open the download <SEP> I've gotten other downloads from Amazon and they worked fine, but the last two I've bought won't open so they do me no good.  I've been able to find them at other places so I'm now going to them for my music.  Don't know what's changed lately, but it's just not working for me now."
"I Just Wanna....get my money back! <SEP> Another horrible, heavily auto tuned song. The reason she can't sing live is because she can't sing...period. ""that saved a wench like me"" is not going to make you a singing sensation. If you sang songs remotely even in your range, you would have a better chance. She takes it way too seriously. Thats the different between u and Zolciaks. At least she admits that she sucks, but just wante to have fun. What's up with all the young clubbing songs, skanky clothes and suggestive dances? I know you are all about fun, but you are a mother first and foremost. How embarassing for yournkids. *shudder*

This was a gag gift from a friend and is not even worth the 99cents. I know it's less than a dollar, but the inability to hold the tune, sing 8 bars without dubbing them in because of your lung capacity, and the raucous beat make me want a refund...for my friends sake. Save your ears folks. Before you pitch your money in the trash, think again. PS: Who buys this crap?"
"The best...party song <SEP> This is the best, perfect song for fright night! I added it to my Halloween scary music & sound collection to play Halloween night and parties to get the dogs howling & the kids screaming when they hear her sing! The owner of a haunted house & maze wants to borrow it for their event but doesn't want to be liable for ears being chopped off! Instead of covering their eyes, they'll be covering their ears! I'll be playing this many years to come at Halloween or even to play a nasty joke on friends and enemies,  gets them in that terrified, nightmarish, ears pounding and bleeding, shivers down you're back, hair raising, don't turn around mood! It's like walking into a spider web you didn't see, the kind where you flap your arms around like a psycho and sputter trying to get it out of your mouth or face. Or that old faithful scary movie scene but in real life,  walking into a dark room and asking ""did you hear that"" ""was that a dog growling?"" ""what is that noise it's making my ears hurt & bleed!"" ""Stop running your nails down the chalkboard!!"" ""who's grinding their teeth?"" Remember as a kid not looking under the bed or in the closet bc you're you too scared? Listen to this song and it takes you right back to that moment of paralyzed fear, covers pulled up to your chin, eyes squeezed shut and cotton in your ears, can't wait till sunlight comes feeling. Instead of scaring everyone with the undead  scare them with the ""I just wanna wanna wanna UNHEAR!"" screams arrrgghhhh!!! Add the video and Frankantino and the back up singing witch of the east dancing the herky jerky, flashing strobe light, ghouls & boys dancing in the background will take the fear factor to a whole new level! You'll never want to listen to your mp3 player again! ever.again. worse than the chupracabra, bloody mary or clowns. You'll nev... regret it."
Hilariously bad! <SEP> This isn't just kinda bad - it's almost hilarious how bad this is! The auto tune is just too much. I don't see what's the point of bothering to make a single if you need to completely cover it up with auto tune.
"I just wanna..... <SEP> I just wanna.... pretend i never heard this crap!! the song is pretty catchy but its corny its one of those songs you find your self singing but would never admit it to any of your friends, but the girl cannot sing!! I know a lot of artist use auto tune, and there are artist out there that I don't necessarily think can sing like britney spears or kesha to name a few, but they also have a certain star quality that I don't think Melissa has.  Overall like I said the song was cathy but she CAN't sing and even though I do think this song is better than On Display I wouldn't waste my money on it."
fizzle <SEP> I couldn't even finish listening to it. I'd rather listen to Adele or Lady Gaga. Her song would be ok playing in a bar on the dance floor after a few drinks though. I think she will fizzle out.
"Bad Autotune! <SEP> It would be amazing if Melissa would just go away!  She is delusional to think that she is a singer, and to pay to make a video?  No one wants to see her!  Anyone could sound like a barely passable singer with that much auto tune going on.  I Just Wanna have her go away!"
"Didn't like <SEP> She sings through her nose. Track mixed awesome, catchy tune, she just kept singing through her nose and as catchy as the song is, I didn't like it"
"NOT A REAL SINGER! <SEP> Does Melissa not understand that people work their butts off for years to become REAL singers and not use auto tune? This is an insult to any real music lover. You can't expect to make a career out of singing because your related to someone famous. Stop ripping people off because your not actually singing like this. I woudnt waste 99 cents on this, I will donate it to the poor instead!"
"Song skips like an 80's discman <SEP> At first I thought it may be some new kind of metal that I am just not hip to, but after listening to the song several times, I am sure that it is just a issue with the track itself.  I would love to download the song again but I am not interested in paying for it if it is just going to skip again."
"Joe Blessett "" Changnig Everything"" <SEP> Changing Everything is more about what you expect out of Jazz.  Blessett creates on a palette both rare and refined, cross musical boundaries at a whim and whipping up combinations that are different, progressive, unique and yes, sometimes uncomfortable.  At the same time, he retains respect for the classics, and is equally able to produce commercial consumable jazz from most any generation.  Changing Everything lives up to its name and then some.  Blessett is all about rebirth, renewal and in the end, pure creation.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Changing-Everything/dp/B0096G3OTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Changing Everything</a>"
Steven Halpern fan. <SEP> Excellent sound quality. Great value with the purchase of physical copy and digital copy is included.
"just great, great music <SEP> Musically dense...adventurous, expands on the ""Tulsa Sound"" of yesterday and captures the vibe and energy of the new Tulsa sound. just great, great music. Love this!"
Gaden of shadows <SEP> Great vocals from midnight. Midnight passed away in 2009 from organ failure. Crimson glory are by far one of the greatest bands alive. Midnight may you rest in peace.
"Dig it!!! Laid-back groove with a lot of melody <SEP> This one is my favorite on the album, for sure.  It's so sad, but uplifting at the same time.  I love it!!"
Four Stars <SEP> Nice music.
"JUST ONE OF THE BEST CCM SONGS EVER!!! <SEP> Everything the enemy wants you to believe about Our Heavenly Father is NOT true.  REALLY coming to God as a human can be so intimidating...that's why i LOVE that God used it and still uses it mightily and powerfully, as in Zephaniah 3:17

  the Mighty Warrior who saves.
He will take great delight in you;
  in his love he will no longer rebuke you,

LIARS <SEP> THIS SONG DOES NOT HAVE SALT N PEPA INVOLVED OR A HINT OF THEIR VOICES IN IT. YOU HAVE/ARE DECEIVING PEOPLE
"What happened? <SEP> Are they rerecording as 50 year olds? Wow. This is not like the original, sounds similar, but the whole feel of it is not there. I was very disappointed by the song, looking now for the original version, NOT the rerecorded ""remastered"" (failed) version."
"Great comeback <SEP> This is a single track demo (of studio quality) for the return of Crimson Glory -- an early progressive rock/metal band featuring layers of sound.  The band may be remembered by some as the group that wore long dark clothing, red capes and silver masks in their early videos.

This particular song is a return to the earlier sound of melodious singer Midnight, as opposed to the high focus of Wade Black on Astronomica.  The song features the many layers of guitars, bass, keys and drums and showcases the talents of guitarist Jon Drenning.  More of a mid-tempo song, the track has plenty of changes to keep your interest.

Overall a fine return to form.  Hopefully it won't take quite so long to complete the entire album as it did for Astronomica!"
"Too simple for my tastes <SEP> The guitar playing is adequate, but the songs aren't really arranged--more like sitting around a campfire style than listening to a concert."
Nice background music. <SEP> Nice background music.
"Tacky and not enjoyable - <SEP> I ordered these songs and they were tacky and not enjoyable.  The songs were also not versatile as I imagined, so their usefulness was greatly diminished.  I would not recommend buying this."
"Former Reno resident of great upbeat music <SEP> I wish I had a CD of your cassette. Very fun to listen to for all us old geisers.  Young people would like this also.  If you have any CD's, please email jjjkkkbbb6@sbcglobal.net."

One Star <SEP> you get what you pay for :)
sorry I bought this <SEP> Should have known better than to buy music without hearing samples.  Not my kind of music.  Will give this to the thrift store.
"Great Music <SEP> This album is terrific for chilling out and reading, chilling out and conversing with friends, or for chilling out and listening deeply."
"00 for about 10 minutes worth of content makes todays music industry look like Robin Hood <SEP> This is an example of not reading the reviews before purchasing.  I thought there would be more on this CD, a lot more.  When I looked to see the list of downloads available, I though the 30+ seconds  was just a sample, a sound bite, not the entire length of a track.  $9.00 for about 10 minutes worth of content makes todays music industry look like Robin Hood..."
"What a waste of money <SEP> What a waste of hard earned money, last about 15 min and was very disappointing even my lovebird was upset:-). Lesson learned I quess...."
not good quality <SEP> this is a rinky dink version of the fight song. Not good sound quality...sounds like a kids auto book:( let down
"finch?... or wren?? <SEP> I haven't listened to this track. But I hope the recording is more accurate than the accompanying photo. This is a wren, not a house finch. Makes me doubt the reliability of the recording."

"Nice, but not as good as past material <SEP> I love Tina Dico's sound and have enjoyed all her past CD's. This CD is good, but it is not quite the Tina I grew to love. Still, if you are a fan it is a must have."
"Excellent interpretation and option <SEP> The only piccolo version of these Fantasies. For flutists it is a must have. The technique of Mr. Findon is superb. Pity it is not on a CD, but I burned my own."

"Huge Tina Dico fan <SEP> I love Tina Dico but this album is very somber. It'll probably grow on me, but maybe not. My fave is Welcome Back Color.

Of course, every artist should have the freedom to make an album in keeping with her/his mood. I remain the same huge fan, just not of this album.

If you're feeling down and remote, Where Do You Go to Disappear might be perfect for you. It's got the same excellent production values as all her music."

Transformation. . so good. <SEP> I love this song. It's home for me. Love his silky voice.
"What the critcs say <SEP> Although the album was released by a company usually associated with blues, Andrzej Serafin's music definitely differs from this quite narrow genre. This extremely talented vibraphonist and pianist succeeded in creating an intimate and a chamber music album joining jazz, blues and rock into a splendid union of sounds.

This unusual orchestra, its beautiful themes and interesting solo parts (especially the harmonica ones) make up for one of the most extraordinary albums on Polish music scene of 2010.

However, the question about classifying it into a particular trend or style should not be asked for this music slips out from any categorization in a truly swift way.

- Michal Wilczynski. Musical Magazine LIZARD 1/2011

*****

There aren't many virtuoso performances and impromptu party on this record; however we can find here carefully arranged music, full of interesting sounds, often combined in surprising ways. I think that even if the team did not reinvent the wheel, they've showed something fresh and new.

This album has been recorded by artists from different musical worlds: vibraphonist Andrzej Serafin, playing on harmonica Robert Lenert and - known from Movement Evolution's albums - jazz saxophonist Stanislaw Domarski. On LSD we can find nine blues pieces. Apart from Deep River all of them are composed by Robert Lenert.

This album made a lot of confusion among polish blues fans. Serafin has proven several times that he doesn't like to close himself in one specific convention. That's why we can hear jazz influences and a spirit of ambient atmosphere in his music.  I'm listeting to LSD with increasing pleasure, discovering new relishes. The only caveat which arises is that the album is a little short. Every time while listening to the last song I feel sad that it's the end. That's why only 4  star.

Five Stars <SEP> This is a good song to sing to booster faith for healing.
A must-have in your Christmas music collection! <SEP> This dramatic piece is a lovely addition to traditional Christmas carols.  The Washington Chorus performs beautifully with such passion and clarity.
"I want my money back on this one <SEP> This is a cover track which is a awful, wish I could return it."

"Albums Heart made in the 80s/90s are way, way better. This one...hardy listenable. <SEP> Even worse than Red Velvet Car IMO, as a 40 year fan, not a good album."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"Does Sweden have any bands that aren't awesome? <SEP> I'll admit I was first attracted to Conflagrator from the album cover. These guys looked badass and had that 80's thrash vibe going on. I dug the preview tracks and for $3 why not support a new band?

I was quite pleased and surprised by this EP. Great guitar work and the vocals are awesome. Reminds me of Beneath The Remains by Sepultura at times.

Apocryphal Deluge is definitely the highlight on this EP. I have always been a fan of long thrash songs. At 10:10 it gives you three minutes of great guitars before the vocals kick in.

So it turns out my initial thoughts were correct. These guys kick ass and I can't wait to hear more from them."
"Worst Scooter guest vocal ever <SEP> Horrible generic female techno voice opens up this track and keeps telling us how she is lighting up her cigarette. HP Baxxster needs to get back with the DJs who made Scooter shine. Every time this woman tells us about her cigarettes, I want to slap about 10 nicotine patches over her mouth so she'll shut up.

Get the album release (Music for a Big Night Out) instead, there are some killer tracks there like What Time is Love?, Army of Hardcore, and Too Much Silence. This should not have been a single."
"Great song by Mud <SEP> A great hard-rock song by Mud.  So far the three best songs I found from Mud were:  Rocket,  Dyna-Mite  and Tiger Feet.  A great background music for physical work and physical exercise.  It keeps you full of energy."
"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! <SEP> This album is long over due....she has one of the most AMAZING VOICES that God has blessed us with.  She is so underrated and in my opinion without voices like hers all we would have to listen to is one hit wonders.  Her lyrics are true, from the heart and can touch anyone (man or woman, gay or heterosexual).  I have each and everyone of her albums (That's right all 5) 6 if you include Accoustic Soul Sessions and I am a true FAN!  I have never seen her live face to face but that will all change come December 22, 2012 when I will have the PRIVILEGE of seeing Mrs. Johnson live on stage at Blues Alley in Washington, DC.  If you can go and see her I promise you you will not be disappointed.  I CAN'T WAIT!"
Two Stars <SEP> Not a fan of copies
One Star <SEP> Not a very good cover of the original. Disappointed
"4 AM review <SEP> I thought I would like this song since I like most songs by Scooter but I don't  and wish I had not purchased it.  On my part, I feel I have wasted my money.  Music is so personal that even though I don't like it at all, that doesn't mean that someone won't like it either.  If you like Scooter, try Jump That Rock or Maria (I like it loud)."
"Worst recording of any album ever <SEP> I am not writing about the musical content of this album merely the recording. I love Heather's discography in general but this recording is atrocious. If you are at all familiar with the dynamic range issue of music you will appreciate what I am talking about. First get your self a copy of ""Audacity"". Rip this album (with EAC maybe) and look at the tracks in Audacity. First, everything is pegged at 0.0 dB )OK -0.1dB). Since when does a female singer with a guitar needs to sound as loud as AC/DC? Second there is NO dynamic range at all it is just solid sound - Phil Spector would be proud. For goodness sake, when will artists take the time to look at what the production people release to the public. This is just crap. For good recordings look to Pink Floyd, King Crimson etc. I just bought Donovan ""Troubadour"" from the early 90's - now that is how you present music. AP"
lively tune <SEP> I like this upbeat tune that isn't too repetetive.  I enjoy the saxaphone with the background music.  Wish I could just give it stars and not have to write all this.
"One Star <SEP> This version is NOT the Coliseum Club Mix, it is just a standard album version."
Five Stars <SEP> I could listen to this all day!!
"Mahler mauled <SEP> A truly beautiful set of the Kindertotenlied.  But there is an error in track 8 where one is suddenly launched into ""The Swan of Tuonela"".  Whoops.  Wrong composer for the download and the piece at hand.  This kind of mistake kills the enjoyment of the whole download."
I was expecting a great R & B album...but instead.... <SEP> Very disappointed. Selena has a diamond voice but fell into the unfortunate cycle of letting little children produce a grown woman's music so that the album sounds like it wants to be something it is not.  HATED IT.
"simple & refreshing <SEP> This is what soul music should be all about, it reminds me of the 60's throwback and nice clean smiple & refreshing sound."
"Poor Mozart Phrasing <SEP> I have a real soft spot for ""Finta"" -- it's a gem of the Mozart repertoire, and too often overlooked for flaws that have more to do with the historical period it was set in than its young composer.  It was an ambitious and wildly creative undertaking for teenaged Mozart... One turn-off to modern audiences is the standard opera form (aria. recit. aria. recit. another ABA aria... remember, Mozart revolutionized operatic form later in life!) and it's 'Pamela' story line, which for the uninitiated is something like a bastardization of the familiar Cinderella tale: a noble woman is torn violently from her high station, but risen back up to glory because of her *noble* heart.

Don't let any of that turn you away; the plot and set-up may be a little dated, but this opera features two (!) multi-sectional finales, and Mozart's first experiments in melding the Seria and Buffo theatre characters. There's good stuff here. However...

THIS RECORDING HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES. The singers are fairly strong, but the tempi are all over the place, the recits inconsistent in style, and the phrasing is absolutely abysmal --  you'll leave it after 15 min feeling like you'd been stuck inside a turbulent aircraft. At the very least someone should have told Jacobs that the old line about ""Mozart has three tempi -- fast, faster, and fastest"" is just that: a joke. Listener, you'd be better off purchasing the Hager or Harnoncourt recordings."
"A Failed Assault on K 196 <SEP> More obviously than usual, this review of mine is a failure. Under the circumstances it's understandable enough. It warrants an allegory.

In 1995 upon its arrival at Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft released a probe that descended into the gas giant itself. It lasted 58 minutes before it was crushed by a combination of pressure (230G!) and temperature. Indeed, it is amazing that it lasted that long given that it had shed 80kg of its heat-shield in the initial entry.

Dedicated Mozartian though I be, I find it arduous to listen to La Finta Giardiniera at the best of times. It's a strange work. Worse still, it lacks a definitive recording. For whatever reason (budget cuts?) Hager was deprived of his usual stable (Mathis, Cotrubas and Auger) when he recorded it in the early Seventies.

Here, I lost most of my heat-shield in the Overture. I find Rene Jacobs and his beloved Freiburg Barockorchestra to be an acquired taste. The Junk Yard Dog might enjoy them but there's nothing to say that I have to follow suit. How anyone could ascribe this lumpy, graceless, grit-like muesli to Mozart is beyond me. This is a mere stab in the dark in terms of guessing what an orchestra of his day might have sounded. Moreover, the additional wind-parts are clearly not from Mozart's hand: they obfuscate the texture so why use them? From there, I listened to the opening ensemble where it's clear that Jacobs has assembled his usual array of light-voiced B-grade singers. As the g-forces amassed in ""Dentro il mio petto io sento"" (given his chronic lack of projection, Nicolas Rivenq won't be household name anytime soon) I hit the kill-switch.  A man's gotta know his limitations.

One of the prerogatives of being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association is my dictatorial powers. Come our next meeting, I'll be calling for an intrepid, hard-headed volunteer to step forward from the ranks and risk oblivion."
"Revealing Interpretation <SEP> La Finta Giardiniera shows Mozart on the edge of genius. It is a traditional opera buffo, with a pre-set libretto which Mozart could not adapt. The libretto is long on farce and short on human sympathy or empathy. Mozart was undoubtedly hindered by having only a reputedly limited and lack-lustre orchestra available. La Finta Giardiniera is nevertheless a remarkable work, Mozart using music to overcome many of the libretto's shortcomings and presenting ideas that later -- especially in the Marriage of Figaro -- the composer would rocket into the operatic firmament. Nevertheless, the opera bombed at its initial production and lived on mainly as a Singspiel in German translation.

Jacobs' recording features a version with much fuller orchestral arrangement than the original, produced in Prague late in the 18th century. Who made the arrangement and why is unknown, but it matches Mozart's later style very well and certainly enriches the opera. Jacobs produces a hard-driven version using young, highly talented and engaged performers with a first class orchestra and chorus. This makes for an exciting and highly enjoyable set. The concentration is on the drama more than on the lovely music. This is particularly evident in the recitatives secco where if anything overacting is evident. These are accompanied by a forte piano on steroids. Initially, this is amusing, soon it becomes irritating, and ends by being infuriating.

I suppose the main cd  rival to this set must be the version featuring Harnoncourt. This set of course uses the original orchestration -- or so one presumes. It is weaker for that reason, but not seriously so. Harnoncourt of course uses his Concentus Musicus Wien, and I think that Jacobs Freiburger Barockorchester produces a much more pleasing sound. Jacobs is recorded with a brighter sound than Harnoncourt. Both conductors have their quirks, but over all I prefer Harnoncourt whose slightly more relaxed approach allows for the beauty of the music to shine through better. Harnoncourt has a more distinguished cast, and on balance this counts strongly for him, but Jacobs' singers are more exciting. Harnoncourt's recitatives are much more attractive than Jacobs' and that swings the balance to him in my opinion. However, I would not be without either set. I expect to keep listening to both -- but more frequently to Harnoncourt than to Jacobs."
"""My Praguers Understand Me"" <SEP> After finding less-than-stellar receptions of many of his later operas in Vienna, Mozart found the audiences of Prague to be far more welcoming.  He is believed to have said, ""Meine Prager verstehen mich"" - my Praguers understand me.  Eight Mozart operas enjoyed fame in Prague, most of which are familiar to listeners today:  Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, Idomeneo, Der Schauspieldirektor, Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Cosi fan Tutte, La Clemenza di Tito, Die Zauberflte, and the present La finta giardiniera.  The publishers in Prague are largely responsible for the dissemination of Mozart's operas to the rest of Europe, helping to cement Mozart's name as an opera composer for posterity.  Of these operas, Der Schauspieldirektor and La finta giardiniera are the only ones which have not become part of the standard repertoire.  This is unfortunate, as La finta giardiniera is a stellar example of the transition of a child prodigy into a mature composer.

La finta giardiniera has perhaps the most troubled history of any Mozart opera.  The 18-year-old Mozart wrote it for performances in Munich.  He and his father wrote home to their family in Salzburg that the opera had been a success, but in reality it had been ""hissed"" and received only a few performance, at least one of which was drastically shortened.  In 1779, Mozart had the libretto translated from Italian to German, cut the recitatives, and performed it as a Singspiel, Die vestellte Grtnerin.  The Italian version, subsequently, went lost until its rediscovery in the mid 20th century.  However, a few years after Mozart's death in 1791, a few versions of La finta giardiniera were floating around Prague, versions which expanded Mozart's scant early orchestra to proportions more familiar to Mozart's later operas.  Rene Jacobs has chosen to record the version dubbed the Namest edition of circa 1796-97.

A word about the version Rene Jacobs has chosen.  If re-orchestrations of beloved works make you queasy for so perversely distracting the listener from the original composer's intentions (e.g. Mozart's arrangements of Hndel's oratorios or Mendelssohn's arrangements of Bach's passions), such concerns are very much not present here.  Various scholars since the early 20th century have remarked on the quality and sensitivity that the heretofore anonymous arranger of the Namest edition ""touched up"" the youthful Mozart score.  At least one scholar suggested that the Namest edition originated from a version in Mozart's own hand (more details are available in the liner notes).  Those familiar with the original will find the 18-year-old Mozart used a rather thin orchestra-common for Munich in the mid-1770s but rather dull compared to the character of Mozart's later operas.  However, even though the Namest arranger added clarinets, flutes, trumpets and timpani to match the forces of Mozart's mature works, he did so with such sensitivity to Mozart's compositional style that he was undoubtedly a connoisseur of the late composer's music, adding tasteful and skillful Mozartian counterpoint here and there.  We have here an arrangement of La finta giardiniera that is not distracting, but within the character of late Mozart.  It adds a new meaning to the above quote attributed to the late composer.

Among the changes implemented were substantial interweaving of woodwinds throughout (it adds clarinets, bassoons, flutes, trumpets, timpani.  The original relies mostly on bare strings supplemented by oboes), expansion of the viola section, and shortening of the lengthy instrumental introductions for several arias (an outmoded Baroque practice which Mozart's almost completely eschewed in his mature operas because it detracted too much from the forward thrust of drama).  What we are left with is a La finta giardiniera as we would expect a mature Mozart to have written.  One is tempted to think this is what Mozart might have done with La finta giardiniera/Die verstellte Grtnerin had he revisited it in his later years (indeed, Mozart was no stranger to revising his own operas; he translated the present opera, rewrote chunks of Don Giovanni and Idomeneo, and intended another major rewrite of Idomeneo which never came to fruition).  The three finales here are especially striking, as they have been orchestrated to sound akin to the finales Mozart wrote for the famous Da Ponte operas: Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cosi.  Even in the original version, you can very much hear in the Act I and II finales Mozart's attempts at complex, extended ensembles without recitatives-forshadowing the great Act II finale of Figaro.  The Namest arranger has brought Le finta giardiniera even closer to Figaro's sound world.

Turning now to the merits of the recording itself, Rene Jacobs has surprised us again.  This La finta giardiniera is not a set that is merely for the Mozart completist; rather it is delightfully listenable thanks to forward thrust of action (due in part to the Namest arranger, due in part to Rene Jacobs's conducting and his soloists).  It is a recording that can easily stand next to Jacobs's readings of Cosi fan Tutte and Le nozze di Figaro.  Finally-a recording of Mozart early opera buffa that shines next to the Da Ponte trilogy.  We have here cases of mistaken identity (Roberto/Nardo, Violante/Sandrina), handled with the same sensitivity as in the later operas (Susanna/Rosina, Giovanni/Leporello, Guglielmo/Tizio, Ferrando/Sempronio).  The composer of the Namest edition surely understood how Mozart achieved the emotional sweep in his later years.

Freiburg Barockorchester plays with sparkling vigor under Jacobs as always.  From the opening timpani strikes in the Overture, you find yourself hooked to this early Mozart piece.  In the buffo ""mad scene"" in the Act II Finale, we see our two protagonists lose their minds, assuming the personalities out of a Graeco-Roman pastoral opera, as the orchestra comments; the oboes mimic bagpipes or chaumes, the basses and cellos mimic the drones of a musette, while the strings play pizzicato like Orpheus's lyre.  A signature in Jacobs's recordings is the prevalence of improvisation in the basso continuo.  Especially touching and noteworthy is the fortepiano's quote of Mozart's very late ""Adagio for Glass Harmonica, K617a,"" played as an introduction to the opening secco recitative of Act III.  (Written very close to Mozart' death, Jacobs's employs it here as a beautifully eery, yet subtle nod to the composer in this reading of a posthumous version of what is perhaps his greatest childhood work.  It admittedly has no connection with La finta giardiniera, but it adds a profound touch.)

""Da scirocco a tramontana"" foreshadows the arias of Rossini.  Here Jeremy Ovenden shines as the Count Belfiore.  Here, the Count brags about his Roman ancestry-he purports to be a descendant of the Roman emperors and consuls.  He strikes a perfect balance with the enlarged orchestra which plays with bombast, both to augment and poke fun at the Count's pretentiousness.  It is one of the highlights of the record and easily allows Ovenden to be the record's star.

The baritone Nicolas Rivenq sings yet another one of the record's highlights, ""Dentro il mio petto io sento.""  The orchestra explodes toward the end of the aria to bring it to a bombastic close, an effect one would expect from Cosi fan Tutte.  I have been surprised to see Rivenq, a baritone, beginning to take on roles more commonly taken by tenors (the High Priest in Idomeneo, for example).  The warmer color of his voice is a nice touch to the older Don Anchise here, and his voice does sound completely at home in this upper range.

We also have the delightful soprano spinto, Sunhae Im, and a personal favorite, Alexandrina Pendatchanska who gives us a deep and fiery reading of Arminda along the likes of Elettra or Donna Elvira.

La finta giardiniera is a rather difficult opera to cast.  Called an opera buffa, it is more of an drama giocoso, like Don Giovanni, combining dramatic and comic elements in one.  However, the rest of the cast is comfortable and in-character.  Jacobs has said that he finds it important when in the studio, that his singers be able to act using only the voice.  His present recording is a fine example of this.

The bottom line is this: This is a stellar recording of a skillful posthumous edition (only five years after Mozart's death) by someone who knew Mozart's music so well that the edition sounds authentic.  Together with Jacobs's conducting and his winning cast, this is a highly recommended recording."
Oops <SEP> The wrong vinyl came in this
Five Stars <SEP> Impeccable

Barf. <SEP> Whaaaaat the eff. This is beyond cringy.
"Since it was so good and blessed several friends <SEP> Life changing. I usually do not buy sermons on cd but got this a few years ago during a conference and a friend ""borrowed"" it. Since it was so good and blessed several friends, one day I started thinking about some of the messages and decided to order it again."
Five Stars <SEP> Absolutely awesome!!!
Cellophane is awesome tune <SEP> Its nice to hear from the again. Its been a few years. I heard this song and it was great
"Better than I thought, worse than I'd hoped <SEP> I was expecting the more normal orchestrated version. It was still good, however not exactly what I was looking for."
"Good Effort <SEP> Good effort with this, but honestly, the quality of the synth makes me hate these albums by Monsalve. I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing how anybody who knows this soundtrack (or Majora's) can give this five stars. The quality is worse than the actual game, which was N64 MIDI, already not the greatest, and every single song misses beats, important half-steps, and sometimes entire keys. Listen to the song previews here on Amazon, then go listen to the actual songs on YouTube. No comparison. I do feel really bad leaving a negative review, it's something I never, ever do. But I'm a die-hard fan and these albums sound like poop. Sorry."
"Superb new album <SEP> Chris Brashear is a great singer songwriter who will please your listening ears. This CD is just loaded with original songs that will mesmerize you throughout. He is helped by having many wonderful musicians like Mike Compton, Tim O'Brien, Todd Phillips, and many more. If you aren't too familiar with Chris Brashear, then this would be a great way to get started. First class CD that you will enjoy over and over."
One Star <SEP> Would only play Oop poop ado...not song I purchased it for.
y <SEP> Like it a lot salute
average <SEP> Item was great fast delivery new product..The CD on the other hand average not worth the purchase at all has 2 songs at most save your money
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful rendition of an old hymn - excellent!
Good <SEP> I watched this band for a while before they got signed with a record label. They have some pretty good music. It's always nice to see a talented band bring something new to the table.
One Star <SEP> I bought the wrong song. That's why I gave it a one.
"Love it! <SEP> Biggest Mistake is such a great song!  The Secret State is a fantastic new band hitting popular radio stations nationwide, and I just love their new single!"
"Bad is really good, great for exercising <SEP> Michael's music is always energetic and full of a beautiful beat!  I love this for exercising!  Catchy tune will have you humming all day."
The Secret State Rocks! <SEP> The Secret State  is a new rock group with two GREAT songs! The lead singer has a unique voice. Love the tracks!
"A miss/DOA album, sadly letdown <SEP> This album lacks the power, majesty, and purity of the other TSFH albums and tracks. This is a true miss for the TSFH team and a huge disappointment for me. I do realize that this is more of a in-between album, but I look forwards to the TSFH team returning to more exciting and powerful music. Thanks for all the other great albums and keep pushing the boundaries of what EPIC music should sound like!"
Two Stars <SEP> Cassette version not vinyl
ugly music <SEP> was very dissapointed..thought the music to be much better than it was..i won't buy there music again..thank you anyway good try
"Chills <SEP> I managed to happen across a Typhoon song one day and fell in love. If you like good music (played with real instruments) you'll love Typhoon.

This album, Hunger and Thirst, rose incredibly fast in my iTunes to become one of my most-listened-to albums. Once you start it, it's damn-near impossible to stop."
"rate it <SEP> just wanted to rate it so i could get suggestions for more like it.  But anyways, the album is awesome."
Project: Funk Da New Rap <SEP> Old School underrated Master.  Love the Album
Five Stars <SEP> This was a great value! Like it a lot!
One Star <SEP> BAD
One Star <SEP> did not work with my CD/DVD player!
One Star <SEP> Dumb
I guess for the laughs at how bad it is <SEP> I don't even know why I purchased this song. I guess for the laughs at how bad it is?
Loved this LP because it features my grandfather Pedro J <SEP> Loved this LP because it features my grandfather Pedro J. Gonzalez. He wote and sang the songs in this LP. I now can share this music with family.
"Great Listening! <SEP> Keith Harkin was showed us his stuff and was a crowd pleaser with Celtic Thunder.  As keith moves alone, he doesn't disappoint with this great blend of music that will wake you up, bring romance back to your heart and leave you feeling good."
Five Stars <SEP> Great music to listen to when you are trying to relax after a long day of work.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful Strings--Beautiful music!
Average <SEP> No melodies no rhythm
All Christian couples get this!!! <SEP> This is a very good song and is a powerful song!!
"Thank you, Reika Morishita! <SEP> A great song overall and a fantastic tribute to Mega Man Legends fans!  Give it a listen, you won't be sorry!"
"Great Song <SEP> Jeremy's rendition of O Come, O Come Emmanuel is amazing. It is the perfect addition to any holiday worship set."
Heather is back <SEP> I would like to dedicate this beautiful song to my beautiful niece who was just born.  This fits how i feel about her
Five Stars <SEP> great
"Still playing it after school dropoff!! <SEP> Yup, the tunes are catchy, the melodies beautiful, the message is crystal clear.  We love these songs, we love the exuberance, and we have loved the live performances.  this particular album, especially, has been playing non-stop.  Track #6, Train Dance, is on repeat.  And I enjoy each play through!!"
Great for iPhone ring tone too! <SEP> Excellent song!!!!
American <SEP> Don't get any better than this
"I am a fan but <SEP> I love her music but this different from ,I not a fan of this song I like the original better."
"Superb performance on CD, but terrible MP3 edition <SEP> The CD set is superb (5 stars!) but stay away from the MP3 edition. Whoever made the transfer must have been pressured for time because the final seconds of many tracks are cut off, what's sometimes called ""audio dropout."" Same is true for the newly released COSI FAN TUTTE by the same forces. VERY ANNOYING. I have ALWAYS admired the quality control behind Amazon's products and services, but their Cloud Player service will be in trouble unless they devote more time to recording quality. If you want an MP3 copy of this recording or the new COSI, buy the CD edition and upload it to Cloud Player yourself.

"Poor Quality <SEP> Woody was probably singing his heart out, but we mostly got the screeching.  Some of the songs were merely hearing Woody having fun,with a few buddies and probably a jug or two.
This man was a real genius for his time and should be showcased more fittingly."
"If history ever calls him a one-hit wonder, this will be the hit. <SEP> His best song."
"the best modern player in this genre <SEP> Gonzalo Bergara is, to me, the best modern player in this genre.  There may be players that play a little more outside, but his solos are compositional, like his writing.  Well worth it if you are into jazz manouche and want to get a different spin on the genre."
"The original mix is not that great <SEP> Miami 305 is a much better version, the original is lame and was a waste of time and money. What happened to quality music?."
"A 6 STAR Album <SEP> I'm a Googoosh fan for dacades.  There is no ordinary song between Googoosh works for all of them are EXTRA Ordinary. In this album and in my opinion, ""Nagoo Bedroud"" is the song of ALL times.  To me it is the Best of the best.
You never ever disappointed to buy this album.  Buy it and don't share that."
"Only read the capital letters <SEP> ever SinCe i heaRd this song, my lifE Was irrevoCAbly changed for the Positive. words CannOt truly express My life-changing experience."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great songs on his albums.  Fun,sweet country songs"
Don't give up song <SEP> Not what I expected.
"Really sweet. <SEP> Something something  something the the love of you and me , will always be here essentially. My grandbaby gets this one stuck in her head and it's a really sweet song."
Like it <SEP> But then I'm a PC fan - bought it in show of support of debut of her talent but actually like listening to it.
"Good to listen <SEP> Loved tone of singer Priyanka.

will never disappoint you in any way

I will recommend this to all music lover"
Beautiful song <SEP> It's a very moving beautiful song and I love listening to it. Anyone who loves Jewish people would join this heartbreaking prayer.
One Star <SEP> poor recording fades
Five Stars <SEP> This is the most beautiful song I've ever heard!
"Disappointment <SEP> Love No Doubt, absolutely hate this song.  Soooo annoying. Can't wait to hear what the rest of their album sounds like but I pray it doesn't sound anything like this song."
"no doubt BARELLY recognizable in a bad way <SEP> What is this band trying to do? It is so far away from their signature sound, which doesn't have to be duplicated, but to sound so bizare, horrific and outside any realm of a musical statement other than absurdly weird. I feel like being a human who can hear is an insult to the band."
"I will listen to this all year long <SEP> This song is a different rendition - doesn't replace the older, more recognized versions in my mind, just adds to the list of carols I love.  I don't limit them only to Christmas when songs bring me to wonder and meditation.  This one makes me smile."
i really hate this song <SEP> just another fake ripoff song about nothing. i've only heard this due to thursday night football. and it ruins every thursday night of my life. so whack.
"Awesome <SEP> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this song. I have this song set on replay on my mp3 player. Priyanka is a beautiful lady and her song is the best. Cannot wait for others. I hope she releases others!!!"
Great song & video <SEP> The lady's voice is nice but it has been altered a little (kinda hurts your ears when you blast it) otherwise it's a great song and video with lots of vivid colors and beautiful scenery.
"Love most of Carlos's music! <SEP> Love most of Carlos's music!  We downloaded several of the tunes from this album and have NOT regreted it.  Carlos is also a sincere individual, if you've ever met him personally.  May HaShem continue to bless Carlos as he seeks to walk in Truth."
"as usual, it disappeared from my library <SEP> as usual, it disappeared from my library"
fun <SEP> bought this one for my kids they love WWE and Ryback in particular they have all of the theme entrance songs
Ryback is the worst! <SEP> So is his music. Screw the new Bill Goldberg! No idea why the WWE insists on pushing him. No talent whatsoever.
"Love it! <SEP> This song is just so beautiful, i don't know how i have passed over it for so long, glad i purchased it!"
song is waste of time <SEP> Worst song ever...dont buy it...just a waste.
"30 minutes for $9 ?? <SEP> Tired of artists ripping people off.  this whole CD is the length of one or two ambient songs and this guy chrarges full price... NOT, will not get my money."
"Ultra Lounge begins to beat a dead horse.  4th in the series is mediocre at best! <SEP> <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Liberty-The-Definitive-Julie-London-Handbook/dp/1492914657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook</a>&nbsp;As a jazz, lounge and exotica musicologist and author of Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook.  I have always in the past been so impressed with Ultra Lounge's complete library of recordings from lounge, cool and hot jazz, mambo and mid century music library.

The packaging was always fun, with amazing liner notes on the historical recordings as well as cocktail recipes and most importantly brilliant clear remasters of rare cuts.  However part of the ultra lounge charm that started in the 90s was the CDs, the packaging. With the advent of Mp3 digital, we loose all of the important historical liner notes and information.  Also with the first two volumes of Christmas Cocktails being outstanding...  by this Cocktail 4 we have lost a lot of steam.

This edition has mediocre selections that are not passed properly. It feels like a mix match of oddities instead of a flowing perfect  blend of styles..  In other words this cocktail leaves a nasty after taste.

My belief is they should have stopped after volume 2, and concentrated on expanding on the themes that worked like there first volume 1 Mondo Exotica

Or a better idea would have been to compile all the cool jazz mellow xmas cuts on one cd and all the swingy hot xmas on another and still all the latin cuts on a 3rd.  It would have created better programming and flow. That was my beef with this album, to hear a mellow cut followed by something uptempo blasting in my ears. It is out of sync

Also no Esquivel in the entire collection?"
"Not nearly as good as volumes 1 & 2, mediocre at best <SEP> I couldn't agree more with doggymcnuggets above, except I'd probably reduce it to 2 stars. This set is a pale imitation of Volumes 1 & 2, a lot more MOR than lounge. No physical copy, fewer tracks, no liner notes, no track info, no release dates -- not really much value for money. At a time when the media conglomerates ought to consider a ""value added"" approach to mining their vaults, instead they resort to a bare bones but full price approach. Showing neither respect nor appreciation for their catalog or their customers, they wonder why sales continue to decline when the answer is obvious. This set frankly doesn't deserve the number of words we've spent discussing it."
"Bounceon 10! <SEP> Loved the song originally, but B. Ford improved on the product."
Four Stars <SEP> All time favorite.
"A great album, to put on in the morning before stressful day <SEP> Yeah if your hippie way like to meditate in the morning this is a good product I downloaded on my kindle fire and like to sit in a darkened room and listen to it with a large cup of coffee at five o'clock in the morning and somehow the day just seems to get better the projection is the perception respectfully Johnny Irish"
"Stirring and Romantic <SEP> I remember this song from the first time I heard it in the theater, and it hasn't lost its power to tug at the heartstrings."
"Great, overlooked band. <SEP> This band may have gone further is its name wasn't so awesomely offensive.  Listening to Pandora radio has turned me on to SO many bands I otherwise would never have heard."
"Home by Mirusia <SEP> Mirusia's voice is not suited for contemporary music.  She's at her best singing classics like Ave Maria, Panis Anelicus etc."
I bought this for a certain song. <SEP> I bought this for my wife for a certain song. The rest were only so so.
Great Classic Rock <SEP> This album is a wonderful mixture of classic rock songs. I would recommend it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I am.
"The Best Bond <SEP> Pierce is the best bond. It took a while for him, but this movie made it worth it. Tina Turner does a good job with the song."
"""Lithea"" is loaded with magical beauty and emotional richness!!! <SEP> ""Lithea"", released at March 14th, 2012 in limited edition of 200 copies, is already the third full length album and the closing part of triptych album series together with ""Hypersona"" and ""Hollow"" CDs. 36 is the project of UK based Dennis Huddleston, who releases his music through his own 3six Recordings label. Unfortunately, I didn't know anything about this extremely talented artist until few weeks ago when Kev of Stormloop pointed rM community to this project. Big shame on me for not locating 36 much earlier, however, it's always better later than never!!! Anyway, it's time to unwrap this beauty. Visual part of ""Lithea"" strikes right away, a very nice matte-laminated 4-panel folded cardboard sleeve case with spine. Funny accented navigation communication between pilot and tower control perfectly introduces the name of the project. Warmly inviting drone with beautifully disturbing hiss on ""Cocoon"" is absolutely breathtaking, what a prelude!!! Spiralingly euphoric sonic bliss at its most evocative!!! I should mention the album is comprised of no less than 18 tracks, but some of them are rather shorter, transitional passages connecting longer movements. More minimal, frosty with hints of nostalgia ""Susurrus"" belongs to the longest pieces on this journey. The title track, ""Lithea"" hits with its melodramatic intensity, it's a pity it clocks to 2 and half minutes only. Nostalgic warmness is gracefully floating through rainy ""Deluge"" with heavenly touch of distant choirs, organic and angelic stunner!!! Glitchy, but restful ""Radio"" nicely bridges ""Deluge"" with the next masterpiece, ""Reunion"". Filled with warmhearted feelings and again enriched by ethereal femme choirs. Gorgeously absorbing!!! Shorter, slightly more experimental ""1983"" with children's voices brings back long forgotten memories from a childhood. ""One"" attracts with its deeply imaginative and relaxing dronescape while the following short, ""World After April"" invades with mysterious voice samples. Both, mechanically clocking ""Seance"" and warmly tinkling and drifting ""Dreamscape"" evoke a very intense and intimate moments. ""Dayasan"" keeps its enchanting quality while colored by hissy atmospheres and distant voices. Bridging ""Broken Toy"" is by far the most experimental piece here. Now it's the time to enter the darker terrains with ""Leviathan"" and ""Levitate"". Deeply mysterious femme voices on ""Levitate"" soar over the deep dronescapes and reach the shores of purely visualizing sonic paradise!!! Glitchy drone ambience of ""Saphron"" follows the footsteps of ""Levitate"" with choirs of angelic beauty. Nearly 11 minutes long epilogue ""Another World"" is the next peak of ""Lithea"" with its slowly evolving, intense and evocative euphoria, peppered with factory-like clocking sounds. A truly grandiose finale!!! ""Lithea"" is loaded with magical beauty and emotional richness, and it captures the true essence of nostalgia, intimacy and warmness in each of the 18 tracks!!! An ultimate masterwork deserving my highest recommendation!!! Bravissimo, Dennis!!!

"I'll be teaching the WSC to middle school students <SEP> I'll be teaching the WSC to middle school students.  I enjoy the guitar accompaniment, and Holly has a very pleasant voice.  Memorizing something which was written in the 1600s is a challenge, this will help make that challenge easier.  I can't get the tune for ""What is the chief end of man"" out of my head, so learning by music works!!"
"FWGO - For Weepy Girls Only... <SEP> A Mawkish Celebration of self-pity.  Stupid, insipid lyrics if you stop and really think about the meaning of the words.  Top 40 radio staple due to stupid radio audience.  Awful! Awful! God Awful!"
"Derivative Repetitive Drivel <SEP> Reading the other comments here I've concluded they were PAID to write nice nice about this amplified drivel. This ain't blues and it ain't jazz, might be slightly R&B but mostly it just repeats the corny hooks, blasts the trombone and doesn't deliver. About the cover, what is the foreground person-a man, woman, or what? Story? Where? I doubt that this band would draw enough to fill a garage let alone a club. Everything about the band is derivative and wanna be flashy. I wouldn't give you a dime for any tune on the CD. I returned it. By the way, Rusty sure ain't Elvis either."
"Beautiful Ethiopian jazz album <SEP> An exquistely balanced flow of the style that derives from the modern renaissance of Ethiopian music, abstracted into jazz without losing its distinctive characteristics. Similar to the way that Abdullah Ibrahim' s playing changed the piano into an instrument that expressed an African musical sensibility, Samuel Yirga has made the piano an Ethiopian instrument. There are some lovely melodies, and it is an album the rewards play after play. Masterful, with depth of beauty."
"Beautiful piano music! <SEP> I came across this album while looking for something else on Amazon. After listening to a few samples, I decided to buy the mp3 album.  I am blown away with how beautiful and emotional his playing is. I'm writing the review today while searching for more of his music. Highly recommended!"
Worth the money! <SEP> I listen to this year around! I've had the cd for several years and one of her best of all time!
... prince only preaches in way that makes me feel like its ok to sin <SEP> joseph prince only preaches in way that makes me feel like its ok to sin ...and this book had no profound impact on my spiritual life
"Amazing song! <SEP> I love this song! Melissa Benoist (Marley) has an amazing voice, and I love what Glee did with this song! Although Adele's version is amazing too, I can't help but listen to this version more and more."
Best in business <SEP> Best in business
"Ordered 2 discs, one for myself and one as ... <SEP> Ordered 2 discs, one for myself and one as a gift.  Neither would play anything.  As if they were totally blank"
"AMAZING <SEP> i love this song its amazing and i cant stop listening to it, i LOVE glee its AMAZING. DOWNLOAD this song now"
Patrick.....Patrick.....Patrick.....Patrick..... <SEP> All I hear is vomit. And the name Patrick for some reason.
Great song! <SEP> You will not regret buying this song! Americano/Dance Again is a great mash - up! You may not love glee but there songs are very well done!
"Not To Dance <SEP> When it has came down to the cast of Glee, they haven't really done enough to celebrate music by heart, and instead made music sound more like Musak than really worth its money. That is the case with the mix of Americano and Jennifer Lopez's Dance Again. Honestly, the connection of both songs is absolutely terrible, and worth less than heart. I really didn't like the song. It really was absolutely boring and lacking voice and heart. Jennifer Lopez always struggled with voice and inner soul in her music, and this also shows how poor Glee really has chosen to follow in tone and voice. They did it well when they honored Whitney Houston earlier this year, but not really in the tone of voice.

Song: D-"
"Love the song! <SEP> Have been hunting for this one for way too long to count, now I can listen to it to my heart content."
"DIFFERENT PULSES -THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR <SEP> This is totally new Asaf Avidan than we ,Europeans ( hmm... well, a lucky minority of them) knew from the previous 3 fantastic records with the Mojos. We have a different sounds&rhythms here. No traditional blues, folk or hard rock tunes. What we got is a new music quality, a mix of modern programming percussion&drum rhythms,keyboards and acoustic instruments like bass clarinet,trumpet,trombone and guitar. All this plus incredible, fresh, distinctive, catchy Asaf voice and great, deep lyrics will put you in a hypnotic state of mind.
You won't mistake this guy with anybody else. It's really a fantastic feeling when you are listen to the record where everything is in the right order. The melodies are so soulful and every detail of arrangement meaningful as well. But this is not a collection of songs that are written to make you feel good and relaxed. That's why there are no potential hit songs on this album, with three exceptions - ""Different Pulses"" , ""Love it or leave it"" and ""613"". But all songs will rock something inside of you 'cause they are simply magnificent and timeless.
Asaf Avidan shows with this album that he is not afraid to take a risk and discover a new musical areas. And the result is as we can hear: Different Pulses; a masterpiece,an instant classic and without the shadow of the doubt, the best album of the year 2012."
"delightful mood invoked <SEP> Very nice, not overt or sledge hammery, summons up a sensual frisson of delightful feelings, nice way to prep for an evening of fun. Wish he'd make one specifically for that purpose."
"Love the song <SEP> After listening to the song and then watching the movie, the song made sence and made it all that more romantic and cute to listen to."
fun fun fun <SEP> The only way to play records.
Five Stars <SEP> Great album
"This is a cover. <SEP> This is a cover, and not the original.  The picture is misleading, so I bought this thinking it was from the soundtrack."
One Star <SEP> Very poor cover.
"Best singer in the world! <SEP> Barbara Cook is in a class by herself!  There just is no one like her.  The clarity!  She sings the lyrics!  Her pitch is always perfect.
She just gets better and better."
One Star <SEP> not the version I was expecting
Five Stars <SEP> Good
"HB surround sound rocks!! <SEP> HB SURROUND SOUND, some of the best new music out!! Out of Huntington Beach,CA,they bring a sound that's all their own!! It has a mix of ska,punk and rock, their music is different and fresh!! And if they are ever playing by you ,go see them,you will be hooked they give you a show that will make you dance!!"
One Star <SEP> Not what I expected
Two Stars <SEP> Starts with about a four minute explanation of hypnosis never really gets anywhere
"Happy Resurrection Day everyone <SEP> Miss Edwards sings of experiences with a Savior that she knows intimately. Her song ""The Harlot"" always causes me to tear up. Hey, it's 4 minutes after midnight March 27, 2016. Happy Resurrection Day everyone :)"
Five Stars <SEP> No problems with anything.
"Worth listening tonot a gimmick or fad <SEP> For such a rough voice (and he roughs it up to the max hereto such a degree that some might actually prefer the lo-fi cover of Creep from O&A), he has some really thoughtful things to say, and great melodic hooks, too. Particularly recommend tracks 35."
"one of thd best songs ever written <SEP> I like this cover just because its Daniel Mustard, but I like the cover he did on opie radio show better."
"I get that original masters might not be available or in good condition, but it would have been nice of ... <SEP> Levels are very low and it's a re-record. I get that original masters might not be available or in good condition, but it would have been nice of the fact was specified."
Good easy listening <SEP> Classical music chosen to be non-abrasive -- good accompaniment to a good read. What more can I say? Two words!
Uninspired <SEP> Uninspired.
Same old songs! <SEP> Not a very good album.....Does feel like that band is just going through the motions. This one can be skipped.
Five Stars <SEP> This is a smaller version of the original album......keep that in mind
"Five Stars <SEP> great product, fast delivery"
On three......relax! <SEP> I simply love this person's music. Everything I've gotten from him has been well produced and thoghtfully composed. Very easy to relax while listening to this and other albums by Liquid Mind.
wasted money. <SEP> Did not work on my cd play........wasted money.
Five Stars <SEP> Very good. Selections vary from familiar to more classic. Volume levels are not consistent.
"I only got it for 'Grey Clouds' <SEP> The only reason I got this album is because of 'Grey Clouds', which is a fantastic spoof of 'Little Fluffy Clouds'.  Most of the rest of the album is of a very different style, and, frankly, I hate it."
Those boys can play!!! <SEP> John D Hale band is a great throw back to real country music!!!!! Smooth Roose is one talented musician.  Real farm boys too!!!!
ok <SEP> it could have been longer. also not a live version to much noise to enjoin poop poop poop poop poop
Of course it's awesome <SEP> It's Ari. Of course it's awesome
to much visual comedy for a cd! <SEP> I'm a fan of ari's podcast and he's a great comic but this cd is aweful. Most of the comedy is visual which just dosn't translate to audio. You hear the crowd laughing at his movements during a joke or hand jestures and your left hanging.
Incredible <SEP> This album is amazing. It's heavy but has a really nice groove to it. Just check it out. If you like Ghost you'll like these guys.
"This Album Rocks! <SEP> Bloody Hammers is the best album I've heard in a long time. Each track has its own personality, but they meld so well together. There are some super heavy riffs with lots of fuzz, melodic vocals, and haunting organs. Can't wait to hear more from them, but it's hard to imagine they could pull off something this good again. Highly recommended."
"Waste Of Money And Time !!!! <SEP> I usually like this kind of music, but this record changed my mind. The ""Devil"" images and songs about witches gets old fast. You can tell that the drums were done on a machine(not very well), and the vocals were ran through a harmonizer. This songs start sounding the same a couple tracks in. If you're needing a laugh, or something to play at a kids Halloween party...You've found the right disc."
One Star <SEP> Do not buy this. I did by accident.
"Unable to get list of affirmations with the download version <SEP> I purchased this and 2 other Binaural Beat Mp3 downloads.  After purchase, I was told that there is no way to get the list of affirmations that are contained within this download.  I am not comfortable putting subliminal messages into my mind without knowing that I agree with the messages, so I cannot bring myself to listen to this."
One Star <SEP> Horrible horrible horrible.
don't see any changes <SEP> It didn't worked. I have try it now for over a month a nothing has changed. I don't recommend this product. To me it is a phony.
Purchased by a friend <SEP> I cannot really say.  She listens to them but she still in a bad marriage.  She listens to them but see very little results.
"No Frequency Increased <SEP> As expected, this will not increase my vibration. There are other sources online which will actually do the trick...free, but this track I'm afraid does not work on me in terms of raising my vibration."
"Need more information <SEP> What are the subliminal messages? I can't find them listed anywhere. Once I'm comfortable with what's being played into my subconscious, then I'll adjust my rating."
One Star <SEP> I have several different topics of these and I swear they all sound the exact same.
problems with downloading <SEP> I chose this rating because of problems downloading issues. I have downloaded other and have had a few problems after a while with them.
"Bootleg!!!! <SEP> There is no proof of an actual official CD release of this album, I too got suckered in on buying this CD, it sounds like crap, just a warning."
"meh <SEP> Mediocre lyrics at best. Unimaginative instrumentation. Vocals were a bit grating and could have been mixed a lot better. Sounded like they recorded this in someone's basement using Garage Band and a Radio Shack microphone. Why would anyone pay for a no-name band like this when they could get quality music for Andrew Bird, The Killigans, and The Lumineers for a cheaper price? Let the disappointment commence."
"Just Can't Get Enough <SEP> ""Something About You"" was already an awesome song that is perfect for the club, choreographed dances, or even a small party. Now, with 15 remixes there is even more energy and a song for every moment. You won't be bored because each remix is unique and climatic!"
... an i-movie of our visit to Thomas the Train--grandchildren loved it! <SEP> Very realistic--used in an i-movie of our visit to Thomas the Train--grandchildren loved it!
"Great song...too short <SEP> This is great tune, but it needs to be a little longer to earn our hard-earned money. I hadn't heard of Rodolphe before this, but i'll definitely be looking out for his songs in the future."
"Philp wesley's inspriation is in Christ Jesus. The music ... <SEP> Philp wesley's inspriation is in Christ Jesus. The music is all keyboard , has a bit of a dark side to it at times, but is all thought provoking ."
"Better quality <SEP> Recording quality is much better than his older albums. If you didn't like some his other albums due to quality, this is much better!"
Fine Listening Experience !! <SEP> Phillip Wesley is a fine pianist. I always enjoy listening to his recordings. If you love listening to beautiful relaxing music for the soul check this artist out.
Surfs up <SEP> Nice early recording live.
"Too much Clashing of sounds and hand-clapping for me! <SEP> I thought I was buying the whole album, but when I listened to it, I was glad I did not buy the whole album.  Ma;ybe I should have listened to the other songs before making a decision, but just this one was enough of clashing, discordant sounds and shouting and clapping for me.  Maybe someone else from othie disciplines would find it rewarding.  I do not like to criticize other's point of view, especially relating to religion, but this was not the q;uiet, soothing meditation music I was looking for."
"LOVE! <SEP> I love this song. When I need inspiration for writing or drawing I usually turn to music to wake up my mind, and get the creativity flowing. This one in particular has helped me get out of some serious dead spots!"
I'm pretty sure thats not Carrie Underwood <SEP> This is the second time that I have got a MP3 file and thought it was the original artist and it wasn't.  I'm very disappointed.  Don't get me wrong who ever is singing has a great voice but I wanted the original.  Why are there so many karaoke versions on amazon and not clearly marked.
didnt like this version <SEP> I just didn't like this version. It sounds differant from the one I have been hearing on the radio stations
Five Stars <SEP> great
Great tune. <SEP> Lyrics are so true.  Great tune.
Five Stars <SEP> great instrumental
Four Stars <SEP> Good music!
Five Stars <SEP> Kreay is my girl I can finally support her
Two Stars <SEP> Oh my god - I bought this album!? What was wrong with my head!?
"Sit down, sit down, sit down! <SEP> Please sit down ok! It's noise not music!"
product itself is awesome good quality no problems with the store or retailretail ... <SEP> product itself is awesome good quality no problems with the store or retailretail part of this I just simply do not like this album and I didn't know until I listened to it.
"junk music with vulgar language <SEP> My much younger associate wanted me to download this for her because she had problems downloading to her phone. She (40) likes it. I (70) think it is pathetic as music or lurics. I know my children do not care for it, but they are executives."
Two Stars <SEP> Works Great! but yuck. I'm a tide fan. Gift!
Great Contemporary Black Gospel Choir <SEP> An Excellent Contemporary Balck Gospel Choir.  The choir director (Rodney Friend) was a Grammy Nominated Solo Artist and also responsible for may of the hits on albums by Phil & Brenda Nicholas and Vernessa Mitchell.
"Thunderhead <SEP> The Previous review tells the story better than I ever Could I have seen This Band Live in 1975 opening for The Edgar Winter Group with Rick Derringer and Ruby Starr and the Grey Ghost and became an instant Fan. Mike Dagger is a amazing Vocalist and Man can He play the Flute He has a certain Stage Presence that really makes this Group Stand Out. The Twin Guitar attack is amazing and The Ryhthmn Secion will Blow You away. Bobby T where does one Begin He has played with Black Oak Arkansas,Michael Bolton, Johhny Winter this Guy can Rock Your Tail off He plays like a Wild Man Reminds Me of Tommy Aldridge only better. Buy The CD see the Band if You get the Chance You will not be Disappointed."
Addictive song... <SEP> Still listening to it long after Christmas! It is not only catchy but has great lyrics my kids and I love to sing.
One Star <SEP> Some tracks way too short and sound very poor.
"Play It Over Again and Again <SEP> Recorded back in 1983, still sounds so contemporary. Lament and Leaving - truly beautiful, taking enjoying Jazz to another level, also drum less is quite enjoyable with Philip's captivating style and bassist really set the pace. Chet played really sensitive and purposeful.

An album you can listen again and again."
"I GOTTA GIVE THIS 5 STARS <SEP> FIRST OF ALL, I WRITE IN CAPS FOR EVERYONE TO SEE EASIER.  THAT SAID, WOW, WHAT A GREAT ALBUM AND WHAT A SURPRISE THIS ALBUM WAS. CHAMBER JAZZ OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.  THE THING ABOUT PHILIP CATHERINE, HIS TONE IS ABSOLUTELY UNMISTAKABLE.  IN BLUEGRASS, THEY SAY BILL MONROE HAD THAT HIGH LONESOME SOUND.  WELL, I AM GOING TO BORROW A BIT FROM THAT.  PHILIP CATHERINE HAS THAT LONESOME, LATE-AT-NIGHT SOUND.  REALLY WONDERFUL!  I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS ALBUM AND BTW, CHET IS IN TOP FORM.  A PERFECT COMPLIMENT TO PHILIP AND NO SINGING...JUST PLAYING.  BUY IT AND ENJOY...YOU WILL DEFINITELY DIG THIS."
Five Stars <SEP> Have listened to this for 50 years great music.
Two Stars <SEP> Not what I expected.
I have not listened to this. But I can ... <SEP> I have not listened to this. But I can tell you that is a picture of Jimmy Smith on the cover. Not Thelonious Monk. Ugh.
"WTF? Ridiculous mashed together rythyms! <SEP> I bought this after listening to a bunch of samples, and thought it was worth the money. NOT!

As a belly dancer most these tracks are too short for anything (most around 2 minutes) show-like. First negative.

Second negative, and the thing that makes this a HUGE mistake to buy, is the fact that ALL the songs are melodies thrown together with random drum beats AND random background rhythms! The songs are not danceable to period! I don't know if they recorded all the instruments separately in a studio and got the order mixed up or WHAT, but the songs just become ridiculous!!

Stay away!"
"No Stars - if I could <SEP> Are you kidding me?! I love this song and Florence all around, period. They (whoever) took a full bodied, full blooded, full out great  song and turned it into muzac! This is just wrong. And it's in a party mix? I seriously think not."
"I would love him even if he was singing the dinner menu! <SEP> He is quirky, moving and rhythmically unique. He is a true artist in a world where there are very few left."
Sean Outdid Himself <SEP> I love this album. Very much his sound still; but lyrically you can tell priorities have shifted in his life and it is very much reflected in the music.
"Disappointed on both content and quality <SEP> I heard a podcast with this reviewed and interview with the recordist - sounded great - however, either I did not understand that this was more anthropology than nature or it was not said, but this recording is of ALL sounds of the areas recorded - including human activities (cities, sports events, parties, bands, etc.) So instead of getting my own slice of nature in my noise canceling Bose headset, I got everything I could get without a headset in my own city with a little nature mixed in.

Sadly, I also question the recording quality - while I am not a professional - I do consider myself qualified to judge sound and sound recording technology ...  listening to the some of the sequences of nature, there would be some great forrest sounds and then when a nearby bird called, the audio of the background would drop out.

I have to say I was more than a bit surprised since, in the interview on the podcast, the recordist seemed committed to preserving the sounds of the last quiet places in the world. It's almost as if the wrong microphone equipment was selected or the post-production was not handled properly."
Crashed movie maker <SEP> Could not be used in my Movie maker project. It crashed the program. Did this with 2 out of the 3 songs I downloaded.
Great CD <SEP> I love music in general. This is no exception. It's a really good CD to chill or do math homework to.
Best acoustic duo in years! <SEP> Ty and Trey are good friends of mine. They create some of the best felt acoustic rock in the many years I have been listening to music. Check them out at [...]
Five Stars <SEP> excellence song I love this song
"Stone-Cold, Funky Angie! <SEP> Never saw this one coming!

Aside from it being a bit of a chick anthem, Angie shines with this irresistible dance floor gem! Quite a change-up from the neo-soul stylings she's usually known for!

Then again, this is no surprise coming a funkster from rap music's first all female trio Sequence!"
"Stone solid song <SEP> Angie is one of my favorite r&b vocalists, and this sing doesn't disappoint. Has a sound reminiscent of the 1970s or 80s.  Great song!"
OK <SEP> I like her stlye but I expected more from this song. It's missing some flavor. The hook is nice but I'm not feeling the rest of the song.
"blues mix 8 <SEP> outstanding blues music, with mixes and remixeds all songs are good listens"
"Jammin' Southern Soul <SEP> I bought this CD after hearing ""It's A Reunion"" by Ms. Jody on WPFW radio in DC.  When hearing this song I jumped to my feet and started dancing...which happens everytime I play it.  The entire CD is all Southern Juke Joint Soul.  If you enjoy that genre of music I know you will be happy to have this one.  O.B.Buchanan, Donny Ray, Sheba Potts-Wright are just a few of the jammin' artists on this album.  I recommend it."
Five Stars <SEP> ok
"Too short! <SEP> While the nice soothing sound of the rainstorm was of good quality, the recording is only 4 minutes long, for a guy like me that loves listening to these types of recording at night while sleeping this one won't cut it.

I wish the recording would've been at least 1hr+ long (like Sounds of Nature by Joe Baker), that would have made it much better. Also the recording at the end fades to low volume which does not help if you want to loop the recording, you'll definitely notice the ending part which breaks the feeling of listening to a real tropical storm."
Let's Dance ! <SEP> A really nice song ! Great massage also.
"Not the version I wanted <SEP> I didn't know there were 2 versions of this song ...I don't like this one, it is slow and boring, I love the other one."
"The songs you download are NOT the Gabriel songs here <SEP> I agree with the previous reviewer.  I grew up in Texas listening to Gabriel.  I owned their album ""Out of The East.""  The title track has a chorus that says, ""Out of the East, the heavens will sound, every tongue will confess, every knee will bow down.""  If you listen to the sample you can tell it's a different song.  The chorus says something about ""You're the mirror of my heart, the mirror of my soul.""  I don't know who is singing, what song this actually is, or how it got confused with Gabriel but the download is definitely not the music you'll be expecting.

I believe this album is wrong across the internet because I purchased it from iTunes and had the exact same problems as the above reviewer.  I hope someone fixes this because I loved the music growing up and would really like to hear it again.  Big Disappointment."
"Not the Gabriel I remember <SEP> I grew up listening to Gabriel, especially their Out of the East album.  I was so very excited when I saw this and remember all the good songs I knew.  However, when I clicked on many of the links, it is not the Gabriel album I remember.  The first one that I knew it wasn't was You Can't Fool God.  I was ready for the fast, ""You Can't Fool God, you try but you fail.  You can't fool God....""  Nothing at all like it.  I am not sure what that was.  Then I went to song after song that I knew, only to be disappointed.  I hope someone at Amazon reads this because there must be a mistake.  Something is not right on this because it is not the right songs.  :-("
Five Stars <SEP> Item was on time. I can listen to Vanessa Williams all day and of course at Christmas time.
"Vannessa the Nightingale! <SEP> She has the voice of a nightingale! This cd is amazing. Every song,every note she sings lights your heart. This cd is the soundtrack for the holidays. Vannessa the nightingale has created a christmas classic with this cd."
Beauty on record <SEP> Beauty on record.. beuatiful Vanessa singing seasonal songs with variety of choices delivered beautifully by her and the accompanists quite enjoyable.
Great worship music <SEP> Luke was one of the greatest Christian singers ever.
Song is only 1 minute long <SEP> I give it one star because the song is only one minute long. What a rip off.  I should get a refund since Amazon did not list correct sonf length
"Best New Worship Album <SEP> This new cd is amazing! The Universe EP has great songs, but was only four songs. Now they release a full-length with 12 songs, and after hearing it I am blown away. Everyone needs to hear this, it's a superb sound of new Christian contempory worship. From a church (Kinetic Church) that's in Charlotte, the worship matches the quality and originality of Passion and Hillsong United! I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. Pick this up!"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great, dynamic group.  Inspiring music...very melodic.."
"Wonderful <SEP> Interesting mix of songs.  I love the chanting, the water and wind sounds, the birds, the melodies.  Actually pretty fond of the whole album. I play it in my Yoga class and the students expressed their enjoyment as well.  Highly recommended."
One Star <SEP> Not relaxing

"Greatest live band, poor live recording <SEP> We obviously know of the almighty power of a live rammsein show...but that being said, this cd is terrible. The setlist is incredible, but who ever recorded it did a terrible job. Till often goes in and out during the whole recording. Guitars are quiet, and then get extremely loud. just the whole mix is bad and was not well put together. A shame really. Theres probably a reason this is not an official realease by rammstein. Stick with volkerball or live aus berlin"
One Star <SEP> You call this Disco? Really?
One Star <SEP> Impossible to download into iTunes!
Interesting !!! <SEP> I love this album !
This version is not as good as the version Kurt does with the Metropole Orchestra <SEP> This version is not as good as the version Kurt does with the Metropole Orchestra. Too bad Amazon does not carry that version. Bummer.
"Great chorus <SEP> Always liked Grizzly Bear, but never got around to buying any of their songs. But this chorus really nails it for me."
"Great Eastwood flic <SEP> It's Clint at his finest, grittiest best. Westerns were defined by Clint, Wayne, and others. This is a must-have for any western collector."
I just love this song. <SEP> I just love this song. Worth each penny I spend for this song. Unique and different than the other songs now a days.
Love this cd <SEP> Love this cd. His vocals are interesting and wonderful to listen to over and over and over.....
"Doesn't send me <SEP> I adore Elling but this album just doesn't make it for me.  He tortures the melodies to try and give them an original twist.  On Broadway will always belong to George Benson.  Come Fly with Me: well as Dylan says, Sinatra is the mountain all singers must climb.  You Send Me:  Nobody can touch Sam Cooke.  Art Garfunkel's I Only Have Eyes for You was perfection, can't be improved or even matched.  Etc Etc.  The only song I like is I'm Satisfied."
Five Stars <SEP> great song
Five Stars <SEP> Exactly ad described. Well packaged for safe delivery.  Thanks!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love Rachael McFarlane voice found out about her on American Dad hope she makes more albums in the future
"Some songs are amazing, some are misses <SEP> Hot and cold.  Some songs are amazing, some are misses.  Lovely voice."
"Returned...dissapointed <SEP> Only one song I truly enjoyed, and it sounded better on the show...I was actually dissapointed by this album. I returned it one I was able to listen to someone else's copy."
"If it wasn't for a guy named Seth... <SEP> I really tried to give this a chance but I cannot stand Rachael's voice. It's shrill, it's whiny and it's pretty much expressionless. I really had to skip most of them after the first because I could not stand her cloying-ness. I could have respect for her if she had really tried with this album, but it's obvious she's just riding her brother's coattails. Why a picture of Hayley? Why even call it after Hayley? She's a little known cartoon character. Plus it doesn't seem (big fan of American Dad here, so I know) that Hayley would like these songs. Isn't her favorite song supposed to be Gangster's Paradise on the show? If MacFarlane could do at least one thing better, it's make a name for herself. If she put her vocal talent to more (and less shrill) use, she might have something. But she's not even coloring within the lines, she's left the canvas blank."
"Classical or Jazz? Just GREAT MUSIC. <SEP> Explore the group Balmorhea.

Each of the albums has wonderful compositions, melodies, music-scapes. The songs are always moving, changing, with unique combinations of instruments (xylophones, violins, drum set, banjoe, cello, and more...) playing tunes that will catch in your head.

Their live albums are really well recorded, and the others are wonderfully produced.

Highly recommended."
One Star <SEP> Just didn't seem to do ANYTHING for me. The sounds were more bothersome than calming.
Five Stars <SEP> Wish she would do a full CD.
"Amazing sounds: funky, upbeat, and thoughtful indie rock <SEP> I saw these guys in LA when they opened for Papa. I had never heard of them before, but was immediately captivated by their sound. Soft, melodic, thoughtful music. Their third album, Mind Out Wandering, has elements of funk, 70s soft / yacht rock, etc. I love it. Check out ""See You"" and ""Eye to Eye."" Artistic guitar throughout.

I bought their first two EPs after listening to the LP over and over. I needed more. Then I saw them again in LA (I love LA!). The experimented with their sound. It was great. Can't wait for them to return.

I listen to it on the way to work, walking in the sunshine of LA, or just to ease the family into our weekend.

Its exceptionally good with herb."
"If you like Epic Rap Battles of History... <SEP> You will probably like this too. Very humorous lyrics, as is usual for any ERB or Rhett and Link song."
"good beat to blast in your car. <SEP> Look, kanye west is a terrible rapper and this song doesn't make him any better. But the beat to this is good enough to warrant a purchase."
Movie Intro with extraneous noises and long silences <SEP> I was disappointed.  This is the intro to the movie so there are many seconds of nothing at the beginning.  This is my fault.  I should have selected the orchestral version.
Two Stars <SEP> Blah mashups of already written Christmas songs.  Disappointing.
"Bland, unoriginal and lacking passion <SEP> Being a big Failure Club fan, I was excited to see what all of the members of the club would accomplish at the end of their journeys. I was impressed with several of their achievements and I especially wanted to know the outcome of Elizabeth Chan's Christmas song dream. I was gravely disappointed.
Elizabeth has a very average sounding voice. At first it's sweet and pleasant but it quickly becomes boring and repetitive as the album plays out.
A lot of the songs sound the same because Elizabeth sings the same kind of notes in each one.
However, my major problem with the EP is the lyrics. The song used for her music video (which, by the way, is very tacky and ""fake happy"")repeatedly uses verses and lines from other famous Christmas songs. Chan claims to have penned this song, but she obviously borrowed lyrics from other songs which makes this song very unoriginal. The other tracks are original, but they are very dull and kind of hollow. Great music artists have a way of putting intense emotion and passion into their songs. It's as if you can feel the feelings they felt as they sang the song. You can feel the passion they have for their art in their music. With Chan I feel none of this. The songs feel empty and rushed. I don't feel the emotion in any of the songs.
This is probably because Chan has admitted to writing over 200 Christmas songs. There is no way an someone can put their complete effort and passion into so many songs. It should take years to write so many songs, and yet Chan keeps cranking them out.
Overall, I think Chan needs to focus on the quality of her music over the quantity of songs and the fame. She has the potential to be great, but she has a lot of work to do. Her lyric content needs serious work, and her voice just doesn't stand out as it is.
This EP isn't worth $5. I'd say each song is worth one listen to. It might work as filler music for your Christmas playlist if you need a couple more songs."
"j'etaime! <SEP> This innovative, punchy, and most importantly well-executed music is just what I would have asked for, had I ever thought,""I'd like to hear some urban world music with a fresh,tight mix and brothers who rap in French..."" Thanks, freres, and kudos to the producer!"
"There is better Latino jazz out there. <SEP> There is good jazz and there's bad jazz.  This is bad jazz.  Even though Escovedo employs some great musicians, this is undisiplined bad jazz.  I made music with small groups through my high school and college years (and occasionally after).  Good music is melodic and structured.  Each musician has a role and must support the lead rather than contrast with the lead.  Otherwise it is all just noise.  There is a lot of just noise on this album."
Wonderful song <SEP> Quite possibly my favorite song of all time. Beautiful.
One Star <SEP> ok
Doesn't <SEP> Small Talk is just that small talk with a program that just does not work well at all. So many better programs out there I wouuld advise that you try another
?? <SEP> I have no clue what this is I can't say anything more than that? I never listened to this and accidentally downloaded it with a bunch of other songs.
"Nope <SEP> You can add this track to the list of songs that sits around on my harddrive and never gets listened to. Wait, maybe I actually deleted it..."
"Great recording <SEP> Great recording from one of my favorite bands.  Beautiful compositions, David, Stefon and Christian excel  and the Cuban rhythm section are right on target."
Five Stars <SEP> Great album by a great band
No where near as good as Veckatimest. <SEP> The vocals sound pretentious when the melodies go nowhere. Best thing about album is the artwork on the cover and the inside booklet.
Five Stars <SEP> Wise beyond his years.
This is a ripoff. Stay away. <SEP> Don't buy this. It is not a song. It is just sounds. This is just an audio file from a section in the movie. This is not the actual melody or theme from which the movie was made. Snake oil.
It take a Village <SEP> Lee is by far one of the greatest pickers of all time. I heard this cut on XM radio and immediately downloaded it. It;s a hip and haunting cut that you can listen to over and over.
Five Stars <SEP> crazy beat and nice singing on the hook
Substandard music <SEP> This bootleg is not very good.  The sound quality is terrible and there is a conversation happening in the background that is very distracting.  Not worthwhile.
"This is a bootleg <SEP> The first reviewer called it, I ended up re sequencing the first disc, as all of the titles were wrong, and it is missing four songs from the gig.  The second disc is demos that Gene made with CRY, is partially from the 'Silvery Moon sessions.  They are rough demos."
"Bootleg album with hideous sound quality...DO NOT BUY <SEP> This album is atrocious:

1) It's a bootleg. The material covered by this album is owned by the Gene Clark estate and this is an unauthorized release.
2) The sound quality on the first disc, which is copy of the legitimate/licensed Gene Clark Live&nbsp;&nbsp;is unbelievably bad. Sound is ridiculously bad. Song order is wrong. They even speeded up the recordings when mastering. This is a grand master class in the creation of bootleg rubbish.
3) The sound quality on the second disc is mediocre at best, and this material has NOTHING to do with the material on the first disc. It wasn't recorded at the same time (it was recorded years later). It sounds like an average bootleg, and really brings little to the table that isn't already available on legitimate issues.

Stay as far away from this piece of junk as you can."
"Awesome! <SEP> This an awesome song that truly is sung from the heart, if you don't have it, get it!! I listen to it every day and it puts me in the right frame of mind. It's a must have!!!"
Awesome <SEP> This is a great song and the words are so uplifting and meaningful.  The group is very anointed and I hope to hear more from them.
"A song that I hear over and over in my mind <SEP> This song plays over and over in my mind as I a riding down the street or sitting around.  Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
One Star <SEP> To much Lange
"good music motivated by genuine faith <SEP> Listened to this man's testimony and learned he stopped making music for a while to pursue discipleship more seriously. He definitely loves the Lord more than the music which is why I believe he is so passionate in his music. It encourages me and pumps me up. Its a short EP but packed with heart, talent, and good music. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves rap- Christian or not."
Love it! <SEP> I am a new fan of LIsa Page Brooks and I was introduced to her from her song I Want To Say Thank You and to my surprise I didn't know how much of a legend in Gospel music she was.  When I tell you her tone is amazing and the way she phrases her words are unmatched and to see her live is nothing short than amazing!  I love this new single and can't wait to the new album drops!  I am a fan for life!!! God Bless the ministry of Lisa Page Brooks
Love it! <SEP> Excellent song and great download from Amazon. Highly recommended. Canon stands out as one of the prime rappers on the scene.
Two Stars <SEP> Sound doesn't even sound right
"Great french songs <SEP> using it for background music for home movie of cruise, Celine is great in any language. It adds a ambience to the movie"
"Great Ska/Punk Album! <SEP> I first heard this band on the Viernes 13 Pandora station and got hooked on their Hard Rock/Punk twist on Ska. Their is many great tracks but my favorite were ""Ninos"" and ""Dime"". All 15 tracks are really good to listen to, didn't reality feel the need to skip any tracks. Also a heads up, most songs are in Spanish. I would like to see this band live soon, planning on going to one of their shows soon with my friends. I can't imagine what it's like to be in the pit skanking to this band,  it must get crazy in the pit! Much love from a fan in San Diego, CA!"
Four Stars <SEP> very nice CD
"Rogert G Lee <SEP> This is a must for all comedy collections. This Cd is very very funny and has alot of laughs in it with clean langauge, let my teens listen to this one"
Growing up to this song.... <SEP> I grew up with this song my dear friends...A friend of mine recorded it for me randomly...and it stucked to my brain ever since....
Still working on it! <SEP> I like it. It seems to make me relaxed and open to suggestion. I don't want to become a medium as I don't really want to start seeing spirits but I want to improve my intuition. I think it works as I am sensing people's thoughts and feelings. Only been using it a week. The cover is a bit scary though. Whoooah!
One Star <SEP> Poor sound quality. Avoid!
Not for me <SEP> Tried to use it at bed time. Had a horrible headache. This just irritated me. Notes changed too quickly and went back to the same screeching chord again and again.
"It's the first song I've bought, EVER! <SEP> This song wasn't available else and I wanted to listen to it (after hearing it on Sirius XM).

So I bought it in the end!"
"Wonderful song! <SEP> I bought this song because I LOVE ""Tangaroa Whakamautai"". It's very haunting, and very meaningful.

All basics aside, as a Pacific Islander, who TOTALLY agrees with the message of caring for our Earth, this song, which she sings in the Maori language, is a wonderful buy! Amazing!"
This works! <SEP> This works!  Rough day with headache.  Due to surgery next week I have even taken off and Advil and no essential oils like Past Tense which helps a lot of my headaches.  No T#3 until I'm home this evening.  I put this on my iPhone Amazon Music app. and my headache diminished to a dull pressure so I was able to finish my errands and go home and take T#3.
love it <SEP> i have all of his songs and i like them all i really have noting else to say thank you
Excellent traditional Persian music <SEP> I have listened to this CD at least a hundrend times. It is excellent instrumentation and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for that one CD to buy with Persian vocals to listen to in your car or on leisure. One of the best works I have seen in recent years.
"Jesus and Me...BFE (Best Friend for Eternity) <SEP> Just listen to the words.  Whether we are millionaires or paupers, we all go through similar life experiences that hopefully lead to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Love it!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great spa music
"I'M Glad To Know You, My Friends! <SEP> The Los Amigos Invisibles (The Invisible Friends), are the very best dance/soul/disco/funk/trance band in today's music. I've got all of their CD's, and everyone is better than the previous one. The cooperation with Dimitri From Paris is bringing some of the best music to be danced, listened, or simply enjoyed in everyday life. I highly recommend this one as with the rest of LAI CD's released so far. Congratulations, my friends!!"
I have enjoyed the group Fourplay for several years <SEP> I have enjoyed the group Fourplay for several years. This album did not disappoint me. A fresh take on the classic Christmas music.
"I was more than pleased with the compositions and performances of them on this ... <SEP> Though this CD was not what I expected from ""romantic"" classics, I was more than pleased with the compositions and performances of them on this CD. These songs are a fantastic modern take on classical music. Each piece demonstrated a pure genius style and inventive ideas that are little seen in any other compositions."
"A better non-deceptive title would have been ""romantic-era classics""... <SEP> I am a beginner listener to classical music, and I obtained this CD at a bargain store.  My thinking at the time (based on its title and the inclusion of red roses and a statue of a cherub on its cover) was that it might contain pleasant-sounding background music to write my programming source code to.  Only one of the tracks on this CD allows for that (track 4), the rest the tracks are very attention-grabbing and verge on the bombastic, and not in a pleasant manner.  A better title would have been ""romantic-era classics"" instead of just ""romantic classics"".  I feel that both the title of this CD, in conjunction with the photo on the cover, borders on being deceptive to the buyer and also any future listener, especially for someone who is a casual buyer of classical music.  This forces me to subtract two stars to begin with, regardless of the quality of the music.  Add to this the fact that there is a complete lack of any information in the liner notes (the backside of the one-page cover photo is blank) and this begs me to dock it another star.  Made in Canada by Madacy Entertainment Group in 1997, add they could have done much better."
On repeat!! <SEP> Love what James Fortune and Todd Galbreth are doing for the Lord!! Always a true inspiration. A great song to start your day.
JUST MY LUCK <SEP> This is a DOUBLE Abum. I returned it because there was only one record in it.
One Star <SEP> terrible !!!
Timeless! <SEP> Loved it when I was a kid and love it now!
Four Stars <SEP> She will take you to church.
"Old School! <SEP> I love those old school praise songs which bring back memories of my early days of being saved,
when I was so hungry for God!  Those old anointed songs still have that same effect on me today!
Le'Andria is truly a gifted & anointed psalmist."
Four Stars <SEP> OMG I play this song almost every morning before I go out the door
"A little Much! <SEP> Really do love this psalmist, but I think this song was oversung a little. When I viewed it on dvd,
I thought there was too much focus on 1 person in the congregation, rather than focusing on the
whole congregation. When I listen to the cd, I purposely bypass this song because of that."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful music.
Four Stars <SEP> I like it
"No Comment <SEP> Sorry, no comment. I heard the song, but the only thing I remember about it is that I didn't like it."
THIS SONG HERE !!! <SEP> THIS SONG HERE IS POWERFUL AND IT IS PLAYED ALL DAY EVERYDAY! IF YOU DONT HAVE IT GET IT TODAY!
Beautiful <SEP> It's a lovely song. I bought it for my hubby. It's one of his favorite.
One Star <SEP> I could barely understand a word.
I love this song <SEP> I love this song! No one can sing it like her! She sings with so much feeling. I recommend this album to all of my friends
Good Stuff <SEP> My son is a lover of all things weird.  So this was right up his alley.  Thanks for the music.
Defective CD <SEP> The cd arrived defective and has been exchanged. Marlon helped walk us through the exchange process.  Returning the defective cd by 29th. Thanks.
"The beat that punch demons <SEP> Excellent song, it help lifting your spirit up. when you feel down or just tier of worldly people, so have a ear 2 listen"
Best tunage! <SEP> Love Poolside!
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful colored records and quality is fantastic.
"Bought with my stolen phone <SEP> I recently dropped my phone in the Atlanta airport and did not realize it until the next morning. Unfortunately, some thugs found my phone and rather than contact me, which would have been easy to do, decided to purchase some of this vile nonsense with the Amazon app that I had on my phone. It was obviously done before I realized the phone was not in my computer bag.

Be very careful of the Amazon app on your phone!

They also took pictures of each other performing obscene hand gestures with the camera on the phone and the pictures were automatically uploaded to my DropBox. So I have a picture of the little punks. The sad part is that I am sure their parent is the person who found the phone and then gave it their rotten thug child. I believe by purchasing this they committed theft, larceny and wire fraud.

This song should also be zero stars, it is absolutely worthless and stupid."
"Aready reviewed this item. <SEP> I've already commented in your review section.  I don't think his handling of internal and supporting voices in, especially, the fugues is clear."
"just doesn't need what is in it. <SEP> The music is enjoyable, the words are not. That is a deal breaker for me personally. I will delete the song."
Good Summer Country <SEP> I love summer Country music. Hang out by the lake or bonfire with a beer and some good friends. This is good music to do it too.
One Star <SEP> Was given only the preview 0.5 seconds on purchase I assumed would be the complete song.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it.
Great <SEP> Love this sound track.  It's my music when the kids aren't in the car with me. (I have to watch my speed limit LOL)
Steve Vai <SEP> Cool download and I was so happy it was available on Amazon Mp3 Downloads. It only took a few seconds to download and I have spent hours listening to this.
i want my money back <SEP> Not a full song...don't purchase it...i want my money back...if someone knows how to get my money back let me know please
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"One Star <SEP> Disc would not play, ever, in any player."
Cd was scratchy <SEP> I'm disappointed. I love this cd but when I played it was super scratchy and I couldn't enjoy the songs.
"Disc Pirated (Badly) From Vinyl, No Returns! <SEP> It is clear that this disc was (badly) pirated off a record, which is theft, a federal crime, and basically just a jackass move. Now Im being told I cannot even return it. Surprise."
Adorable! <SEP> I used to watch it when it showed on channel 4 and 6 around Christmas time.  I think it's really cool to buy it in my adulthood.
Five Stars <SEP> This is beautiful music..great for a rainy day..the arrangements and musicianship are noteable..
awesome <SEP> This song is incredible. Alejandro never fails to amaze me with his wonderful voice. I walk around singing all day long!
a must in a mobile DJs arsenal <SEP> great song
Great <SEP> Another great summer song to get you in the mood. An under played song. Way to go Jake. Keep up the hits.
Since U Been Gone - Pitch Perfect <SEP> Nice rendition - Pitch perfect was right on tune.... Go Girls Go Girls Go Girls Go Girls Go Girls Go Girls!!!!!
The Best of Bach <SEP> The most lyrical and lovely interpretation of this well-loved work. Not a note is un-thought-out. I wore out an entire set of these CDs in less than a year.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"HR has completely lost his marbles! <SEP> I am as big a HR and Bad Brains fan as any, but I gotta tell it straight here. HR has bumped his head somewhere along the way. Well I am surprised at how good the Build A Nation album was! HR did ruin a few songs (every reggae song). He seems to like to ramble on about nothing at times in Build A Nation, and does the exact same on Hey Wella. In older albums there were messages and thoughtful song writing. None here, just grunting and rambling on about nonsense! Hey Wella in my opinion is COMPLETE GARBAGE."
Four Stars <SEP> Made me laugh repeatedly!  It's so true!
"For fans of smooth and relaxing beats. <SEP> If you like Freddie Joachim or jazzy beats in general, this album doesn't disappoint. It has really fantastic music to let the day just melt away. ""The album is dedicated to love and the great parts of falling in love and the not so pleasant parts."" As mentioned by Freddie Joachim here: [...]
Enjoy!"
"Jazz Hip Hip and Soul mixed into one, support real music!!!!!!!!!!! <SEP> I've been a fan of Freddie for a couple years now and he never disappoints. If you see this Freddie THANKS for the good music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 619 love"
good stuff <SEP> This cd took me back to 1996.  Love it!!! has an electro or acid house sound
just perfect <SEP> Love this mans voice. He sings beyond perfect. You should see him in concert if given the ipportunity. Well pleased
Four Stars <SEP> Really good cover of the Bowie classic.
"Heavily over-modulated <SEP> Heavily over-modulated recording, to the point where I couldn't hear it clearly at any volume level."
Awesome Band <SEP> Just heard this band's CD Saturday night at a party and fell in love.  Plan on seeing them perform live in Houston at the end of the month.
One Star <SEP> This item had some bad pauses in it. Really was not worth the price.
"Half Piano! <SEP> Guess I should have guessed by looking at the title, but half of this album is solo piano. Strange pairing with a brass band, but at least the piano was played well. And that is why the album gets 2 stars from me, because the brass band performance is really poor. Missed notes all over the place, poor intonation and not much musicality demonstrated in the performances. If it was a live performance of a local group, I could understand all the 'clams' but this is supposed to be from America's top brass band. Look at the Black Dyke Band or River City Brass Band or try to hunt for a Buizengen Bras Band recording for some excellent performances."
"Terrible Sound Quality <SEP> Because the instrumental intro is so long, there is no way to know from the preview that the vocal quality is so bad.  The words are distinguishable. A real disappointment."
"Pretty Good! <SEP> Nice performance by a band that understands how to make their instruments sound good, and how to play Prokofiev. Great sounds plus aggressive playing from this Norwegian group. Top notch!"
"intimate, like you are with him hearing him practice at home <SEP> Larry overdubs with himself, playing his old classics, along to programmed digital percussion loops. Doesnt seem like a very promising idea. Well actually it's quite enjoyable. If you like larry you probably play guitar. Well this is like getting a rare chance to hear him practice in his home studio, along with a computer click track or percussion program like you probably do too while practicing.  The percussion sounds just become a time keeping drone, which actually allows you to focus more on his guitar playing. If he had hired a real percussionist like Paulinho DaCosta on his old albums, it would compete more with the guitar, not to mention be far more costly in this day and age of do it yourself music with no label support. So taken for what this is, it's nice if you just want an inimate listen and hear new takes on his old tunes. Good both as background music, and to focus more deeply on his jazz chord changes and solos. The only flaw I hear is actual overload clipping distortion on transient peaks when he picks hard on some songs. Seems he set the recording preamp input gain level too high, or some other level in the recording software, as there is clipping thru out many of the songs on hard picking. Back to the music: He also reharmonizes a few of the tunes chords, which bring new life and extra flavors to these familiar classics, which makes them more interesting in this sparse setting. Doesnt sound too smooth jazzy either, which is nice. So again taken for what it is, it's a pleasant listen, and a rare chance to hear another side of him, in an extra intimate way. Kind of an odd concept, but with the state of music these days what can you expect from a studio type player in the days of few real studios and labels left that would pay a studio guitarist to come in. Gotta do things yourself these days."
"I LOVE THIS SONG!!! <SEP> ITS A VERY BEAUTIFUL SONG, ORIGINALLY RECORDED BY CHAVELA Y SU GRUPO EXPRESS BUT LOS TINOS HAVE MADE A MASTERPIECE OF IT, I REALLY LOE THIS VERSION!!, IT SOUNDS GREAT!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
Five Stars <SEP> Very Good
One Star <SEP> Garbage. An 8 year old could produce this on a cheap electronic piano
"On est au Petit Trianon... <SEP> Mayuko Karasawa has not only resurrected songs either composed or sung by Queen Marie-Antoinette, she has somehow also managed - and this is so much more difficult! - to transport us to the delicate world of the Petit Trianon.  As a French correspondant has so admirably put it, ""...en coutant ces diffrentes chansons, on se trouve d'emble dans l'ambiance lgre et feutre du Trianon...""
Mayuko has created a 'concert' of historical importance but also of great charm.  I just wish that the CDs were available on Amazon."
"One Star <SEP> Either it didn't download correctly, or just wouldn't play! I will not order again!"
Great for high energy Zumba! <SEP> So glad my instructor used this song! Can't help but get a good sweat on while I Make It Shake!
"Splendid work <SEP> This impressive album contains everything I would have loved to find on a Cinematic Album. It blends today's style of dramatic and cinematic music on a top standard BUT, at the same time, Penka Kouneva has been able to bring in a lot of melodic writing and contrasting materials, such as the use of chamber ensembles, something that is not very common to find on a blockbuster score. Her writing is superb, very well balanced and showcases an incredible, musical craft. The blend between full orchestral, chamber and hybrid styles is impeccable. The audio quality is also amazing, featuring a pristine mix and a top notch team. This is a composer to keep looking for. Bravo."
This song kinda sucks <SEP> This song has a legit beat and could be cool but the lyrics are uninspiring and pretty dull.  If you want meaningful lyrics listen to Macklemore.
way too cold!! <SEP> These dudes are at the top!! This song is for us dudes that are on the top. Jay Z killed it Mr. West killed it and Big Sean.
"GRAET LATIN MUSIC <SEP> I ALWAYS LIKED THEIR MUSIC.I BOUGHT IT UNHEARD,WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I DID."
Don't Bother <SEP> Much better versions out there. This is highly annoying. Bought it when my kid was into this song but couldn't stand to listen to it more than once.
Five Stars <SEP> Both my kids love this
Two Stars <SEP> it's ok
SICK VERSION! <SEP> I love this band!! and their version of this song rocks!! i've made my mind up to eventually get a few of their albums.
"Great music by a great band <SEP> Great music by a great band, captured live in an intimate setting. Love the banter with the audience. Wish I could have been there."
"Acoustic Carbon Leaf! <SEP> I loved hearing some of my favorite Carbon Leaf songs performed acoustically on this album!  If you like their live albums, you'll probably like this one."
One Star <SEP> This guy sucks
"not bad but I prefer the originals <SEP> These are not the original songs, he recorded again and  they sound completely different, not bad but I  prefer the originals"
Five Stars <SEP> My favorite record from one of the greatest artists out there
"Love it <SEP> Music to open the  doors in our mind. Thoughtful and inspired ,Suzanne's music

"Do you mean Billy Joel didn't record these songs after all??? <SEP> Despite the 2009 release date on this album, a handful of songs on ""Tough Boy"" were recorded in the late 1970's and were released as ""The Tough Boy"" by Billy Joel and the Hassels [sic] in 1980. True Billy Joel was in a band called the Hassles in the 60's, although they have no connection with the work of Joey Trentadue. To add to the confusion, when the horrible, quasi-legitimate, Creative Sounds Ltd. reissued Joel's other pre-fame band Attila on to cd (sourced from vinyl, of course), they tacked on the 1980 ""The Tough Boy"" release and credited to Billy Joel and the Hassels [sic] complete with a Hassles era photo of Joel.

For the record, Joey Trentadue sounds nothing like Billy Joel. In fact Trentadue sounds like the perfect candidate for the former WFMU show ""Incorrect Music"", a program hosted by Irwin Chusid (Songs in the Key of Z) and Michele Boule which featured ""differently"" talented musicians. About half of the tracks are quasi-New Wave (it was from these recordings the fake Joel album was assembled), while the rest are hideously off key acoustic numbers, one of which seems to be about dynamiting seals (Take These Seals and Shove It).

I am certainly glad I found out who was responsible for the lyric ""Tough boy's a punk, real tough punk! Punk rock city! Tough boy, tough punk, tough boy, tough punk!"". That alone is reason to have a reservation in hell."
One Star <SEP> Didn't realize I could only listen to it once after my purchase.
"nah |: P <SEP> if u want bland vocals go ahead and buy this. the original by imagine dragons has a much fuller sound a quality. the instrumentals are pretty good, but i made a mistake buying this."
M Del!!!!! <SEP> I am not sure how I missed this album but was so happy when I found it. i was wondering if Mr. Del had anything new out there and he did. I was very pleased with this album and is like the other Holy South albums. I can't wait until Mr. Del's release in June
"Error <SEP> I ordered this video by mistake, not exactly what I had in mind. In the future will be more careful when I click the clicker."
"Wow <SEP> What a nice old school song, I love my oldies when music was just that music.  This song has a nice meaning and is beautiful"
Five Stars <SEP> This is one of better songs I downloaded this month. It has a great beat ad sweet melody
"My boyfriend and I can make a better recording of performing blow jobs <SEP> My boyfriend and I can make a better recording of performing blow jobs, 69, and handjobs on each other as well as masturbating and buttfucking, not to mention the threesomes and orgies."
"Power Pop! <SEP> Not as good as some of his other stuff from recent times, but still great.  A HJP throwaway would be a song other power pop bands would kill for."
"Premier Nesian Reggae <SEP> The name threw me off at first but I recognized the skills since the first time I heard him on a mixed CD with other Poly artists. Spawnbreezie is the real deal Holyfield when it comes to music, he got the all around reggae sound down with blues,rocknroll,gospel,hip hop influence. Every song on this CD hits harder than yo pops right palm"
I love the diversity of this group <SEP> I love the diversity of this group. Each song is unique and perfect.  Absolutely love the acoustic version of 'Keep Your Eyes Open' I can't get enough of these guys!
Buy it. <SEP> Love love love this EP. So so good. It has the perfect mixture of sad-ish and super happy and cute songs!
Nice <SEP> Nice sound with a mix of hip hop and rock acapellas are nice for sampling and easy listening to. Enjoy
"Horrible Quality <SEP> I was originally very happy to have found this great song in its original version; however, upon downloading it I realized it has horrible quality.  The ""scratches"" you hear in the preview sample are there and throughout the song.  I had thought that perhaps only the preview sample had them.  I guess I had wishful thinking.
I did notify Amazon that this song has horrible quality and they were nice enough to return my money, but I am puzzled why it's still available for sale....?"
"Still strong, even with strings <SEP> Stanley Turrentine brings ingenuity and style to this standard even with the overdone arrangements he works his magic, making the most of every phrase with that fat, beautiful tone that is reminiscent of the old school tenor players. He makes this a perfect candidate for a ""Jazz for Lovers"" album."
"Love this CD <SEP> Love this CD. Jim's voice is full and always on key. The songs are good stories and interesting. The melodies are catchy and complex and unique and never tiring. All the instruments are clean sounding especially the lead guitar. All the songs are very well crafted, in my opinion better than most top 40 songs of today. ""Can't Keep A Good Man Down"" CD is a undiscovered treasure, it's not in my top 10 -  it's in my top five to enjoy complete over and over. Thank you Mr. McFarland.  Steve-"
Two Stars <SEP> Expected to love it... found it annoying!
Wrong version <SEP> I was trying to get this in a  C D. It came in a vienel version .the rest of the order was excellent .  Bill
"It bored me - sorry! <SEP> I don't usually write negative reviews, and when I previewed these selections I really expected to enjoy this recording.  Unfortunately I was bored.  I thought many of the tracks sounded similar, and did not keep my attention."
"Dance music is back! <SEP> Of course dance music never went anywhere.  It's always been around.  However this is a dance tune with an actual story line. That story is: ""Get rid of her and be with me."" The bass line on this song is killer.  Turn up your bass and listen to it. This song is almost a mixture of rock and dance in a sense.  Love the singing too. All in all, a very cool tune...."
"Very easy listen, Lee shares his tory and struggle coming ... <SEP> Very easy listen, Lee shares his tory and struggle coming to faith. His journey as a skeptic who was willing to take a hard look at the facts and his decision to take the last and best step to put on Christ. I enjoyed this and bought it to share with others."
"Mislabeled - NOT The Fingerlock, but Hihorodo hiharara. Fantastic tune/performance though. <SEP> Note that this is NOT The Fingerlock. It's mislabeled. It's actually Hihorodo hiharara (if you know canntaireachd, this is immediately obvious upon listening).

I'm not really sure Amazon deserves five stars for making this mistake. But the tune itself (and performance) are definitely five stars."
a blast from my past <SEP> This version of the song was always a favorite of mine. Its very soulful sounding and reminds me of being a child.
"Not grabbing me <SEP> I want this to be good. It just is not turning my crank. I was expecting sounds that were unique and different - this sound like vanilla pudding. I heard a Sunday morning PBS radio bit on the recording - the abandon inland etc, the life threatening challenge of getting there. Did not help me to like it any better - lot of hype."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
It was done right the FIRST TIME!!! <SEP> Earthy beautiful unique voice of Mica Paris in the ORIGINAL version of this song.
"Lupe is back! <SEP> Lupe rights his ship after a disappointing sophomore effort in ""The Cool"" and also the nearly forgettable 3rd Album ""Lasers"". Food & Liquor II is the sequel that we were all waiting for. All that is needed is for someone to just press play and each track rides out like first ""Food & Liquor"". Honestly, one of the best purchases I ever made."
"Music <SEP> It's simple, if you enjoy this band, you'll love the song. It feels like a cross between Chevelle and Perfect Circle to me."
"NOT VERY DREAMY <SEP> This song by Benny Davis and Joe Burke was intended to be a sensuous, romantic ballad, and it was when recorded by Russ Columbo just prior to his accidental death in 1934.  Owning to my fondness of that version and being a long time fan of the British Dance Bands of the 30's I looked to the Henry Hall recording for some inspiration.  I didn't find it.  Hall's rendition of ""just another dream of you"" featured a very nasal vocalist in an inappropriate up tempo rendition.  It was truly a waste of time and more importantly tarnished the glow that Columbo had created in my mind for this song.  Fortunately, I downloaded this from Amazon through its ""cloud"" system so it only cost me 99 cents.  And more importantly the helpful Amazon employee who ably assisted me in negotiating this purchase (I'm truly computer illiterate) then helped me purchase the complete album on which this song appeared.  Much to my pleasure this album ""Singing in the Moonlight"" contained 24 more songs for a total price of $9.99. Most of these are neat dance numbers and jaunty syncopated melodies well worth the purchase.  My recommendation is, don't buy the song, buy the album. It's worth the price."
"It is still a good album, but if your expecting a maiden sound ... <SEP> Kind of a let down from what I expected from the main song writer of Maiden, It is still a good album, but if your expecting a maiden sound this isn't it."
"I blame the singer <SEP> I'll keep this simple. If not for the singer this would be a pretty damn good album. I like the music a lot. It has a good mellow 70s type of rock/metal vibe to it which shows Steve's influences. The singer though, his voice is thin and really doesn't seem to fit any of the music except for the clean slower acoustic track at the end in which the singer actually fits very well. The singer just lacks the power in his voice needed here. He's not a bad singer at all, but he just doesn't fit this music very well as far as I'm concerned. Other than that, I think the production was pretty solid, but a sub-par singer will ruin anything no matter how good the music. Good thing for me I picked this up used for $2."
For $0.99 <SEP> That is all. It was cheap. I wanted the song. I have it. What more is there to say? If it was a penny more I would not have bought it. I'm cheap...what can I say?
"Not what I expected <SEP> But that's a good thing! I'm definitely one of those people who advocate for ending misogyny and homophobia within mainstream hip-hop, so I cringed at the title of the song because I always took Lupe Fiasco as such a progressive artist. My presumption, however was thrown back in my face, and hard. The depth that this song goes into with, not simply the use of the word ""b*tch"" in hip-hop, but reveals the attitudes and social norms that perpetuate it. I love how it shows that while this type of thinking and ideologies are the norm, they are far from normal in that they are slowly degrading as a society with these established paradigms that have been so instilled into our society, that people simply don't question them because of how prevalent they are. It doesn't go into a lot of history, but it's a wonderful starting point in a talk to address issues that surround women and race. One of the greatest songs I've heard. Lupe has done it again."
"I love lupe. Great advocate for those who feel unheard <SEP> :) Buy the album, the song, I don't care. B.O.B. ft Taylor Swift's Both of Us is a good song too and i cant find it anywhere!"
Cool <SEP> When lupe first came out he was dope and till now still is. Good song he gives us another point of view about certain worlds that some women use.
ANNOITED!! <SEP> The annoiting is so strong when listening to this man of God. This is the best I have heard!! God Bless you Jermaine!!
Destiny <SEP> This is a great album by Jermaine Edwards.  Island Worship in it's truest form.  He mixes the old time reggae with powerful lyrics and makes it feel brand new.  Smooth vocals take you to a place of worship and you find yourself still singing the songs long after the music stops.
Five Stars <SEP> Love
"Bad noise at end of second movement <SEP> The music is great and the pianist superb but the digital copy is bad, at the end of the second movement there is terrible scratch noise that can leave you deaf if you are using earphones. Hope is corrected.  Please let me know"
"Fine music, poor sound <SEP> From Antonio Caldara's extensive and wide-ranging work, until recently it's mostly been his vocal works  both sacred and secular  that have found their way onto disc. But his instrumental works are also very fine and deserve serious attention. The present disc, recorded in 2011, brings us a selection of six of his youthful (1693) set of twelve Suonate a tre Op. 1, for two violins, cello and continuo.

The pieces are in four-movement 'sonata da chiesa' layout, and these are lively, melodically attractive works  fine, enjoyable music, played in spirited and stylish manner by the four players of El Arte Musico. They are also fairly short works, around 7 to 10 minutes each, and six of them thus amount to rather short measure of 47 minutes of music. More seriously, however, the recorded sound is harsh and metallic, making the disc rather unpleasant to listen to.

There are far better recordings of Caldara's instrumental sonatas available, including those by Amandine Beyer and La Fidelssima. The present disc, in spite of its attractive cover and nicely-illustrated booklet with excellent notes, is a great disappointment  fine music and musicianship in unacceptably grating recorded sound. Perhaps a remastered re-issue would be worth a shot?"
Two Stars <SEP> Bought by mistake.  OK
One Star <SEP> Horrible.
One Star <SEP> I like it
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent album. A must-have!
"Leicester Bangs Review (2012): <SEP> Cannons North - Goodbye Dog (Independent)
Minneapolis has always had a healthy music scene, and since the mid `80s and the rise of The Jayhawks, alt. country / Americana has been one of the dominant genres in the city. Cannons North represent one of the new generation of bands picking up steel guitars and mandolins, and with four singer-songwriters in their ranks, they've got plenty to say.

So, with four out of five members contributing songs it's hardly surprising that their debut album has appeared only a year after their inception. Perhaps it's a little more unexpected that it sounds so fully formed. There's a genuine group dynamic at play. Though it's easy enough to separate the different singers, and even their writing styles, ""Goodbye Dog"" hangs together extremely well. Opening cut ""Cannonball Express"" displays many of the same characteristics that defined the first Wilco album, an uncomplicated country-rock style, played with genuine enthusiasm and a lot of heart. ""Drive"" feels like a call to arms, a Cannons North theme song with an in-built love of the road, and the opportunity to spread the joy. The title track's a country tearjerker - the singer really loved that dog - and ""Not The Life"" provides another moody, brooding highlight. Good songs, good singers and good musicians - be sure to check out ""Goodbye Dog"" and dig the new breed."
One Star <SEP> Really STINKS!
"No Ways Tired MP3 Music <SEP> This was instrumental not James Cleveland sing, and I did not enjoy it. It was like listening to funeral music."
Radney's Review : <SEP> I always enjoy Bishop Jones and his unique style of preaching. It is indeed a blessing to have sermons conveniently stored on my phone.
YOU SCREWED ME!!!!! <SEP> YOU SENT ME A COPY OF THE ACTUAL SONG SUNG BY THE ACTUAL GROUP!!!!!! THIS IS NOT AN ACOMPANIMENT TRACK!!!!!!!!!
Lords Prayer <SEP> Beautifully sung.
"Beautiful! <SEP> Another thumbs up for David! This man's voice is amazing and I can listen to him all day, every day. His version of ""the Lord's Prayer"" is my favorite. But then every thing David sings ends up being one of my favorites. Bless you David. Keep these beautiful songs coming!"
NOT A HAPPY CAMPER <SEP> I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DAVID PHELPS SINGING NOT JUST A GUITAR PLAYING.  MY MISTAKE BUT KIND OF MISLEADING TO SOMEONE WHO IS NOT UP ON MUSICAL TERMINOLOGY.
"Brought tears to my eyes... <SEP> David's rendition of this classic song is remarkable. His sister sings backup vocals and the two together is amazing! Another great one, David. Keep 'em coming."
"Lovely sound <SEP> When I saw the movie, I heard lovely background music and thought it might be a gentle, calm sound, which it is."
"Bless Me, Ultima <SEP> I've only recently become aware of the work of Mark Kilian; titles that come to mind are John Carpenter's The Ward, Traitor, and the George Bush documentary 41. Kilian's also known for other scores such as Tsotsi, Rendition, and Before the Rains. I embarrassingly have to admit, however, that prior to hearing his score for Bless Me, Ultima, I hadn't actually heard any of Mark Kilian's work, but can say with absolute confidence that I'll soon remedy that. Bless Me, Ultima therefore totally came out of left field, not only because of it being my introduction to Kilian, but because it's such a deep and emotional journey with incredible and lush instrumentation.

I'll be honest in saying something else here; normally, the music that's found on Bless Me, Ultima isn't my cup of tea. But, part of the delight in listening to a musical score is the ability to lose oneself in the emotional backdrop of the respective composer as well as their and the filmmakers' intention for where that score takes you. I have no doubt that painstaking effort was invested by Mark Kilian when he composed this score, and one only has to hear the vast assembly of sound to be assured of this notion. The Bless Me, Ultima film, set in New Mexico in the 1940s, weaves a tale of a young boy and a folk healer, and given its origins incorporates a huge assortment of ethnic and tribal instruments. Most prominent in this regard are flamenco-style vocals and Native American flutes (which according to Lakeshore Records, Mark Kilian played himself), but also prevalent are acoustic guitars and slight orchestral elements, the last of which are sometimes used so slightly and buried that Bless Me, Ultima rarely seems to bear the semblance to a film score at all. Right from the start, the flamenco vocals and Native American pipes construct a mighty, touching, and ethnic-tinged theme song that's repeated several times throughout the score, and the listener is greeted with music like that of a legendary journey through majesty, wonder, and stark, bountiful folklore from a far-off land. The first handful of tracks seem to create the skeleton for Kilian's vision, each playfully indulging in only the slightest acoustic melodies while softly colliding with string arrangements like wispy, delicate clouds coalescing and swirling into one.

The middle few tracks are where Kilian's compositions really start to explore each other, seeping into one another and drenching the listener's ears with slack-jawed beauty and harmonic mysticism. ""Antonio's Disappointment"" starts out mimicking Mark Knopfler's romantic, acoustic passages from Princess Bride before chilling, melancholic strings begin to swell and overwhelm the listener a few tracks later on personal favorite ""Ultima's Owl,"" recalling the most soothing and provocative work of James Horner. Over the course of the score, what I initially thought the most curious and inquisitive instrument, the Native American flute, became seamlessly interwoven to the awe-inspiring build of all later tracks, culminating with the flamenco vocals, scant percussion, and quaking bass horns of the score's most prolific song, ""Confessions.""

At some points, I can't really tell if Kilian's score for Bless Me, Ultima is trying to be more of a film score or a new intermingled world music album, but therein lies its sheer genius and absolutely stupefying ability to make the listener believe it was constructed by both serendipity and careful, diligent brilliance in parallel. Mark Kilian's Bless Me, Ultima is incredible in the difference of its approach, in its beautiful causality, and in its wonderful, benevolent structure. Extremely highly recommended in every way, Bless Me, Ultima conjures a world of endless inspiration that will turn and perpetually hold the ear of any discerning musical listener."
"All around fun fresh voice with a lot of emotion <SEP> The comparisons to Kate Bush are justified but maybe it's more Kate Bush + Chilly Gonzalez? There's a quirky storytelling, and electronic element, a rock element. All around fun fresh voice with a lot of emotion."
Did not download properly <SEP> Download skipped I could not find a place on website to correct error. It is useless and I do not want to pay to download again.
"Mature...Intelligent...Original...keep it coming! <SEP> What a pleasant surprise to discover this band. I saw them open for San Cisco and was immediately struck by how full the songs sounded - especially considering they are a two piece band - a deceptively accomplished keyboardist/vocalist and a precise drummer pounding out musical rhythms. The songs are well written and difficult to categorize, but I am sure of this - Chaos Chaos writes and plays the music they want to play. They have the freedom to do whatever they want to and they have the creativity to make interesting. Enjoy!"
"A Revolutionary's Masterpiece <SEP> If you need some down to earth, straight to the point kinda music, then this collection is for you. A true lyricist to the end, Chad knows how to put words together with real life situations that we continue to experience in this lifetime. I can't wait for his next release, and I will be playing this one for a longtime to come."
"David Phelps - Going Home <SEP> I think this project was one of David Phelp's best.  Going Home places such a longing in my heart.  The feeling that comes with the music is matchless.  I have followed David's career and, in my opinion, it will be very difficult to top this."
"A Beautiful Song <SEP> What a Wonderful World is a beautiful by most any measure. David Phelps does it well.
I liked it very much."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome! Beautiful voice.
"real good <SEP> super psychedelic! (things get better with the whippersnappers)  can I get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 more words?"
One Star <SEP> I was disappointed because its not the song that goes with the title.
Two Stars <SEP> I wanted the song with the lyrics. Not just instrumental.
Two Stars <SEP> not what I expected
"Did read the description fully <SEP> This is not what I was looking for, I wanted the vocal version of this song. I did not even know there was an instrumental."
"Not what I thought it was. <SEP> The singing of mister Phelps is beautiful.  His voice is truly a gift.  The problem I had with this song is that after looking up the translation and information about it I felt rather foolish.  I've always loved the sound of this song and wanted a version sang by a male that I could learn for myself.  Well I didn't know what it was actually about when I purchased it.

As it turns out this song as written is meant to be a young woman singing to her father, asking him not to ruin her chances with a young man whose family the father is feuding with.  In the song, she sings about how wonderful the young suitor is, and how much she loves him.  She pleads with her father to let her have her love with him, and so on.

You can see why I'm a little puzzled as to why David Phelps felt he needed to have a go at this one.  His singing is a beautiful sound however and if you aren't bothered by the incongruity, then by all means purchase and enjoy."
At the Cross <SEP> Have loved the song for years and was pleased to add it to my collection.
The past tracks have been great. This will not stop me from downloading music ... <SEP> After downloading this track and then playing it. There was a pause in the track so therefore I could not use it for my performance. The past tracks have been great. This will not stop me from downloading music from your company.
Good solid accompaniment <SEP> This is an excellent track to sing with.  Clean rendition without the variations that make some tracks hard to sing with comfortably.
"Dianna Krall <SEP> Dianna is a bit different than the usual artists. She has a sound that is a combination of rock,& blues as well as a piano bar artist. I don't purchase everything that she puts out, but when I hear something new that she's done I listen to it a few times & then purchase it. It pays to give this artists work a try."
"Awesome Worship <SEP> Wonderful music, fulfilling heart felt worship to our creator and father. This CD will turn your attitude around. If you're feeling discouraged, Refuge will pick you up along with other songs on the CD.  You won't regret purchasing this album."
Five Stars <SEP> Great CD! You will love it if you like this band or similar bands. Seller was A+
"Beautiful Rendition <SEP> I was surprised that Disney had Bridgit and Shane perform this after the Demi Lovato/Joe Jonas version was so well received but I'm glad they did because the Demi/Joe version is not available as a single.

I love Demi Lovato's voice but Bridgit really does this song justice."
"Great Beat <SEP> I had not heard Diana Krall before (or at least I didn't know who she was) - until I listened to ""I'm A Little Mixed Up"".  I love the beat and she has an awesome voice.  Will consider buying other songs by her in the future."
"Wow <SEP> If i had to say one good thing it would be track 10. thats about it. expected much more from 'Oxford'.  will offer one piece of much needed advice: hire a singer for the sophomore effort. from here on everything said during new music tuesday will be taken as tongue in cheek.  its the only way u could ever expect to not be dismissed entirely as a radio host/music critique, for nothing on here is new or groundbreaking. and that from my experience listening is your token go to critique. But hey good luck with Lin, maybe this will get u a few much needed extra dollars a year.  god knows you're needing every cent with your wifes clothing Co. going nowhere fast."
Better than 90% of the stuff RawDog plays on New Music Tuesday. <SEP> This album does not suck. It is in fact quite good. If 80's music sounded more like this it would have been a better decade.#punchrawdoginthedick
"another lullaby <SEP> another lullaby by someone who knows how to sing them, there is a lot of feeling in this song and her voice is just awesome"
"Leicester Bangs Review (2012): <SEP> AKW - Silent War EP (Independent)
AKW is Alexandra K. Wisner, ex of The Intervals and The Tints. The latter featured Flea's daughter Clara Balzary on drums, a link that resulted in John Frusciante producing one of their records, and in 2005 they were invited to play the Vincent Callo curated All Tomorrow's Parties Festival. Then they split. If my sums are right, Wisner was 17 years old.

What followed for Wisner was a new company, various music projects for films, solo records and earlier this year a new album, ""For No One"", recorded with band mate Adam Cude, and completely funded by fans via Kickstarter, in just ten days. Now, six months later, a new EP. Cut from much the same cloth as its predecessor, ""Silent War"" continues the duo's journey into spacey folktronica, where Cude's wispy acoustic guitar plays gently with Wisner's keyboards, and voice. It's a lush, delicate combination, with a succession of musical peaks and ethereal tones.

On ""Obvious"" they're at their most experimental. A young girl's voice speaks half heard sentences about death and loss over drones and simple keyboard runs, and is intermittently interrupted by Wisner's soaring vocals. Older listeners may shed a tear for their old Cocteau Twins albums. ""Sinking Boat"" is altogether more finely structured, and its otherworldly delivery does little to disguise a perfectly executed pop song. The title track is just as finely balanced and its equal. If names like Cat Power and PJ Harvey feature heavily on your playlists then AKW seems a natural next step."
beautiful harmonies <SEP> Beautiful harmonies
really annoying <SEP> is there a way to return this? My little snippet I listened to did not really tell me this was Baaad
annoying <SEP> really?  silly... not sure what the point of this app is but it is for children...and parents who are not paying attention.
"Very Forgettable <SEP> I don't understand all the positive reviews this album has received. The lyrics are incredibly generic and cliche. The music starts out mediocre and  devolves into irritating (""Quit You"") and then incomprehensible (""Bad Drug""). Prettyman has a lovely voice, and (most of) her melodies aren't bad, they just aren't interesting, and the album can't seem to decide between going full-on country or sticking to a singer-songwriter sound. It all just ends up sounding sort of lost."
Four Stars <SEP> I like this song.
Good Work Out Song <SEP> I'm not really into Pop Music but I added this song to my playlist for working out. You can do high impact or low impact aerobics to this song.
"Schumann, Piano 4 hands <SEP> This is a very respectable rendition of two wonderful Schumann chamber pieces.  If you resonate with this music, the Eckerle Duo is a great way to experience it in a pianistic approach.  Piano four hand arrangements were common in a pre-recording music time -- a way most people could hear or play these gems.  Bravo, Eckerles."
"wow <SEP> Just like with American Idiot,they hit this whole album out of the ball park. Every song is a hit. This one easy to sing along with."
One Star <SEP> Horrible
"Not what I expected. <SEP> I thought this was the actual Beach Boys song...it isn't and even for whatever it is supposed to be, it isn't that great. Read the fine print more carefully than I did."
One Star <SEP> Not Just the Song! Mostly movie sounds
Five Stars <SEP> Brings back mystery!!
"It is a universal truth that you should avoid ""live"" Beach Boy music <SEP> First let me get this out of my system.  The Beach Boys do their best work in a studio where they can practice their harmony, and tweak it to where it sounds the best.

They cannot do this in a live show and it shows.

If you think you have found a hidden gem in this song by the Boys doing a rendition of a Lennon and McCartney song, then you are wrong, at best this is a piece of coal, at the worst it is a mining canary that died to warn others of what is on this album.

I like the Beach Boys, I really do but (like them singing Uncle John's band with the Grateful Dead) I cannot recommend this song."
One Star <SEP> instrumental!
Great add to my music collection <SEP> Hard to find single. Great add to my music collection.
Not the original recording <SEP> Made the mistake of buying this........wish I new how to get my money back. Not the original recording. Go to C.W. McCall if your looking for the original.
One Star <SEP> Not at all what I wanted.
"Who's Gonna Hold Me Now <SEP> A romantic, melancholy slow dance song with some outstanding musicians sitting in.  This song has a great musical arrangement and it's all tied together by the soulful singing of Chicago's Julia Huff."
"Five Stars <SEP> Just as beautiful!!! This cd is as good as Inner Peace 1
Ani is a gifted woman."
"Real organ literature on a fake organ! <SEP> As a youth in the 60's, I absorbed every organ record I could, and there were a fair number in my local St. Louis suburban library. This was one of them. Mario Salvador was known in St. Louis as the longtime organist at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, containing a large Kilgen instrument (renovated and rebuilt in the 80's and also more recently), a decent musician with training in Rome. The organ sound is awful, but lots of cathedral reverb makes up for it to a small degree. The only piece I can remember with any clarity is ""Naiades"" (Water Nymphs) from Vierne's 24 Pieces de fantaisie, a fast-flowing quiet piece which takes a fair bit of technique. Interesting musical curio for an organ lover!"
"More info for Strike Witches fans. <SEP> -Set after season 2 and before the movie occurs.
-Non 501st character Heidemarie W. Schnaufer is featured.
-7 dialogue tracks, 6 songs
-Movie ED Yakusoku no Sora e Watashi no Ita Basho sung by the three characters featured (same applies to other 4 discs).

-Of all the discs, this one has the most fluid transition between dialogue and music."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2012): <SEP> Worth - Six Foot Soul (Niayh Records)
With 24 tracks and a running time just short of 79 minutes, Christopher Worth's debut solo album ""Six Foot Soul"" is an expansive, sprawling record, difficult to fully grasp in one sitting. Of course, back in the old, pre-digital days, it would have been a double-album set, and however big a fan we were, we would have rarely listened to ""Blonde On Blonde"", ""Exile On Main Street"" or ""The White Album"" in one uninterrupted session. Instead we would have cherry-picked favourite sides, wearing out the grooves, and flipping the discs only occasionally. We don't seem to listen to albums in the same way these days; it's either odd tracks on playlists or the whole thing, though ""Six Foot Soul"" seems to work, whichever way it's played.

In 2007 Worth formed the band NIAYH (an acronym for ""Now Is All You Have""), who are often compared to Pink Floyd. Solo, there's a distinct folk, soul and jazz edge to much of his material. I've not seen his name mentioned anywhere else, but Shuggie Otis came to mind as ""Six Foot Soul"" gradually revealed its charms, though there's also an element of the American jam band tradition present throughout the collection.

As already stated, it's a lot of music to be cogitated and digested in one go, but it's hardly a chore. Worth's got an easy voice to live with and his band play it funky and lively, or mellow and chilled with equal aplomb. Sampled voices and non-musical interludes agreeably break up the sequencing, emphasizing individual songs, of which there are ample highlights; ""Come Out Into the Light"" and ""Captain Finger"" are both particularly laudable, but taken as a whole, I can wholeheartedly recommend every last second."
"Hip Hop Lives <SEP> Been with y'all since Hex first sent me the ""Shit is Real"" track didn't think you could top the freshman joint... god damn... best believe spreading the word out here in the 619 San Diego, get 'em!!!"
"Terrible <SEP> What ever happened to taking the time to put songs on a album that you actually want to listen t to,why has it become the norm to put out a whole album with just one hit,I'm glad I only paid $5"
"Better & Better, it should be named......Superb Music <SEP> I hate to put them in a genre, just a wonderful fuzzy, melodic, vinyl sound.
 Wonderful riffs, harmony & melody.
Lyrics that come together in a captivating synchronicity and resonance.
The three of them come together resonating agreeably with a pleasant mesmerizing sound.
Each song is excellent with my favorite being ""Sleep In"".
Times New Viking - A band that possesses brilliant creativity, not afraid to step out of their own status quo.
Peace"
"New 2012 Studio Recording! <SEP> This is a new studio recording, not another archive live recording from the late '70's band of the same name. While a couple members are the same, this is a different band. Dave Brock is nowhere to be found, but Ron Tree is the singer, hence the punky sound. Excellent album!"
"refund pleaseeee <SEP> I did not mean to order this song, it was hit by mistake, this song is  spoooooo boring, refund please."
"Good product <SEP> Excellent product, my daughter loves it. arrived in very good condition, she cares a lot, congratulations as it brings some additional items"
"I bought this several years ago, but only recently ... <SEP> I bought this several years ago, but only recently put it on usb so I could listen to it in my car. I'm enchanted!! This music is divine. I find myself playing it multiple times in a row because I can't get enough of it. It brings in the energy of Avalon and surrounds you with it. I agree with the previous reviewer...I want more!! <3"
"Misleading Product Name <SEP> When I had purchased this album, I bought it with the product description as ""Kpop CD, G-DRAGON GD ONE OF A KIND FIRST MINI ALBUM GOLD EDITION K-POP CD &+ FOLDED POSTER + FREE GIFT (2 Items) *NEW* "" and with a comment claiming that it would take ""2-5 days for US delivery"", however, I had FINALLY received it TEN days later and it had only come with the CD alone. The case had come in pretty good condition, but I was extremely disappointed to find the products listed in the description missing from my package-there was no poster nor any free gift. It was an extremely misleading product description and I am frustrated at the two missing items(aside from the fact that it had come later than expected)."
"Five Stars <SEP> Love this song....strong message, amazing sound!"
Liked at first... <SEP> ... but then started to become repetitive and annoying with grating sound effects. Shame we can't return MP3s back to Amazon.
Not the recording I was searching for <SEP> Not the recording I was looking for.  Wish I had not bought it. I later learned I should have been looking for Faith of the Heart
instant download <SEP> Saw these guys live and had to have this song. love it!!!! listen to this almost daily and still get a kick out of it.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent!!!
"I you love Jpop or Kpop... <SEP> Then you will love Orange Caramel and this CD is great! Very nice premium packaging. Sure, you can download music now-a-days but when albums are packaged as greatly as these, they are worth the money.  ^_^"
"Well-rounded imagination music... <SEP> There are lots of great and average epic/trailer albums out there, and all things considered, I'm really a newbie to the genre.  At first I had a heck of a time deciding where to invest my money, as so much sounds so good in the snippets on Amazon, and dollar-per-playing-time, this one works out a bit more pricey than many others.  The thing that hooked me, however, was that when I listened to the preview snippets, I found myself swearing quietly under my breath each time a track abruptly ended, wishing I could hear the rest of the ""story"".  I went away from this one several times, only to come back and do the same thing (listen...swear when preview ended...grumble about price of album) about three times -- yes, I'm a nut AND a glutton for punishment.

So, yeah...bought the damn thing at last and have listened to it many times with no regrets.  It is extremely good, and what I find I really enjoy sometimes is that it's not TOO epic.  I like to get inspiration for writing, and sometimes I'm not looking for over-the-top-million-bad-guys-fighting-epic-battle-to-death...I want a quiet, poignant, or adventurous moment.  This is where this music is very good.  There ARE quite epic moments, but every track is not the ultimate showdown or ultimate evil or ultimate triumph...  Sometimes it's just a great flight of the imagination, and that's what I appreciate.  The tracks are somewhat longer individually than on other albums of this type, so the pieces are more fleshed-out (as other reviewers have said), and that allows for a more complete visualization.

I really like ""Untold""...had it running on repeat at work the other day, and it's great: not offensive to anyone, not over-the-top, easy to start imagining to, and each track is satisfyingly long enough.  Definitely recommended.  (I even like to listen to this when I can't sleep...doesn't get you too hyped up like some Two Steps from Hell or Audiomachine stuff can...)"
Cool. <SEP> Never heard this before.  pretty familiar with lotta UK punk.  Reminds me a bit of say mix of Vibrators and somebody maybe Stranglers.  Good stuff.
"Ritmo! rocks! <SEP> Ritmo! goes on my entertaining playlist...say you have a VIP guest list and want to get the mood right! Ritmo! Try it with Contemporary Latin Cuisine.  Ritmo! will get your guests dancing mambo (San Francisco PM) by the end of the evening.
Ritmo! celebrates diversity. It fuses Clare and Brent Fischer signature harmonies with Latin rhythms in a big band setting.  Followers of Salsa Picante, Cal Tjader and Poncho Sanchez will love this album.
I also like the track called Rainforest that's inspired by nature's beauty. Great collection for Latin jazz and big band lovers everywhere."
"Good stuff... <SEP> I listened to Zhelezniyi and Batleship (What do you do with it?) on YouTube; awesome songs, some of their best yet! I can't wait until I can download these from Amazon or iTunes! :D Also check out their past collaborations with Noize MC, and of course the amazing video for Capital."
"massacre. (Minus ratings aren't available). <SEP> This woman has desecrated one of the most beautiful chilling tracks of all time. Perhaps this is the reason she, (this Semiramis), has manipulated the original to be 'not available'. You can Google & play it to hear how its original surpasses any attempt she has made to glorify herself, laughable.
IF ONLY THE ORIGINAL ""ALONE (VMA ARCHITEQ MIX)BY SUNHARBOUR"" WERE AVAILABLE IT WOULD BE IN HIGH DEMAND!!!!!!!!!!"
"not whar I was looking for <SEP> was searching for a specific recording,believed it to be on item ordered,was not-could not seem to get that recording found separately. The title is ""you dropped a bomb on me""-would purchase that item."
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent, excellent, excellent.
'nuff said."
"such a great CD! <SEP> such a great CD!!! loved it as a record when I was a child, so glad to see it's available on Amazon!"
"Welcome To My Show Lets get started shall we <SEP> Excellent surprise for those of who had this album as a child. I adore Alfred Hitchcock, everything!!
Eccentric personality! Love hearing him again. And now I can even watch the Hitchcock hour again on TV not to mention his great movies on TCM and other stations that maybe play him
 So glad this was released on CD.
 Great memories for myself and older sister."
deveraux rocks!! <SEP> Deveraux is an amazing band... they are the best thing to happen to metal ever!! You cannot go wrong buying their album
THE BEST CD I HAVE HEARD IN SEVERAL YEARS <SEP> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS I HAVE HEARD IN SEVERAL YEARS.  THE HORN AND BASS PLAYERS ARE THE ALL TIME BEST.  IT IS GOOD TO SEE THIS GROUP BACK AND STRONGER THAN EVER.
After Throwing Out the Penguin <SEP> Remember to look above for the hope and healing!  You are talented and passionate about what you do!  Looking forward to hearing another (still think you sound like Billy Ocean).  A home run single for your first!
"Does not work on my phone. Ringtone does not ... <SEP> Does not  work on my phone.
Ringtone does not work on my Version Samsung phone. Would cancel if I could."
Its a cover band collection. I'm a local radio ... <SEP> Its a cover band collection. I'm a local radio announcer/DJ who relies on the real versions. This compilation is awful.
Imatation artist <SEP> the whole Album sounds like was remastered by want a be's. Very poor Quality
One Star <SEP> Worthless for a good Dr. Who ringtone. I ended up recording from youtube and saving the intro music
"Bought it, thought it was going to my phone ... <SEP> Bought it , thought it was going to my phone, it didn't, now I don't know where it is"
"Does not work on my phone. Ringtone does not ... <SEP> Does not  work on my phone.
Ringtone does not work on my Version Samsung phone. Would cancel if I could."
ringtone <SEP> Do not get. Would not send to my phone. They gave me a credit. So I never received it. The end.
One Star <SEP> not funny at all!
"Best of Golden Oldies <SEP> Not what I expected. Not original artists.  Order this one by mistake.  Had I realized better what I was buying, I would not have bought this."
"love this version <SEP> I just randomly picked this version to listen to, but I absolutely love it!  My daughter had a version of Canon she planned for her wedding processional, but after hearing this version, we changed it, and it was beautiful!  The horns, in particular really make this unique from other versions I've heard."
I like all product <SEP> Is good quality product
Five Stars <SEP> I love it!
this album has alote swing <SEP> great album from Luisito carrion I will recommended to anyone who really like salsa you would liked this cd ..
Five Stars <SEP> Some rarities here.
Wrong version <SEP> It was the wrong version. It was from a concert and it has loud backround sounds Can't hear much of the song
"Down Melancholy Lane to that somber room down low... <SEP> I find that I listen to this album over and over. The songs seem to flow and if you listen to
the lyrics then you will enjoy the ride. Somber in mood, excellent guitar playing, and just Mark
singing several emotionally depressive songs, in excellent voice, that many of us find uplifting!

I have always been a fan of AMC, and then Mark when he went solo, and this does not disappoint...

An excellent record!"
"Schizophrenic! Big time <SEP> I don't have a whole lot of the Tokens in my library. The two discs that I own are the RCA 1994 compilation ""THE BEST OF"" and the Varese Sarabande 2004 compilation ""THE VERY BEST OF 1964-1967"". I must say I am quite fond of this folk group.

As this CD includes the ablum ""It's a happening world"" and 11 bonus tracks, it's a very generous offering. But to listen to the whole CD from the beginning to the end is a rather excruciating and schizophrenic experience. One minute it's folk, next minute it's sunshine/Baroque pop or surf rock. Similarly, the vocal harmony often switches from four-part folk-rock to multi-layer Beach Boy and/or the late Beatles without any warning. Track 17 ""Animal"" is a great example of what goes wrong: the group is trying so very hard to sound ""hip"", it ends up sounding like a caricature of themselves."
Two Stars <SEP> Not my type of music
Good <SEP> My favorite game. Songs are excellent
"Guitar sounds so intensely and artfully textured you can almost smell and taste them <SEP> If you love delicious electric guitar sounds with outstanding use of complex timbre ... I've always been in heaven whenever I've heard Ava Mendoza play, though."
"What the hell happened. <SEP> On Your Side was the perfect mix between Rock/Punk/Pop/Acoustic. This is just, a horrible, horrible country music album. My ears. Oh God, my ears."
Lauren Desburg <SEP> Such a beautiful voice. A regular on my playlist.
"I bought that recording <SEP> Bach is very forgiving to transcribers. There are plenty of excellent arrangements for solo trumpet of Bach compositions by Maurice Andre, Alison Balsom and others. They usually include arias from Cantatas or transcriptions of suites or sonatas for flute or strings. I was skeptical when I first saw this CD on Spotify and wondering what the Matthew Passion would sound like as a (mostly) trumpet and Organ piece.  I was even more skeptical in view of the numbers chosen here: arias, chorals and especially recitatives. This is a resounding success. Dorthe Zielke has a very rich sound both on the Flugel and the Bb. Her attacks and phrasing are stylistically coherent and in good taste, just a hint of vibrato in the arias.  I really like the way she leans into the notes. Her recitatives are nothing short of stunning. For instance, listen to #11 ""Und von der sechsten Stunde an;"" Recitatives are sometimes ungrateful to the voice, but in that instance she conveys the storm of emotions of the Evangelist and Jesus quite strongly."
Five Stars <SEP> SO good I bought it AGAIN..
Verbage <SEP> She said she did like the words the author used and stopped listening to it after 20 days.  Not for her
"Astonishing music <SEP> If you like Beth Orton, this is the album to have.  The songs are astonishingly beautiful.  I saw her in concert not long after the CD came out and that added to my enjoyment of the music itself, but even without the personal experience it would still be a superior CD."
Five Stars <SEP> really fun and better than Britney version!
"Beto Iglesias? <SEP> Not that the songs are that bad, it just doesn't sound like La Ley or even like the Beto Cuevas anymore.  Hip/hop & Rap Producer Jared Lee Gosselin is an unfortunate choice.  He turned Beto's songs into mainstream radio club songs - a lot of competition in this market.  Beto is sure to pass unnoticed amidst hundreds of artists all trying to sound the same. Bad news for Beto is that he is not Enrique, and he is not JLo so he is unlikely to seize the US market singing this style of music in spanish.  As for Latin America and Spain, I doubt Beto will make any impact with this record.  Beto is a rock singer.  I am a long time fan of Beto and it is disappointing to see him copy other artists. I think he should stay true to his roots. ""Me too"" strategies do not work so well."
Five Stars <SEP> I collect songs for Karaoke
"Fever Ray joins Royksopp for another great tune <SEP> Royksopp and Fever Ray are an awesome combination of talents. Their collaboration have produced two of my all time favorite songs.
This one is quickly becoming a favorite too!"
Cute children's song. <SEP> I used this with my PK4 class at the Christmas program.  They loved singing it all dressed up like Christmas trees.
THE RAP RUINS THE SONG <SEP> RAP DOESN'T BELONG ON A KYLIE A SONG!!! Buy the original WITHOUT the TALENTLESS Mims!!! PURE GARBAGE
"I listen to this great song over and over <SEP> I listen to this great song over and over.  Lee Marvin stars in ""Paint Your Covered Wagon"" a movie from 1971.  I printed out the lyrics and sing along with this great song!"
One Star <SEP> Not what I was 'll looking for
"Couldn't Downloaod it to iTunes <SEP> No matter what I did, I couldn't download this song to my computer or iTunes...It just stay on Cloud. Gave up, and bought it on iTunes...would like my $1.00 back Amazon....

If there was a no stars option or better yet a minus stars option, I would have chosen that, and I have been a very customer over the years..."
"Very nice song. <SEP> Awesome. Enjoyed every bit. I liked the crystals version, but then realized Beach Boys did a reverse of the same. Good one."
"Another classic release on stereo for the first time. <SEP> You get both the mono an stereo versions of this classic ablum, and once again you have the insanely good 'california girls' on this one.  help me rhonda"" also is on this one.  Another huge hitt. The sound is remastered and it's a good addition to anyone who wants some fun rock music from that era , this music is so good it will make you happy."
"My regrettable and no less impulsive purchase leaves me flat <SEP> I'm not certain why I bought this CD. After a couple of listens, it has left me bereft of feeling or courage to spin it one more time."
"Five Stars <SEP> My favorite BB song, listen to it."
"A Stereo Remaster??  I think not. <SEP> After listening to so many of the wonderful new stereo remasters of classic Beach Boys recordings, I was extremely surprised upon hearing this. ...and severely disappointed.

If you're expecting a revelation like you did when you first heard the original ""Good Vibrations"" in stereo, this ""stereo"" version of ""Help Me, Rhonda"" was hardly such an endeavor.  For this, the 45rpm version of ""Help Me, Rhonda,"" the ""stereo"" is merely the usual monaural single, panned a little to the left, with poor noise reduction and an irksome echo effect on the right. Hardly the stereo I was expecting.

Save your money, folks.  The best master of the ""Help Me, Rhonda"" hit single is still best when played in mono, preferably from the newly remastered ""Fifty Big Ones - Greatest Hits"" compliation.  The elusive true stereo recording of the ""Help Me, Rhonda"" hit has yet to be created."
Five Stars <SEP> Not a bad little song.
"I absolutely love this album <SEP> I absolutely love this album! All but 2 of these songs are very familiar to me, so it brought back some good memories! Thankful to see young people serving the Lord!!"
"God's Been Good <SEP> I only recently heard of this song - I listened to a couple different artist singing it and this is the one I picked.
Thank you!"
Great! <SEP> I've had this album on vinyl for over 40 years. Now I'm able to listen to this masterpiece on mp3 whenever I want!
One Star <SEP> did not like his voice
Saw him with his mother.  He sang this with her. <SEP> Loved his interpretation  of How Deep Is The Ocean.  He sang this with his mother on a Public Television Broadcast.
Problem is that it did not download to my I pad. <SEP> I did not receive this download so have not heard it.  I am afraid I have been charged for it.  Please advise. Thank you
Thought he might be talented but... <SEP> It stopped at his marvelous mom. Jason just doesn't do it in my opinion. Columbus stood on a burning deck....
Dropplets is Awesome <SEP> I found Dropplets in the music section of Amazon...It was a perfect musical background for a slide show presentation I had to give to a large group of Nature Folks...I certainly would recommend this music to any nature photographer building slide shows + the price was right.
Ayn Rand Anthem- 2 Disc Complete Audio CD Box Set Including Her Quotes... Ayn Rand ..LOVED IT <SEP> This was best decision I made to purchase this CD set . Not only am I able to listen while I ride into work but I'm able to get so much more done. It's truly been a blessing . I recommend this one to anyone who needs help focusing and relaxing .My CD's arrived promptly and I was not disappointed . Package was clean and odorless and sealed very professionally. I couldn't have been more pleased. Buyers be confident this seller is on top of there game. Thanks Again
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent version
Wonderful song <SEP> I really love this song.  very catchy and easy to learn.  It sticks in my head and I sing it all the time
"Old standard provides above standard quality <SEP> Wanda continues to amaze with her spot on quality! Maturity doesn't have limits, Ms. Jackson's effort is stellar as always!"
Two Stars <SEP> way cheesy - usually like Mandisa's songs

"Great Christian/country music <SEP> Bought this CD on a trip and listened to it several times on the way home. I like his traditional songs and it was great hearing some new ones too. My favorite was ""Circle of Friends"" and we used this as a theme song to a video about Cowboy Church we were making. It perfectly fit the situation. Wish he would make more just like this!"
Five Stars <SEP> Good song
I really like this one <SEP> This starts out with plain piano and builds with acoustical guitar. This is a very contemporary instrumental interpretation of a traditional carol. I really like this one.
"not her best <SEP> eh, not her best song"
a beautiful Christmas song <SEP> This is a wonderful Christmas song.  I enjoy listening to it over and over.  The words are beautiful and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
"I Feel So Broke Up, I Want To Go Home <SEP> I used to have this on CD and caught myself singing it one day. I realized it wasn't in my digital music library, so I had to have it. Love this one."
Hidden Gem <SEP> This EP is truly a hidden gem.  I had no idea it was released by Jonas until a few years later and fell in love with it on the first listen.  It definitely has some of his best work and I wish it was a full 10 track album - he had something magical going on with these sessions.  Highly recommended and a must-have for any Jonas Munk / Manual fan.
One Star <SEP> Downloads ask for last disk.  Unworkable.
One Star <SEP> ok
One Star <SEP> there is no song there
One Star <SEP> couldn't purchase the song on CD
"VERY DISAPPOINTED! <SEP> First of all let me say I love the Newsboys.  With that said...
I was very disappointed with this version of this wonderful old-time gospel song!  The first 25 seconds of the 30 second sample was nothing but what sounded like the band warming up and the collective murmur of the audience.  Only then do you hear 5 seconds of singing. I purchased this song anyway because, like I said, I love the Newsboys.  Well...this version started out with a very SLOW first verse, then a very slow SAME FIRST VERSE sung by the audience. Then...the Newsboys, once again, sang the first verse again (same SLOW SPEED), and ended with repeating the last half of the first verse!  There are 4-5 full verses to this beautiful song. The Newsboys could have easily hit the song out of the park! But instead this version was NOT even worth the $1.29. I immediatly deleted it and went with another version whose name I didn't recognize, because he samg the ENTIRE SONG, not just the first verse!"
Two Stars <SEP> lame
Best chiptunes album I've ever heard <SEP> I listen to this album at LEAST once per day...that is how good it is. Hands down the best chiptunes songs I've found yet. Can't wait for more future albums...hope they follow this path!
Two Stars <SEP> Christmas music is not her strong suite.
Beautiful! <SEP> Wonderful song and vocals!  Highly recommended!
good quality <SEP> I loved it.  I sounded just like the clip I played and had no problem downloading it to my computer at all.
"my favorite American Idol <SEP> Keeps getting better and better with each new record. This was a little surprising to be released as a single, but it's a fun song for any true Kelly Clarkson fan."
Cut short? <SEP> The song seemed to have cut out rather abruptly at the end. I don't remember the original recording doing that.
Another great tune by Kelly! <SEP> Another great catchy tune by Kelly Clarkson! Wish that this one was included on her new 'Best of' album that included several new hits.
love <SEP> amazing and perfect for modern or contemporary dance
Four Stars <SEP> Like it.
"DO NO BUY <SEP> For some reason, will not download to computer, not sure why.  I have been purchasing songs for years from Amazon, now I am having issues..."
"My kind of rap! <SEP> I cant stand the auto tune that many artists and ""rappers"" (ie Drake, Lil Wayne, T-Pain) use on their tracks these days... It completely ruins otherwise decent songs.  Auto-tune is NOT what you will find on this RIP album!  Rip is raw, honest talent!

My favorite songs on this album, ""Sellout,"" are ""Hate That I Love You"" (definitely not to be confused with the Rihanna song by the same name, although I like that song too) ""Kissin' In the Dark"" (a remix of an old country song by Alabama.  I heard the intro on the radio the other day, thought it was this song, and was mildly disappointed when I realized it was the original!  Again, though, I like both versions) and ""#lml"" (GREAT song to dance to!!!)

While I have heard these three songs before the album was released, they all made me want to buy the album.  And this album made me want to buy RIP's first album ""Fashionably Late"""
"Reply <SEP> I think your instructions for the downloading procedure are even more confusing than before.  It took me forever to find my song but I finally did.  Surely there has to be a simpler way to do this than the one supplied.  You might consider using a numbered step procedure.

~Bill Massey"
One Star <SEP> I was unable to download the song to my computer.
GTA4!! <SEP> awesome song
"I love the song <SEP> This is clearly a bootlegged version.  I love the song, but this is a very rare occasion where I can tell that this is not a studio-sanctioned copy."
"All Hooked Up To The Blues! <SEP> Multiple Grammy and Blues Music Award nominee John Lee Hooker Jr delivers his own brand of funked up jazz and soul with his roots firmly in the blues!  His latest album `All Hooked Up' produced by Larry Batiste (who also co-writes some of the tracks) features Michael Rogers on drums, Frank 'Tebo' Thibeaux on bass, Will 'Roc' Griffin on keyboards, John Garcia & Jeffrey Horan on guitars, as well as fine contributions from an incredible array of session musicians who help make this CD so memorable.  Following in the footsteps of his father and original blues legend 'Johnny Lee' was never going to be easy and after going off the rails early in life, John Lee Hooker Jr found religion successfully turning his life around, channeling himself into his music feeling ""all hooked up"" with God which actually helped inspire the funky title track of this, his fifth album.

`All Hooked Up' highlights include guest performances by Lucky Peterson taking lead guitar on a tribute to the U.S. military entitled 'You Be My Hero' and Betty Wright forming a duet for 'I Surrender' which typifies that golden sound heard on 70's Northern Soul dance floors.  Another outstanding track to savour here is the 'Claptonesque' 'Tell It Like It Is' echoing the catchy 'Crossroads' tune complete with guitar solo.  Should you need one good reason to buy this album, then look no further than the soulful voice of John Lee Hooker Jr delivering autobiographical lines like ""My life is going down like quicksand, and my daddy is dead and gone"" on the track 'Hard Times', which also brings the sublime blues guitar of John Garcia to the fore creating an unforgettable slow burning blues classic that makes essential listening!"
"I just don't feel it at all.. <SEP> Too early and to much more work needed to start selling your stuff mate. Get a new vocalist and recording studio, than try again."
Five Stars <SEP> It is great!!
But this one turned out to be very annoying. There is some kind of plinking sound like ... <SEP> Had high hopes for this recording.  We go to sleep with a rain cd.  But this one turned out to be very annoying.  There is some kind of plinking sound like heavy rain hitting a tin roof.  It is a hard beating that tended to wake me up instead of ushering me into la la land.  This is not good for use in motivation to relaxation.
Addicted to this song <SEP> I'm addicted to this song. Lead vocals are ethereal & the beats & breaks leave you hanging from a cliff with your mouth open throughout its entirely. It should come with a warning label. Love it.
"Still With Me MP3 Download <SEP> I give the song 5 Stars from listening to it on my radio. I give Amazon's download process 0 stars. I have Windows XP on my computer with a FAT-32 file system. I tried to download the Amazon MP3 downloader but when I open it up after the download I get an error. So, I tried to download the song directly to my computer it stops as soon as it starts. Windows cannot open the file.

I do not care about the Amazon Cloud Player. I do not care about about the Amazon MP3 Downloader. All I want to do is download a song in the regular way in the MP3 format directly to my computer.

If I cannot do it this way at Amazon, I will download my songs elsewhere."
Good Track <SEP> Another good track. All I can say is that I love this album.
"absolutely SUCKS, just plain unlistenable <SEP> absolutely SUCKS, just plain unlistenable......some artists worse than others, but not one on there who is capable of performing Petty.....Sorry.....just the truth.  There's not a TP&THB fan out there who would give this a second listen.  Why would they bother?"
Four Stars <SEP> An encouraging song and well performed.
"Of course the BEST track (Latin Rascals' ""Lisa's Coming"" 80s electro nugget) is ... <SEP> Of course the BEST track (Latin Rascals' ""Lisa's Coming"" 80s electro nugget) is of course ""Album Only"" track, so you can't buy it separately, so you're forced to buy the entire soundtrack. That's why it's called moving units."
Not all the songs are on there. <SEP> Missing a lot of the high-profile good songs like the one they sing in the car. Not what I expected.
"do not purchase <SEP> It is strictly instrumental; not actual songs you hear in the movie, but rather the music in the background of certain scenes. I was disappointed."
"Nothing Special <SEP> Eh, I really wanted to like this band, but the few songs I bought have been very run of the mill. The vocalist has limited ability and the subject matter has been done many times before. I'd rather stick to Booze and Glory or Niblick Henbane."
Five Stars <SEP> My new favorite band.
"What do they mean by essential? <SEP> The Essential Disney Collection would mean, in my vocabulary, the original performers in the original recordings--and this is certainly not it.  We have a bunch of voices we have never heard before.  Julie Andrews they ain't.
This was a waste of money."
"I don't know what it is <SEP> I think these mega compliations, it is just something subtle about the versions they get... it is the same song, but without the soul.  That being said, I didn't listen to the full albumn so perhaps I am a bit premature.  The few versions I did listen to though, they fell short."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
Love it <SEP> Great song
Completely useless! <SEP> Couldn't download to my phone and couldn't get a refund. Completely useless!
Cool Remix <SEP> I lurve it! It has a nice gay club vibe to it.
Four Stars <SEP> very nice music
"Progressive politics <SEP> If you were seeking beautiful folk music as Annabelle has created previously, you have come to the wrong place for your pleasant, relaxing experience. This is a political rant set to music. That wonderful voice and mandolin are wasted on this nonsense. And her political views expressed here lead to tyranny to top it off. Two stars, but only due to the force of the talent. I guess that talent and wisdom do not correlate well sometimes."
"STOP...don't purchase <SEP> Wrong song. Page says ""New To Me"" but the track is ""New Beginning"""
If you like normal audible books you won't like this <SEP> This is not really Jim Rohn. It is him speaking with music and edits. If you like normal audible books you won't like this.
"Four Stars <SEP> Beautiful, relaxing, contemplative guitar. Like laying in a sunbeam"
"Best Showbread Album to Date <SEP> What is so great about this album? The lyrics are exceptional, the music is a perfect cross between Showbread's ""No Sir, Nihilism is Not Practical"" and ""Age of Reptiles"" albums and none of the songs lack definition and all sound great.
What is bad about this album? Nothing!"
"Funeral Music of my Choice <SEP> Fairvale Funeral Parlor is perfect for a funeral! I am not waiting for my own demise,however;the music is much too good for that. This music is beautiful in a dark and gloomy way,filling this listener with a sweet melancholy..."
"It is what it is <SEP> I can't say much about this,  I bought it for a soundtrack of a Halloween video at work.  Not my kind of music but the kids like it a lot.  Kids today...."
"Simply amazing!! <SEP> Listening to Sarabeth put so much of her heart and soul into the songs just amazes me for someone as young as she is.  I'm looking forward to much, much more from her.  Kicking and Screaming is awesome and my teen-age granddaughter loves it!!  Can hardly wait to have it in my vehicle so we can listen and sing along as we drive...it's ""our"" time together.  Keep singing Sarabeth"
One Star <SEP> I have no Idea wish there was a script
Another great cover of a great song <SEP> This is another great cover song by Alex Boye. The beat-boxing adds a bit of a tweak to this MJ classic.
One Star <SEP> Awful voice
Excellent Folk Rock <SEP> Along the lines of Need to Breath with a little more southern rock feel to it.  I heartily recommend this song.
Not Charles Tenant <SEP> Bought this version by mistake and had to come back and buy La Mer by Charles Tenant who wrote and performs the version that is best known. This version is poorly recorded and not good at all!
One Star <SEP> I have no Idea
"Can't stand this version of the great song ""Deep Waters"" <SEP> I'm so very dissapointed because this is not the version I love...I wished I had known before I purchased it...I absolutely hate it...can't sing along - too slow; If I had known about this version and wanted it, it would be ok! I hate and would love to exchange it for the radio version."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
"New England Doom and Gloom Featuring Art by Kelley Hagemes! <SEP> I'm writing this to share the link for the wonderful artist who did the cover art for the e.p. you see pictured above. Her name is Kelley Hagemes and she can be found at: www(dot)kelleyhagemes(dot)com.

Kelley was gracious enough to create this specifically for our album and we're honored to have her on board for our follow up e.p. releasing early 2013!"
"Modern Flamenco without the clutter <SEP> OVERVIEW

Paco Serrano has been one of my favourite guitarists since I first heard him, when he was a teenager.

Although he has several albums under his belt as an accompanist, his only previous solo outing (apart from the video for Encuentro Productions) has been 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mi-camino/dp/B00003GAEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mi camino</a>; so this new one gets an especial welcome from me.

As compared with the previous offering, the passage of time is evident in the considerably-extended harmonic and rhythmic vocabularies. The absence of extraneous unflamenco clutter, though (such as violins, flutes, trumpets etc.), remains the same &mdash; I'm happy to say.

Rhythmic support takes the customary form of palmas, jaleo, percussion, and some dancing. A touch of cante is heard from Cristina Pareja, and there's also a credit to the Escolana del Conservatorio Profesional ""Msico Ziryab"" (which my dictionary tells me is a boys' choir).

THE MUSIC

The stereo image is good, and doesn't suffer from the excessive reverb that often afflicts Spanish recordings.

Somewhat to my surprise, there appears to be little or no double-tracking; or if there is, it's very subtle. Additional texture is provided by the rhythm section.

The choir seems to be featured only on the rumba, on which it's quite effective. Ms. Pareja is heard on the alegras, displaying a lovely, very flamenco voice. I did fancy I heard an ud in the bulera, playing octaves with the guitar; but in fact it's Paco's guitar, with a sponge-rubber mute under the strings.

A couple of pieces (e.g. the fandango and tanguillo) are quite unusual, and take a moment to place the style.  The minera starts libre and finishes a comps.

One of the criteria I judge by is that the pieces should seem conceived as a whole, rather than as a collection of falsetas strung together (even if the latter is actually the case); and all those here pass with ease. The whole album has a rather wistful feel that I find very appealing.

SUMMARY

In my opinion this is an album to be proud of.

The total time is 46'48""."
"Butter <SEP> Mateo Messina's Butter was a difficult score to review. Messina's best-known work, his composition for the score of the immensely successful Juno, is renowned as creative, prolific, and remarkably representative of the film's content considering its unique motifs. With Butter, Messina again presents a listening experience in stark contrast to most modern and traditional film scores, but while successful in that regard, Butter will challenge film score listeners with frustrating elements in parallel.

Butter's first track sets the stage for the score's energetic, Motown-inspired contents, and right from the start and regardless of one's exposure to the film, will get your foot tapping and prompt a casual smile. Though the leadoff song is the only one that contains vocals, the primary remainder of the score retains the Motown and moonlighting musical elements of alternating drum percussion and clapping, organ- and piano-driven tunes, and careless fun, all of which easily lend themselves to feelings of childlike nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek humor (furthered by the songs' titles). Unfortunately, the prevalence of this overall sound with little variability is one of the score's weaknesses, except on ""Smokin'"" when electric guitar riffs are incorporated or on ""Knife Sisters"" when electronic elements are introduced. On later tracks such as the effective ""867 Sticks of Butter,"" Messina gets a little more soulful and emotive and temporarily ceases the percussion, but too soon later the foundational musical elements return, almost totally abolishing any lasting impression upon the listener.

And ""too soon"" is Butter's Achilles' heel indeed; with the score totaling forty-five tracks and duration of forty minutes, even a listener with an incredibly short attention span will quickly grow frustrated by how often the music starts anew and slightly changes direction. At seemingly the exact point when one becomes aurally invested, the cycle begins again with another track, and I can't help but think that if they were longer, or joined with organ-driven monochromatic leads at the very least, Butter's songs would illustrate a much more effective stylistic energy. While I have no doubt that the music is more fitting and rewarding in the film, the structure doesn't truly lend itself to a standalone score release. Consequently, Mateo Messina's Butter has an interesting style, but lacks cohesion; it illustrates thoughtfulness, but not continuance; it exudes life, but doesn't incite passion. Finally, and most importantly, while Butter has energy, it doesn't have electricity, and for that reason, is solely recommended to fans of the Butter film itself, than to that of film score listeners and collectors."
"great sound quality <SEP> First off, I love all Beach Boy music. This downloaded song (She knows me too well stereo) sounds really incredible when I play it thru my I Tunes.  Clear, crisp and sounding like it was recorded recently because it is technologically perfect. It is, however, the original song as I remember it from the 60's radio."
"Beautiful song <SEP> Heard this on It's Okay, That's Love and immediately went to buy it. Amazing song, so pleased with this serendipitous find. You can tap your toe to it, relax and chill out with it, or get up and dance. Plus the lyrics are very lovely and sweet. I love the combo of electronic sounds and traditional instruments as well. I imagine a DJ could blend this track into a mix of many other songs and it would fit right in no matter what."
Great Music <SEP> This music is great for sporting event videos and for working out at the gym. I would recommed it to a friend.
The worst <SEP> This is not the original. It is horrible. They re did the vocal and they are not even dubbed in the right way(they are really low).
This is what real music sounds like. Kutt delivers a pulse-pounding hood scholar epilogue that ... <SEP> This is what real music sounds like.  Kutt delivers a pulse-pounding hood scholar epilogue that anyone can sway too!
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent master piece !
Two Stars <SEP> it ok not what I expected
I love all of Heintje Simons recordings. <SEP> I love the songs of Heintje Simons. He was brilliant as an alto boy singer before his voice changed. His songs are still worth enjoying many decades later. I give my full endorsement for this song album. Loosely translated as Heart melodies.
Tchaikovsky <SEP> Tchaikovsky - Masterpiece Collection- wonderful gift to me from my friends. He is my beloved composer. I love all his music.
"Good upcoming artist <SEP> This album is the second release by Tiffany Alvord, a promising YouTube artist. Her songs are catchy and relatable for teens."
Love It <SEP> Beautiful!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Very happy great service
Great!! <SEP> This is a great CD! I enjoy listening to it at all times during the day and it doesn't get old! Buy it!
Fantastic album <SEP> Fantastic first album from Jeff (I say first in hope that there is a second). His original songs and amazing piano skills are definitely worth the download.
Bliss <SEP> Beautiful journey. Thoughtfully arranged beats with smooth vocals by various artists.  I hope to hear more from this new artist.
Love it! <SEP> So romantic.
Five Stars <SEP> love it
Not good to use for sleeping children <SEP> I did not realize it was only 30 seconds and wanted to play it on repeat for a sleeping toddler.  Having the sound cut off with no fade out and restart every 30 seconds does not make this sound a good option for overnight sleeping or for naps.  My toddler would immediately twist his head each time it ended/started to see what it was.
"not what you hear on the radio <SEP> This is what came up when I searched for ""That's What Makes You Beautiful"".  It's not at all the original version, but sounds like someone playing pots and pans.  I couldn't tell from the tiny sample I heard that it was the wrong version.  Unfortunately, I can't return it!  Waste of money."
Trash. Why recording companies are allowed to record and ... <SEP> Trash. Why recording companies are allowed to record and sell this filth is beyond me. DO NOT LET ANYONE - INCLUDING FAMILY - HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR PASSWORDS.
Poetic <SEP> One of the best poets with his newest band! Awesome lyrics wrapped up in intense music experience.
"The return of Blake S. <SEP> The first full length album of Blake Schwartzenbach material in 10 years is a disappointment.  I hadn't kept up with Blake as he moved from J2B to Thorns of Life to forgetters, but his songwriting chops have clearly waned in that period.  It's telling that two of the best songs here -- ""O Deadly Death"" and ""Ribbonhead"" -- were written years ago while he was still in Thorns of Life.  Of course, this fits the larger trend -- after peaking with Dear You and Orange Rhyming Dictionary, Blake's music (as opposed to his lyrics) dipped each time with Four Cornered Night and Perfecting Loneliness.  It's a rare feat for a songwriter to continue to write engaging music into middle age -- most run out of interesting melodic ideas after awhile -- but I was hoping Blake would be an exception to the rule."
"In America <SEP> To call this album ""good"", would fall far short of it's potential greatness. As with most Blake Schwarzenbach albums, it's the discovery and purpose of each song, by the listener, that peels back the true nature and beauty of this album. If one spends the time to listen, you will find an album about a fractured relationship.  A crumbling relationship of time, country and place, that one cannot escape.
It's good."
Pretty good. <SEP> It is a really good song my kids love it and now they must have it play all night to sleep by.
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite singers!
Music in my ears <SEP> Fast add love the artist
"Feeling Sexy <SEP> I've been meaning to download this song for at least a year, but kept forgetting.  Miguel has such a sexy style and voice and this song makes me feel sexy; regardless of the message."
"Great <SEP> The Boss music at the end is a little different and runs a little bit long/ repetitive. Otherwise, it's great :)"
"Candles in the Sun, is too deep for the weak... <SEP> I love all of Miguel's music but this song is so deep, some people can't handle it because they can't handle the truth.  A beautiful and painful truth about ""What are we doing now?"""
Music <SEP> Just don't like the song.  I thoght it could have been better. It was not the song I was looking for.
Five Stars <SEP> cant stop playing it
review <SEP> It is really catchy and I like it a lot. You guys should totally listen to Cher Lloyd. So yea
"great song <SEP> song was great for my play and super duper fast, it comes to your account as soon as you purchased it."
"I hate this song... <SEP> It said that I bought this song but I don't remember doing it, but if I did I don't know what came over me. My friend tried to get me to listen to this and I flat out said no, so I really don't know how it ended up on my kindle..."
Friend song <SEP> This fits my friend and I to a tee. Love the song. Very upbeat and a crowd pleaser. I have a few of her songs.
Drumming Circles <SEP> Used this special selection to put together a program of drumming for me and my novice fellow-drummers.  I found it so helpful!
One Star <SEP> DID NOT RECEIVE THIS.
Ok song <SEP> Not what i thought it would Sound like.
"Better than David Hasselhoff <SEP> This is a corny and washed-out version that has no soul. Better than David Hasselhoff, but by no means captures the depth and feeling the original cast conveys."
Five Stars <SEP> Exactly ad described. Well packaged for safe delivery.  Thanks!!!
"Can we mute the vocals? Please! <SEP> I would prefer an instrumental version of this album. Jekyll & Hyde is my favorite musical and I am very open and excited about new and fresh looks at the work. The vocal performance of Constantine Maroulis and Deborah Cox are hard to understand. The vocal demands of the roles they perform are way beyond their capabilities. Deborah's vocals sound strained and unsupported. Constantine's Jekyll goes in and out of an accent through the album and leaves me rolling my eyes. too often the performers forget that they are telling a story as they try to fit as many vocal riffs, screeches, and screams into the score. The addition of auto tuning to Maroulis' Hyde only confirms that he was a pour choice for this project.

I applaud the sound technicians and the new arrangements of the Wildhorn score. Sadly I fear that this album is a waste of time. If you want a fresh rock and roll take on this musical with dynamic vocal performances than I suggest ""Jekyll & Hyde resurrection"" starring Rob Evans."
"Very nice, but I have to admit that I much ... <SEP> Very nice, but I have to admit that I much prefer Jekyll & Hyde: The Complete Work - The Gothic Musical Thriller. Still, I'll leave this in the rotation."
"I so wanted this to be good <SEP> It's just not good. They updated the music so it's like synthy, and that's fine. But man, whoever hired this cast... there was no depth to Maroulis's voice. I'm listening to this, hoping it was will be even close to what it should be, and it's not. The two females singers were decent I guess. The weird sing-songy rendition of 'Bring in the Men' was the most disappointing. That, and the renditions of 'Alive' and 'Confrontation.' Maroulis just isn't a strong enough singer. I'm mostly just glad that ears don't bleed when high-pitched notes are done poorly, or else I'd need a shower. I don't usually leave reviews on things, but I hold Jekyll & Hyde close to my heart, and the 1994 version is probably the best one out there. I just had to say something. Just ugh."
Script has been written well. <SEP> I am in awe how the script has been written very well and it affects so much.
The background music is beautiful but very difficult to follow with a unskilled singer <SEP> The background music is beautiful but very difficult to follow with a unskilled singer. A simpler version would be much easier to master.
"I was very disappointed with this version of Distant Lover <SEP> I was very disappointed with this version of Distant Lover. If I would have had previous knowledge that it was edited so poorly, I would not have purchased this version. In the future only sell the original extended version. You got to remember, this is Marvin Gaye not some never was. Give your customers his best!!!!"
"Nothing in the title or description mentioned this is a ... <SEP> Nothing in the title or description mentioned this is a short version.
This is the reason people steal music."
"Great record - terrible sound <SEP> I don't know what went wrong when they were mastering this, but it sounds terrible. It sounds over-amped and distorted."
"poor <SEP> not original artist, poor quality"
Good music not what I had hoped for. <SEP> This is a poor remake of this song. I was hoping for a better version of the song. The music was well done but it was not a good arrangement.
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful song
Very enjoyable. <SEP> Loved this song from The Piano Guys. The video was also entertaining as well.
Really do hate this song <SEP> Really do hate this song.  This rendition is tolerable (better without vocals than with that vocalized wailing of Ti tayyy  neei  um
"Alex Boye, enough said <SEP> Got this one mixed up with the other one that is on the CD.  I love the piano guys and Alex Boye and hope to hear more."
Five Stars <SEP> Brilliant music
"They loved it! <SEP> Very inspirational--I set highlights of my son's basketball team to this (and ""In the Zone"" and ""Gonna Fly Now"" to motivate them for future games.  They loved it!"
Four Stars <SEP> Good
Wasted $$$$ <SEP> I wish the EXLPLICIT was spelled out clearer. I can't play this for kids.  UGH. Wasted $$$$
like <SEP> I really like the Bourne Identity movies and love how the music is blended.
"You can't beat The Piano Guys <SEP> Great music, terrific style - it is a good album, as expected from these talented guys. I'd buy it again."
"good song. i like this song which is why i bought it as an mp3. i like this song, is this review over? <SEP> good song. i like this song which is why i bought it as an mp3. i like this song, is this review over?"
"""True experience of a Beatle show"" <SEP> This CD gives a very real experience of what a Beatles concert was like back then. It does not have the polished sound of the ""Hollywood Bowl"" show (which received much studio work to clean it up).  The vocals are often distorted, as I'm sure they had to turn things up as loud as they could to be heard. The playing and singing is not necessarily top-notch, as they often could not hear themselves, but I'll go back to my original point.  If you want to experience what I'm sure many shows were like, then this is a must-have CD. The banter between songs is funny, and the true hysteria of the crowd is evident. There is even one point when the announcer comes out during the show to try to calm people down (I'm sure it didn't really help). For the most part, the sound is good. It does sound like it came from the stage, not somewhere out in the audience. Authorized?  Probably not. Entertaining?  Yes!  Any Beatlemaniac should get this!"
Buyer beware. <SEP> Buyer beware. This is a bootleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.
Bootleg! <SEP> This 'alternate' Beatles CD is an unauthorized bootleg. It is a cheap CD-R. The sound quality and artwork are truly awful!
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! <SEP> This album sounds like it was recorded on a dictaphone from outside of the arena. Also most likely a bootleg. I would give it no stars if possible.
"So Pretty and Sad... <SEP> This was one of the first Piano Guys' songs I bought.  It is very gentle and patient and melodic.  The title always makes me think of the character Arwen, from Lord of the Rings, and this song fits her perfectly.
Another great song for fans of this one is ""A Thousand Years""."
One Star <SEP> There is only ONE 2:46 song on here!
"Awsome CD!!!!! <SEP> Nana Mizuki's ""Rockbound Neighbors"" album is totally awesome, a must have for any fan new or old. A great addition to any cd collection."
Four Stars <SEP> Good Holiday Tunes...
Worth it <SEP> Classic Stuff.  The songs and singer are timeless.  The CD quality is ok.  It's not a master quality re-release but then the price wasn't reflecting such.  Great quality for the price.
Five Stars <SEP> Have always loved this song.
Five Stars <SEP> love Christmas music!
Tough sledding for me <SEP> I can't remember how long it has been since I wanted to 'pass on' a CD.  With all the fine promise of this creative program I found the 'piano pounding' for emphasis to be simply annoying.  I tried over and over to adjust to the solo musicianship on several numbers.  Some very fine; some completely tiresome - to me at least (and I have a very broad range of tolerance for unusual and fine interpretations for all types of classical music).  I'm truly disappointed but appreciate the program; just not the execution.
My favorite Elvis Christmas song <SEP> Love this Elvis Christmas song. It's different and unique like Elvis himself. No one else could sing this song but Elvis.
Nothing Personal <SEP> Not a fan of Kidz Bop.  Had to get it for a kids Christmas sing a long at a nursing home.  It served its purpose but I am glad I don't have to hear it any more.
Five Stars <SEP> Elvis rocks
"love Willie but really wanted Elvis <SEP> Did not receive Elvis, got Willie Nelson instead.  No problem, love Willie but really wanted Elvis.  Will reorder another one soon."
"Doing sing-a-longs with the King does not a singer make <SEP> I love Elvis, but sneaking Martina McBride and Carrie Underwood into Blue Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas respectively is a dirty trick and completely unnecessary. It's probably why this album was so cheap. They completely ruined it. I'll Be Home For Christmas was the worst. I was sitting there minding my own business kind of taken aback by Blue Christmas, but Underwood was so nasal and kind of sounded like a giraffe in labor. Skip this and get a real Elvis Christmas album without these whiny country ""stars"" doing pitchy sing-alongs with the King."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
Great song <SEP> The Glee cast sometimes can improve on a song and this is one o them - I love the passion in her voice
Once Again! <SEP> Once again Glee has done a song better than the original. So much talent in such a tiny show. Fantastic!
"Not all bad, but not all great either <SEP> Apologies for this review coming in late, but I figure I'd put my 2 cents in. While a lot of bands change their sound or rearrange things around a bit, they usually do it and the album would sound awesome, untouchable. Unfortunately, the case isn't with this..I stopped listening halfway through the CD before it ended. While the production was pretty awesome, the drums were kinda disappointing. I didn't care too much for Pest's vocals in this one. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good album in its own right, but not good enough for me to play it over and over again like the previous releases. When it was first announced that this album was coming out, I was excited and couldn't wait. I mean, the bassist, Frank Watkins from Obituary is what sparked my interest, but I didn't hear too much of any bass in this CD. All in all, this CD didn't show any hunger, any anger, any energy. And as grim sounding as it was (grim is good) this CD failed to deliver anything else that was in any way like Gorgoroth in general. In my opinion, This CD gets only 2 stars, not a bad effort, but very bad in the delivery."
"This is supposed to be a return to their roots? <SEP> Because I don't hear anything that remotely resembles any of the material found on Antichrist or Pentagram. It starts off really lukewarm, then sort of picks up for about 5-20 seconds, and then just takes a nosedive into sheer mediocrity.

A trifle bit ironic that the song, *ahem*, ""Rebirth"" sounds more like a scrapped Xasthur track than anything Gorgoroth from 15 years ago would have composed; ""Rebirth"" into what? cashing in? For shame.

I've never really held the band in high regards to be totally honest, I'll enjoy listening to their first two full length albums now & again, but this album is going right into the recycling bin on my computer. There's nothing interesting happening here; there's no energy, there's no passion, it is a phoned in effort.

Oh well, 2009 hasn't been a COMPLETELY disappointing year for metal."
"Boring, Insulting to the Legacy <SEP> The album is just boring. It isn't horrid, it is listen-able, but I assure you when you get to the end you will not be able to tell one song from the other. If this was an album from a new black metal band, it would be acceptable. This however is not the case. The fact that this album is supposed to be the sort ""rebirth"" of the band since Infernus took the rights. Looking at it in this way is really quite sad. It lacks the passion, energy and anger that Gorgoroth became famous for.
So ultimately, yeah, go ahead and take a listen...but I am not sure you want to put your money towards something so mediocre."
"Hallelujah- Classis Song <SEP> This song was downloaded successfully. I really love the music and the lyrics of this song.
M. Sims"
Music ripoff <SEP> I was not aware that buying this song would not download to my device. I do not wish to install another app to be able to play. Very disappointed
Five Stars <SEP> Sons loves
"The Son of a Legend <SEP> Elmore pickedup right where his father left off as the genius who greated the electric slide guitar that came from Robert Johnson himself- Elmore continues in is great slide guitar sound which is quite missing in this blues age- A Great CD
Great price, service, sound,great transaction
Thank You
Billy Boy"
One Star <SEP> Wrong version
Hope <SEP> Love this song...it's amazing and when the kids sing pulls at our heart strings...everyone should hear this song if they know someone fighting cancer...
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"Not the original <SEP> I have this album on tape from 1989.  This song is particularly, and definitely different.  The female voices are not prominent. Only male voices are.
The original was more upbeat, and female voices were the only ones.
Original song was fun, upbeat, bumpin, and just plain old school Oaktown fun.
Have to shop elsewhere for this one...."
"I LIKE IT! <SEP> NICE SONG. REGINA BELLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS. HER MUSIC IS INSPIRATIONAL. WHAT COMES FROM THE HEART, REACHES THE HEART."
great prayer chants for the spirit <SEP> This CD has beautiful rhythm to the prayer chants and is great meditative sounds for the mind and spirit. Great for listeners that do meditation. It helps the individual to settle into the many folds that this CD provides and is calming to the soul.
"Amazing!! How sweet the sound!! <SEP> I have instantly become a huge fan of Steve Ryan. His music,His words, His voice,Amazing! I am looking forward in hearing more from this artist. Amazing!"
"One Star <SEP> Can't use it, so pointless"
"Exciting score, marred by poor quality control <SEP> HINDENBURG is an exciting score that will appeal to fans of BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT and the TRANSFORMERS scores. The Amazon MP3 presentation of this score, however, was not a good listening experience for me. At the very end of track 18, 'Suite From Hindenburg', right around the 7:02 mark, the music is clipped off, followed by two seconds of silence. To the producers of this album, please use some quality control and listen to your product before you upload it for purchase. Hopefully this problem does not also exist on the CD release, which I will now have to spend additional money to purchase."
"Does it matter if the album arrived in good condition (it did) if the album isn't any good ... <SEP> Does it matter if the album arrived in good condition (it did) if the album isn't any good to start with? I bought this hoping for some kind of overlap in sound with the first Session In Paris album with Charlie Haden and Don Cherry, but alas, 'twas not to be. If you enjoyed the first one, be forewarned. I think Charlie and Don just always brought the magic to their projects, and everyone who played with them sounded even better by extension. I dig some of Masahiko's other stuff, but this isn't one I'll have on repeat."
"Soothing sounds for relaxation, meditation, or healing with alchemy crystal bowls <SEP> This is a very soothing, pleasant singing bowls music album. This recording includes alchemy crystal bowls, which provide unique vibrational energies since they combine multiple elements. This is excellent music for healing and meditation. I've played singing bowls for many years and find they are a great tool for helping the mind relax and for releasing stress. Having a CD of singing bowls music is great to help relax and drift into deep meditative states."
Five Stars <SEP> great
Two Stars <SEP> too expensive for 43 dollars I see her at Madison Square Garden.
"Good Music <SEP> like the some of the tracks on this album, those are the ones that made me buy it. check it out, certain there's a track that appeals to you."
Two Stars <SEP> not the best recording.  better versions available.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
Four Stars <SEP> A Dennis Brown classic .
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful CD. Received it quickly
"Short AND Sweet <SEP> Nersery Myths seems to have a demo tape feel to it. Which isn't a bad things, I only mean to say that it seemed to come out of no where and without any explanation or advertisement; Almost as if to say: ""We hear people like good music, here's some"" And that is exactly what they delivered. Nursery Myths is short for a Black and White Years album but outside that one fact, Nursery Myths is still a black and white years album, meaning its great. The whole Album has a great feel to it, and you can listen to the whole thing (What A Thought!) without skipping a track.

Great Sound, Great Originality, and more solid songs on this half-album than a full album from most mainstream music.
Leaves you wanting more but that's not really a terrible thing. 5/5"
"LOVE THIS KIDS VOICE <SEP> I have LOVED James' voice ever since he auditioned for American Idol, and was so happy he made it as far as he did.  I have his full CD, Memories of a Beautiful Disaster he made and LOVE it as well, so these songs for this current CD even though there were only 5 it was a plus for me. And getting it on Amazon was even better as I couldn't find it when I was looking for it.  James has alot of individual sounds and songs that makes his voice enjoyable.  He's a Crazy Talented kid and I hope he goes far and wide..."
too much money for CD content <SEP> The CD only has five songs on it. I am very pleased with the artist and the songs but for 14 bucks they could have put on more thasn 5 songs. He definately sang more than that on the AI show. Too much money for too little music from the great JD.
One Star <SEP> great
"THIS IS A FAKE <SEP> DONT BUY! THis IS NOT THE REAL ALBUM!!!

THE ACTUAL ALBUM IS IS - NEED YOU NOW not  NEED YOU NOW NO ONE

THIS IS AN IMPOSER!!"
"Great Band <SEP> I these guys a lot, the singer has a great voice. I have been listening to it at least once a day."
Better than the original <SEP> I loved this acoustic version.  In it you can feel the pain the character is going through and the power of his voice.
Five Stars <SEP> good music
Merry Christmas <SEP> My wife's favorite christmas song.
Five Stars <SEP> Great Christmas arrangement!
"Jacki Evanco  ""My Heart Will Go On"" <SEP> I love listening to Jacki Evanco she is truly wonderful. All of my family like her and I have introduced opera to many of my neighbors, who had never listened to classical music before now."
"A lovely gal and song. <SEP> Ordered this for my Kindle, and listen to it frequently.  Recommend  anything this sweetheart my produce, record or offer for sale"
"Get this song! <SEP> Love this band. Amazing song. If you want some interesting,  out of the ordinary music, The Tiger Lillies are for you."
"inspirational beethoven <SEP> this is spectacular beethoven. none of your velvet slipper moonlight sonata or dinner jacket waldenstein, this is wonderfully youthful yet thoughtful, musical yet distinctively individual playing of these frequently recorded classical piano standards. inserting one or another disc to sample a specific movement or sonata, i found myself lured by the mastery and conviction of the performances into listening to the whole disc with great enjoyment. the phrase ""inspired performances"" is hackneyed, but here it is well deserved; inspirational beethoven might be more appropriate.

some reviewers have mentioned goodyear's tempi, and the liner notes commend his ""swift tempos, forward sweep, linear clarity"", but i think the point is overstated: with a few exceptions, his choices resemble those of kempff, schnabel or goode, and he communicates tenderness and mystery everywhere the music calls for it. he does have an aversion to shaping phrases with ritardando, which can be refreshing or disappointing depending on the context, but any ""linear clarity"" is balanced with a good ear for vertical balance. my main interpretive criticism is of goodyear's tendency to center a performance in the higher dynamic range and really crush the full handed fortes.

that quibble actually turns attention to the sound engineering. compiled across a two year interval by eight different producers, engineers and editors, the sound stage and presence of the instrument are uneven, and this is jarring when it comes between movements of a single work (for example in op. 101). apparently performed on one or two of the rental steinways at the glenn gould studio in toronto (pianos that would have been differently prepared and adjusted, back and forth, to suit other performers during the same period), some unevenness in tone would be inevitable. however the piano tone is sometimes unpleasantly hard and harsh, almost metallic in the bass and in forte passages.

these are symptoms if not concessions to the difficulty of publishing new classical recordings without the resources of a major label and their recording studios. they should not deter the ardent beethoven lover from experiencing these refreshing, virile and individualistic interpretations."
"PURCHASE OF STEWART GOODYEAR DVDs <SEP> Thank you for asking.  Meant to write immediately after I received the package, but I was preoccupied with other things at the time, and then the days passed and I thought I had lost my opportunity to report my disappointment with Amazon.

 I love the pianist, Stewart Goodyear, but I despised the CHEAP PACKAGING!  I expected each dvd to be in a plastic case, just as I had seen it at the Mondavi Concert Hall in Davis, CA.  Instead, the dvds I received stacked 1"" high, each in a paper jacket, with a $ 1.00-store  cheap case, and it so demeaned the exceptional pianist, and turned me off so badly that to date, I have listened to only ONE dvd because I am so disgusted and disappointed.  That packaging killed my enthusiasm right after the dvds arrived.  Prior to that, I was counting the days when they would arrive!!

AMAZON could redeem itself by changing the packaging, or at the very least, send me the plastic cases for them.  Other than that, I will not purchase another set for friends or relatives from Amazon, and I will tell my neighbor NOT to purchase a set from Amazon for her mother's Christmas present , unless she is not embarrassed by dime-store packaging.

Please let me hear from you.  It is very important because I am so hurt and disappointed presently.!

"Denny Freeman: an American guitar hero <SEP> Texas guitar legend Denny Freeman's instrumental tribute to his former road and studio pal is a knockout! And not unlike the Barry Goldberg instrumental tip of the hat to the Rolling Stones, ""Stoned Again,"" from a few years ago that Denny played on. (Denny as well as Mick Taylor and Ernie Watts.)

Classy, hip, straightforward, cool..."
Her voice is like an angel' <SEP> These beautiful songs of love become authentic when sung by lovely Jackie Evancho.  You can FEEL the love when you hear Jackie sing.
I have many of Kevin Kern's CDs. All superb ... <SEP> I have many of Kevin Kern's CDs. All superb to hear but this one does not seem to have that magic and brilliance of Kevin's other CDs.
"Good Christmas piano music <SEP> I was looking for something to play in my car that would work as ""background"" music.  I like all the pieces, but I found that when I listened to this CD over and over throughout the Christmas season they started to all sound quite similar.  I  would get it again and like it for what it is."
"REALLY? <SEP> THE REBECCA BLACK OF EDM. THIS IS A JOKE, DON'T KNOW WHY HE GOT NOMINATED . WHY COULDN'T PORTER ROBINSON OR DIPLO GET PICKED?"
"I'm glad I gave Al Walser a chance. <SEP> When I saw the Grammy nominees for Best Dance Recording, I was surprised to see an artist I hadn't heard of.
Alonside Avicii, Calvin Harris, Skrillex, and Swedish House Mafia was DJ Al Walser...

Had I been living under a rock to have not heard of this Grammy-nominated sensation?!

Well, long story short, ""I Can't Live Without You"" killed my dog and gave me AIDS. 0/10 Would not listen again."
"don't even ruin your ears by listening to the preview <SEP> I heard this guy was nominated for the Grammy's this year so i did some research on his song and came to this page from his youtube video. All i can say is HOW? WHAT? WHY? This is not a dance song it has me scratching my head more than anything. May i suggest looking up artists such at Hardwell, Wolfgang Gartner, Porter Robinson, Above & Beyond or better yet google Beatport top 100. ANY song on there will fuel your dance parties all night long"
"Awesome CD! <SEP> This is my favorite CD of Hunter Valentine's. I've been listening to it nonstop pretty much. All of the songs are great, I like every one of them! I recommend buying this CD to everyone. It's one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time!! Great music, great vocals, what more could you ask for?"
One Star <SEP> Why the heck did I buy this crap
"Great talent, soul-less performance. <SEP> She has an lovely, amazing voice and is a phenomenal talent, but is not yet mature enough to connect with the emotion behind a standard song and break down her operatic style to serve its true meaning or give it emotional contours. So while she's hitting notes, it's like she doesn't know what any of the words mean -- as if she spoke a different language and was singing this phonetically. Listen to Gene Wilder and you'll know right away what sets them apart."
Two Stars <SEP> Not very exciting...
Five Stars <SEP> Love the song and this young girl Jackie Evancho has the voice of an angel...need I say more...
"Beware it is a low quality counterfeit <SEP> I don't know how this obviously Pirate album got on Amazon, but there is no official release called ""Love""(?) from Dan Balan. In addition to this all MP3 songs are in really bad quality, you might not notice it over the headphones, but there is no bass at all when you put it on quality system with subs.
BTW: the official album from Dan Balan is just released on ITunes and called Freedom (with a same set of songs). You can look up it on Amazon (but it is currently not available).

Other then that songs are great (second star just for the content). Looking forward to get official (better sound quality album) from Amazon (can't get it from Apple's iTunes hype due ""religious"" believes :)"
"Only works with amazon music app.  App requires 7.0 <SEP> I have older iPad and don't have 7.0 which is required to use the amazon music program.  I can't get the music without the program.  As a result, I have no access to the music I purchased on the iPad I need it on.

Ive heard this album at my daughter's home.  It works great to put my grandson asleep.  Too bad he can't hear it when he stays with grandma."
"Apology on the previous apology <SEP> I wish to retract my apology, below, and renew my endorsement of the music of A Fine Frenzy (AFF).

I still do not like AFF's CD, ""Pines,"" which I acquired without hesitation based on the two previous efforts, ""One Cell in the Sea"" and ""Bomb in a Birdcage"" (No birds were harmed in the making of that CD).  But now I realize that I was, perhaps, a tad bit harsh in my comments, including my statement that "" With respect to the music on ""Pines,"" I want to ask, ""Who died?""  The music is ponderously slow, punctuated with pathetic efforts at instrumental innovation, and the lyric is delivered as if Alison Sudol has COPD.""

Further comments were even more overwrought, and I apologize for any suggestions that Alison Sudol had been hit in the head with a hammer, or that she should, in essence, physically return to that one cell in the sea.

Yes, she broke my heart with Pines, but the fact is that I love and constantly listen to AFF's first two CDs, and most of all that I love Alison's voice.  Love is not a light switch, something you can turn on and off.  It endures, like Alison's songs, even if in the end it does not bring happiness.  As Woody Allen once wrote, in the movie Love and Death,
""To love is to suffer,
To avoid suffering, one must not love,
But then one suffers from not loving.
Therefore, to love is to suffer,
Not to love is to suffer,
To suffer is to suffer.

""To be happy is to love,
To be happy, then, is to suffer,
But suffering makes one unhappy.
Therefore, to be unhappy
One must love, or love to suffer,
Or suffer from too much happiness.""

So, Adele, it's over.  Lisa Hannigan and Dido, thank you for some sweet moments, but my hearts belongs to Alison ... for now, and until I thrown the switch."
"Disappointing <SEP> This album was a disappointment after falling in love with A Fine Frenzy's album ""One Cell in the Sea"".  I bought this disc for my husband as a Christmas present, and I think he listened to it about once and then never again.  I thought he would appreciate the nature theme, but the sound is just too different from her more recent stuff to be interesting to him.  Bummer."
Yawn <SEP> I loved A Fine Frenzy's first two albums so much that I bought this one despite what I had heard about it.  It is rather lackluster almost the entire way through.  A good album to lull me off to sleep.  Sorry.
"My friend likes Rap so he gave me the money to buy it <SEP> But man I hate all the stupid stuff they say in it.
Crap is Rap without the C remember that!"
"Feeling this track!! <SEP> Nice collaboration with Kirko Bangz, Meek Mill is stepping it up this is a more of motivational track for me..."
"Playing this song first thing in the morning makes me feel like jumping out of bed and kickig the day's ass <SEP> Fairly uplifting vibe.
Whenever I need a little motivation I listen to it.
Playing this song first thing in the morning makes me feel like jumping out of bed and kickig the day's ass!"
Great Band <SEP> Very Heavy  Awesome
Five Stars <SEP> Great song by Avenged Sevenfold for a great video game soundtrack.
dope <SEP> this joint is a banger...make sure u get the whole album 2b original&show support 4the artist&chino xl is a dope underground rapper thats down wit my favorite rappers
"Pre-fab DIY...Maybe? <SEP> Pop music, pure pop music, with all the syrup and terseness, has had an injection of both taste and maturity in the last handful of years, especially when it comes to female vocalists.  Jessie Ware, Janelle Monae, and Icona Pop lead the pack in revitalizing female pop and, in doing so, putting out some of the best pop music today.

Enter Sky Ferreira.  The ""Ghost"" EP sounds like a girl who knew she wanted to be a singer but wasn't sure into what niche she fit.  Whether or not her writing or singing skills set her apart seems to be irrelevant, just get the product out so the ""career"" can get kick-started.  Every song flirts with a different ""style"" of music, not actual genres, just generic radio simulations thereof.  ""Lost in My Bedroom"" and ""Red Lips""  have pseudo-electro leanings, but sound like nothing that actual electro (not electronic) musicians would be inspired to put out.  ""Sad Dream"" is a travesty, a poorly written cross between alt-country and Nora Jones-ish adult contempo, with a chorus that sounds like it was scrawled across a notebook while she was bored in history class. The title track is the worst song on the album...it's just boring.

""Everything is Embarassing"" is, however, a terrific song.  The simple kick throughout is hollow and deep, the minimalist piano works well with it, and though her voice never really ""pushes"" itself, the song works in it's restraint.  So, 1/6 songs is not so bad...

Ultimately, however, Sky Ferreira fails because of her transparency.  The pre-fabrication of these tracks is hard to ignore.  When an ""artist"" (I hesitate to use that word, but I wouldn't dare call her a legitimate singer) is so young and new with so little material, yet has large production music videos, it becomes obvious that there is backing that less fortunate (but much more talented) musicians can't take advantage of.  This fact wouldn't bother me if Sky didn't come across as feigning authenticity.  This EP is a sampler, NOT a sampling of her various influences, it is a samplER to fish for what fans will want, and therefor, how to make the most cash once a full length arrives.

Indie cred she (somehow) gets.  I think it comes less form her actual talents and more from her willingness to network and flirt with the right people.  It's also very likely that she grew up with connections that gave her an edge.  In the end, save for ""Everything is Embarrassing"", this is poorly thought out music hoping for an image that will work. It comes from disingenuous motives and is likely to be rejected by anyone who looking for something unique and heartfelt."
"The guy's voice isn't terrible, but it's definitely not as good as the ... <SEP> Just pay the extra $0.30 for the Psy version.  The guy's voice isn't terrible, but it's definitely not as good as the original."

"Half-a$&ed Psy copy?  screwed up mix tape?  No idea! <SEP> I bought the extended Gangnan style mix for my workout, and was really disappointed.

It doesn't sound like Psy---my guess is that a.) some guy just knocked off him--very possibly a non-Korean speaker due to the weird inflection;  (b.) they got Psy on a really bad day, and he didn't give a crap;  or (c.) one of the above AND the mix engineer accidentally cut most mid bass from the vocal track, and tried to cover it with a generic euro bass beat.

Try listening to this track.  Then listen to the original.  You should hear what I mean.

For what it's worth, this is my first one star review in years.  :("
"Two Stars <SEP> Like the movie ""Airplane"", this is dumb but (stupidly) enjoyable.  I wonder why I bought it..."
my favorite <SEP> This is my favorite rendition of Foggy Mountain Breakdown out of the many that I have heard in my life.
"Powerful!! <SEP> I love this song, simple but powerful!! This song lifts me. I sing along and declare it...""to let the enemy know - I come against everything that is not like God!"" Battle cry!"
"Fashawn ruined this album for me <SEP> Up until this, I have liked every other murs album, but this one had too much fashawn and not enough murs. Although I like his ideas, I don't think fashawn's voice or flow was anything special it just drowned out murs who has a softer more laid back voice. Also the beats left something to be desired. I would be hard pressed to come up with a song on the cd worth putting it in for."
For Lovers Of Poe <SEP> A lot of fantastic stories with good reading. Great for lovers of Poe.
Good purchase. <SEP> Good ringtone.
"Pines is lovely <SEP> This whole album is lovely. Pines is my favourite of A Fine Frenzy's albums. This song is beautiful, as all the others on the album."
"Great upbeat tune <SEP> The song always makes me feel pumped about starting the day! Also, it brings back great memories of New Years'."
"praise worthy <SEP> Exceptional praise n worship....word filled spirit delivering, song of the day, hour, moment. Praise the Lord. Great author Truly enjoyed"
One Star <SEP> This is not arabic .. this is SHAMEFUL
"One of the best <SEP> As usual his lyrics and punchlines are some of the best. To me he is a better punchline mc and has better metaphors then Little Wayne. But as is the case with all underground rappers, the production could be better. Its not his fault he can't afford beats from Dre or Swizz Beats"
"Best Ever From the Best Yet! <SEP> Chino XL has always been a lyrical genius and this album is no exception. On a lot of artists recordings you want to hear the guest spots but with Chino, I just want to hear Chino. Best album of the year and if it doesn't go platinum, I have lost all faith in modern day Hip Hop fans."
"This One's A Bit Odd... <SEP> This halloween soundtrack does sound like a bunch of different sound pieces sewn together, but it is surprisingly charming. Though for some, it may sound a bit hokey. It starts off with the immortal J.S. Bach's Toccata then drifts off into silly retro music. A few sound effects are sprinkled in.

This soundtrack will depend on you liking a hodgepodge of sounds, some not quite sounding like they belong together. I found it an interesting listen, though I may choose another soundtrack to play for halloween..."
These are NOT the greatest Blues Songs of ALL Time. <SEP> These are NOT the greatest Blues Songs of ALL Time.
"Go Back.  Not karaoke! <SEP> Without buying or even hearing more than the first 30 seconds (in preview) I'm giving this 1 star because nowhere in any of the accompanying material does it clearly state whether this is a karaoke disk and the preview features an actual vocalist.  Since I arrived at this (sales) link from the Amazon karaoke trail, in my ears, it should have been karaoke.  If I'm wrong, explain the singer."
"Four Stars <SEP> good memories, wonderful sound"
Great <SEP> Love it
"Great for Halloween! <SEP> I was in the store over Halloween, and heard this playing.  I quickly located the CD player and opened it (yes, a bold move in a store) and noted what was playing.  When I got home, a quickly visited amazon.com and ordered it as well as ""Little Fugue in G Minor.""  I burned a CD with them both playing over and over until the CD was full.  It was the best Halloween ever!"
Sucks <SEP> Not the original theme from show
Bad <SEP> Not original cd or case misspelled the album cover
Perfect <SEP> Awesome album. Absolutely love it
great music <SEP> great song and this is just the beginning. have seen a couple gigs via justin.tv/thebefordlive- and checked out soundcloud. will be waiting for more to come out.
"I miss the great talent of Mr <SEP> one of my favs for Christmas, I miss the great talent of Mr. Luther"

Five Stars <SEP> Awesome!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!!
"No meaning = no fun <SEP> Just like ""Can't Hold Us,"" but a really dumb topic."
"Campy <SEP> The person who is reading this has what sounds like a silly voice to my American ears. Also, the sexual aspect isn't really well written, like either whoever this is doesn't really understand much about how female sexuality works, or like they don't want to talk much about it.

I paid a buck and bought it mostly for laughs so I don't really care but there's better available for free online."
Amazing <SEP> Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are so talented. Their songs are inspiring and I just love listening to it in my car.
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"Amish Songs <SEP> I liked some of the sillier songs because I had never heard them before.
Certain songs I did not care for because I couldn't relate to them, otherwise they all
sounded great."
Malmsteen at his best <SEP> A very beautiful power ballad by one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Simply amazing with a great guitar solo. Neo-classical guitar at its best.
Four Stars <SEP> Great song
"Pre teens will love it <SEP> After 3-4 years of growing up, this music has an OK beat to it, but just thinking about it, it's very boring and overplayed."
Five Stars <SEP> My work out song!
R Kelly Always Makes Great Remixes <SEP> R Kelly is a talented artist. This remix is often on repeat while sitting in traffic or headed to the gym
Genius <SEP> Love all of Mr. Kelly's work.  When I heard this song I said he has done it again. You will not be disappointed.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"wonderful worship music <SEP> I love all my worship music i get from Amazon, its easy top order and download. 10,000 Reasons is am amazing song!"
"A little slow <SEP> I LOVE this song & want to sing it for Church.
This version is slower than the original, but I like the sound quality and the instrumentation."
"sucks! <SEP> i really didn't like it that much i can sing a better song and write one with my eyes closed. others might like it but i really didn't, i am not hating but maybe its just not my style,but good luck with it man."
Bad music <SEP> Bad music.  Bought it because our last name is Metz!!  Maybe I'm too senior to appreciate this type of music.
"Not to my tastes <SEP> I don't normally care for pop, but tried this as a sample.  This didn't change my mind about pop music."
"Good Rockin' Tonight <SEP> Subpop has been getting soft on me for the last few years - not that there's anything wrong with that - but I'm always hoping for some rockin' tunes to come crashing through the speakers like the Subpop of old. Metz certainly delivers on that. This is some good stuff. Headache starts off with some solid drumming before the guitar & vocals kick in. What's it sound like? A little like Negative Creep by Nirvana. The drumming reminds me of Totally Wired by The Fall from 30 years ago. But it all sounds fresh as it's even better than the two songs I mentioned. I think I already said it, but it bears repeatin': Some good stuff."
Perfect! <SEP> Minimal and dark. Perfect!
"Not my type of music <SEP> Tried it as a sample, but it didn't convince me that I would like more.  I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not to my taste."
"he sounds like the cure <SEP> but worse, and even less enthusiastic. THe beat is very swede-pop, and cheerful even as the singer drones on in his dull flat voice."
black marble <SEP> just not my type of music I am more of andrew bird listner or dave matthews but for his following i guess he bould be great
"Question: Can Fang enhance Dylan? <SEP> Hey, the Dylan canon is up for grabs, and every one of us likes to play our personal favorites.  I don't fault Fang for trying, but what can anyone add to a Dylan classic? It's all been tried, and nothing comes close to Dylan himself. Maybe I'll change my mind if Dylan puts ""Zimmy"" in black tape on the back of his guitar and jumps around when he's performing this song."
"Amazon has delivered yet another fine product and I love the fact that the songs ... <SEP> As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the file was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine product and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great service, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!  I love the ease in which music can be selected, listened to, and backed up via Amazon's digital services."
Yes! <SEP> What's not to love.
Cruising music at its best <SEP> I purchased this after my convertible. Song of my summer!
I wish I would have ordered the clean version. <SEP> I wish I would have ordered the clean version.  My daughter fusses at me everytime it comes on in the car
"Sad but true song for many bar goer's <SEP> The sincerity of this song is beautiful, although I do not have a drinking problem, I know many lost soul's who do and this song brings tears to my eye's for one I know in particular."
One Star <SEP> Don't know why I bought this
"Not Original <SEP> Not even close to the original, sounds more like a karaoke version of the song. Pretty disappointed so many Freestyle artists felt the need to re-record what was already great only to make them worse."
Five Stars <SEP> it was ok not great
"The music is not as good as I thought it would be <SEP> The music is not as good as I thought it would be.  Nor is it good for sleeping for me.  Most importantly, the CD sounds like it has many cracks which seems to get more widespread across more songs with each play.  The quality of the disc seems poor.  I would return it if I could."
Download works great. <SEP> CD does not play well.  Download works great.
Five Stars <SEP> I love it!!
"Where is the usage rights and license info? <SEP> I downloaded this library because we are posting a science fiction short film.  But I cannot find any usage or license information anywhere for this product, which I presume means that it is a sound effects library that is basically useless since no right are granted to reuse it in other works or productions."
I only listen to this when I am feeling 'yucky' ... <SEP> I only listen to this when I am feeling 'yucky' such as when I have been around toxic people or I have worried myself sick over something at work.  It really helps me start the next morning fresh and open to everything around me.
"Clean your Soul with an Energy Detox <SEP> About this track:  So I added this to my play list when I was feeling like I wanted a little extra boost- this is towards the end of my play list so I cannot tell you exactly what it sounds like or does since I am too deep under when it is playing.  I can tell you that I feel lighter as if the pain and pressure of the previous day was washed away.  I feel like I am more positive overall and that there world is no longer out to get me.  I guess you can say I feel as if my soul was cleaned while I was sleeping so that sensation alone makes this track very valuable to me.

~@~ My Thoughts About The Sleep Learning Series Sleep Sanctuary ~@~

Personal Note: I have been a fan and user of the Binaural Beat's for a few years now until my Kindle suggested this one night when I was having sleep issues. WOW All I can say is that this stuff is the best out on the market to date! It works! Works so much that when I started using it I was waking up with horrid headaches. I soon learned that is a sign that my mind is over active during my sleep cycle so I had to adjust my playlist. I went a bit wild when I first learned how powerful Sleep Learning is

Voice: The female voice is very soothing so it is one you really want to use while sleeping. At first I woke up with headaches but then I adjusted the tracks and played some more soothing music to help me relax. The end of my play list always contains a Rest & Energy Boost.

Price: I pay around 1.99 for each but buying the album is a better deal. You can adjust your play lists from there.

When To Use: Oddly there was no suggestions but I use this at night when I am trying to sleep. I leave it playing throughout my entire sleep cycle.

Why I use Sleep Learning: I use this to aid with: Sleep Issues, Restless Leg, Focus, ADD, Psoriasis, Healing, Chakra Cleansing, Anger Issues, Dream Work, Energy & Cleansing & Boosting, Saving Money and assistance with College Studies (Being an older student is hard so any extra boost I can get I will take)

Starting Track Suggestion: Deep Sleep Induction by Sleep Learning Series (A MUST to start because it will put you out! I am out within 10 minutes) You can find it here but if you get an album it will be included as your first track.:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B008IMZN3Q/dp/B008IMZN3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B008IMZN3Q</a>

Final Track Suggestion: Energy Boost - Since I was getting headaches I make certain to play an energy cleanse and booster track for when I am waking up. You can find Energy Boost here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B00ADYYZXQ/dp/B00ADYYZXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00ADYYZXQ</a>

Mixing Brands? NO - There is a pattern that gets established in your Deep Sleep Induction track. All of the songs by Sleep Learning has that same pattern. When I added a track from a different maker it woke me up every time when I got to that track. I believe you need to remain with the same pattern.

Headaches? This is a sign that you are working your mind too much and too fast while sleeping. Like I said Sleep Learning is very powerful and it works so be mindful of this. I suggest starting on a Friday when you have the weekend off so you can take a few days to adjust your playlists and figure out what works best for you. My headaches started when I was making a 40 song playlist and mixing brands. As soon as I reduced my play list and remained with the same brand they were no longer a factor. I simply make certain that I end with an energy boost or some type of track that will make my mind feel as if it slept for 8 hours."
"Five Stars <SEP> Love Muse. They can never go wrong, so artfully wonderful."
"This band strangely has seemed to become puppets of some ... <SEP> This band strangely has seemed to become puppets of some underlying cause, at least from their lyrics it would seem so."
"I have heard it several times and was pretty familiar but it wasn't until my dad played it ... <SEP> Hahaha. So this song was recently ""discovered"" by my dad and I had to laugh. I have heard it several times and was pretty familiar but it wasn't until my dad played it for everyone and got so into it that I knew I had to make the purchase so I was ready whenever we go on our next road trip."
Love Muse <SEP> This band is so unique and rocks the house!  I love their videos!  Their songs make me dance wherever i am!
Five Stars <SEP> Ok.
"My daughter loves this. <SEP> My daughter had this record when she was a little girl, and she loved it. She is now in her late forties and was so excited when I found this on Amazon and bought it for her."
Five Stars <SEP> memories!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this music.
Five Stars <SEP> Has some really good songs that helps remind you what matters most.
Great track <SEP> Love this song.  Discovered it cause a friend of mine in a band does a harder blues rock version of it.
"mislabeled <SEP> While Rockboat CDs are great, this one is not from 2001!
Sister Hazel & Dexter Freebish (maybe Edwin), were the only bands on 2001.
I think this is more close to the 2003 lineup."
"Disappointed!! <SEP> this is just the instrumentals, when I thought I was purchasing the actual song!  Very misleading! Will never purchase again!"
"bad title.. <SEP> This track is just the bed, no lyrics.. no idea why they titled it ""explicit""! Thankfully it was only .89 cents!"
"A great turning point in their history <SEP> I had this on vinyl when it first came out, but sadly sold it when I got it on CD in the 90s (I no longer owned a record player anyway). A few years later, after the CD was no longer available, this was one of a bunch of discs that were stolen from me.

You either love or hate DA, so telling someone what's great about them is hard. Since their prior album, Horrendous Disc, distanced them from their country roots, they became hard to classify....

Sounds like  a cornucopia of classic rock sounds: The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Clash..."
Five Stars <SEP> good cd
background music for singing <SEP> had background vocals and made it a little harder to sing with.
"This is wonderful, I didn't know this recording existed <SEP> I was there.  This is the recording.  This is wonderful, I didn't know this recording existed.  Was such a good tour, it's on my top 5 or top 10 favorite shows."
One Star <SEP> A total bulls*** rip-off! I wasn't what was advertised! Shame on the false advertisement!
great dvd <SEP> it was nice to hear somebody actually say something nice about elvis for once and to know that larry really does care for elvis for him not his money
"Not the whole song. <SEP> I hate to be critical of an item like this, but it only the first and last verse."
"sweet, good definition <SEP> Trendy, sweet, good definition, and popular for several generations...."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
"... Chayanne's movie ""Dance With Me"" 1997 ( it's a nice album to have in my collection and use it ... <SEP> I heard this dance song on Vanessa Williams / Chayanne's movie ""Dance With Me"" 1997
( it's a nice album to have in my collection and use it for dance halls, balls, competitions and events (including weddings and parades)."
AWSOME <SEP> This song has a good tune and makes me happy when I listen to it. Macklemore made a great hit that I love.
Two Stars <SEP> Never was a fan of this song. Tried it with a video I was making.
"Always loved this piece <SEP> Always loved this piece, especially when I was a child. It never seems to grow old, and by its rhythms suggests skating on an ice rink as the snow falls. Wonderful"
One Star <SEP> bad purchase
One Star <SEP> perfect
"My Favorite Billie - tasty accompaniment by great jazzmen <SEP> This is the best recording I've heard by Billie Holiday - in no small part due to the spare and tasty support of jazz greats: Red Mitchell, Ben Webster, Barney Kessel, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, and Jimmy Rowles.  Lady Day's voice is in beautifully mature form.  The recording is clear and sharp. And the selection of tunes wonderful.  Also a delight for similar reasons is Billie's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-for-Distingu-Lovers-Bonus-Track-Version/dp/B00BJCTT4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs for Distingu Lovers (Bonus Track Version)</a>, especially the first 6 tracks which comprised its original release, featuring the same lineup of musicians.  The accompaniment here and there is special - the ideal setting for Billie Holiday's singing."

One Star <SEP> Not good
"sucks <SEP> I do not recommend to order this they do not work on any system, could a pirated copy, very unhappy"
Wonderful song <SEP> Fulfilled my mother's listening need. She is the gospel lover of the family so it brought tears to her eyes.
"amazing <SEP> I have seen the show already, but  quality of this live album never ceases to amaze. The crowd noise doesn't over power the vocalists and the Starkids really shine. Everyone should buy this and enjoy."
"I thought would be better <SEP> I heard ""Freak"" & ""I Spider"" and really enjoyed the beats and grooves on both songs.  My thinking was, ""wow, the only two songs on this album I've heard and they are both really good.  The whole album must be great.""  Well, once again, there two best songs that I heard were the only two good songs on the album.  Overall this genre isn't my cup of tea but there are some exceptions such as Gorillaz & Fat Boy Slim who consistently add some fantastic ideas into their style.  I was hoping that I Monster was going to be added to that list.  Unfortunately in my opinion, they miss."
Dope! <SEP> Pretty solid effort by a legendary duo in Hip-hop.  Show is still diggin some classic stuff.  In constant rotation in my car and iPod
Five Stars <SEP> This Canadian band is great. One of my favorite albums.
Two Stars <SEP> cds were fine but book was in horrible ripped condition
"The art is great, but the music, not so much <SEP> Bland, meandering pointless songs. Dumb lyrics and an awful singing voice. Just my take on this take on darkwave, but it proves how much better the Europeans are in making memorable records. One to skip for sure. And, contrary to a prior review, most of this isn't anywhere close to being ethereal. If the band named itself after the moody Cure b-side from their High single, and if they had recorded more songs in that vein, as track 1 is, things might've looked up to look down and be a good depressed, and not schizo and trying to find its own voice. Just my take."
Better than ZWANZIG ZWOLF 2012 <SEP> I have been a fan of HUG since Ausgeflippt but I was a little disappointed when I picked up Zwanzig Zwolf 2012 and that is why I was a little hesitant with picking up Born To Be Heiled. I'm glad that I did get it because there are only 3 tracks that I cant get into where as for ZZ2012 there were only 3 or 4 tracks that I liked. In my opinion this should have seen the album after Scheissmessiah. Even though I kind of wish that they would go back to thier more industrial sound like on the first two albums I can still get into thier metal stuff as well. Over all Born To Be heiled is a decent metal album and worth picking up.
"A new theme for a HuG? <SEP> If Scheissmessiah challenged religious ideas, and 2012 was a beast of a future space rock album, then born to be heiled is a tribute to biker music.  But not the polite weekend ""rebels"" but real freaking bikers.  Dirty crank fueled outlaws that would fit right into a Rob Zombie movie.  But also to old timers who can't give up the thunder.  There's a certain type made for the bike... and just what kind of music does HuG think bikers like?  This kind.

Personally, I like the sludgy heavy riffs of everything since uber alles.  I mean, HuG is one of my favorite bands.  So, I respect their ideas - but this is the first album I didn't love immediately.  Which is probably not a bad thing.  It will take some time to grow, and may be my favorite of all!  I was expecting to be completely blown away by every track, but this is a slow burner.  You'll have to let it grow on you (if you're not a biker, presumably)

Something that's odd about it is that Vas Kallas sings all the songs, well, all but one.  And the lone Loopy track is... well, it's 12 bar blues.  It's industrial 12 bar blues, but I guess bikers like 12 bar so I can't complain.  It's probably most peoples favorite, so what do I know?

In the end it's still good music, and may serve as a good jumping off point for new listeners.  They're still coming up with new fresh things and haven't abandoned their brutal crushing and goofy qualities.  HuG, don't ever stop making music because you do it like no one else."
Fantastic ballad <SEP> Gorgeous ballad or mood piece.  Willis' playing expresses so much emotion.
"Great message! <SEP> Like the reviewer before me, I am also amazed at the talent of this 10 year old.  I hope Jolie's strong message will encourage all kids and adults to take a stand against bullying."
One Star <SEP> Not the whole song parts of the movie!!
One Star <SEP> Not song only and preview doesn't allow you to know that.
Not the song - <SEP> Not the song - a dialog.  Should be more clear when you  purchase
"includes some of the narrative <SEP> This one goes back into the narrative, and is much more than just the song"
"Not the whole song <SEP> This is a little of the song, and then a lot of just audio from the movie. If you want the whole actual song, this is not that."
DISAPPOINTMENT! <SEP> WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  I needed the entire song to play while I was portraying the Grinch in our shows!  All it was was the opening lines than a butch of nonsense!
"Not the full song. <SEP> It isn't the full song. Plus, I was expecting to be able to just download and not have to listen via the Amazon Music app, which I don't use."
Great Music <SEP> Awesome brother in Christ - Positive is a young brother who has a love for God and you can hear it too
"just get the CD <SEP> You won't be disappointed with this one. Every track has that ""just play me"" quality. First album was great and so is his second album."
Positive Delivers!!!!! <SEP> This cd is off the hook. Positive came through again. His first cd was amazing and this one is just as good. Keep reppin the King my brother and everyone who loves music should buy this cd you will not be disappointed.
Awesome!!! <SEP> This album is awesome!!!
"""THE"" GOTHIC INDUSTRIAL BAND.. <SEP> THIS ALBUM IS SOLID AND MOODY I MEAN IT HAS SOMEONE INSIDE OF IT. THE POSTURE IT CREATES IS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS' RESTRAINT AND DANCE."
"Bitter For Sweet <SEP> I'm a fan of AFI. I heard of Blaqk Audio and thought that I should check them out. I didn't like there music because I'm not into Electronica. This song did intrigue me; mostly because of the lyrics, but after a while I got used to the actual music. This song should have been included in the album DecemberUnderground by AFI. Nonetheless, it's a great song."
sad that there are not all the song of the films <SEP> I bought this to be able to enjoy more the music and songs of the film...but no lots of the songs were missing and i could not find the ones i enjoyed during the movie. If you are looking for the love songs...they are not there...I m even planning to sell it back on amazon...or ebay.
Five Stars <SEP> Voice just turns me on.
"I love Lana Del Rey <SEP> I love Lana Del Rey.  I'm getting old and don't like a lot of the ""new stuff"", but Lana really has the talent, the voice, and (generally) blows me away."
Four Stars <SEP> great Gospel music.
Jim Reeves My Happiness <SEP> Quality of sound and add his voice - how can you not love it?  It will bring happiness to me for a long time.
A poor rendition. <SEP> NOT the original.  A poor rendition.
"Lame <SEP> Only buy this is you think Brylcreem is still the finest aphrodisiac in the land. Otherwise, ignore this festering cesspool of Oil of Go Away"
Five Stars <SEP> Love the music. Thanks.
"Not a great album <SEP> This is much more of a mainstream pop and country-rock album than it is psychedelic rock. There are maybe two songs here that try to attain the level of being psychedelic, but compared to their other album, ""Home Grown Stuff,"" is 100x better than this record. I'm not trashing the band by any means - I'm a huge fan, but I'm glad at least I got to listen to it on this affordable $20 CD as opposed to dropping $100 or more on an original LP hoping that it'd be similar to their psychedelic rock work, because you can't compare the two. It's pleasant, but I was really disappointed considering my expectations."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent Box Set
great track <SEP> good track and phenomenal band. the cover art is also pretty amazing was my background for my phone for a while.
"The lyrics are good, but the beats are really weak and lazy <SEP> I ended up deleting it. The lyrics are good, but the beats are really weak and lazy."
nothing like earlier work <SEP> horrible album.  i am a dead prez longtime fan.  they can do so much better.  i was disappointed; i had high hopes for what the band would become.
"disappointed <SEP> Not the song I was listening to on pandora when I decided to buy it.
Very disappointed.
This version is completely different."
Five Stars <SEP> What's not to LOVE about Polish Christmas Songs :-)
One Star <SEP> This is NOT a performance track.
memorys of my childhood <SEP> im only 40y old and i love some George and Tammy i went seen him in his last ever concert in knoxville Tn. He was weak but still an awesome singer very tallented. R.I.P George and Tammy
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite Tome Jones songs - was the ringtone on my cell phone for years. ha!
Beautiful incredible! <SEP> This is a new favorite of mine. The message is so true and needed. Very easy to listen to as well.
Five Stars <SEP> country is the best
"One star for the abysmal MP3 quality <SEP> My one-star review is not for the music or the performer, but for the abysmal quality of the MP3. This is the second album of Amazon MP3s I've downloaded that has a distorted, ""fluttering"" quality with audible gaps and severe audio degradation. Listen to the samples on the Amazon page with headphones on--they sound identical to the MP3s once you've download them--and then compare to the same samples on iTunes, which are pristine by comparison. I've downloaded many decent MP3s from Amazon, but this one is literally unlistenable."
"Excellent playing and recording <SEP> I'm not an expert on classical music but I love Debussy. This is an excellent set and very well recorded. I can't help but remark on how FRENCH looking Aimard is in the cover photo. There are a lot of excellent Debussy sets out there though perhaps not so many that limit themselves to the Preludes. I always liked Peter Frankl's though I suppose it is no longer available. I won't try to rate them, but this one has the advantage of up to date sound. You really get a feeling for the splendor of Aimard's piano, the beauty of tone and the dynamics."
whens the next full length release? <SEP> I've been patiently waiting for some new material by the flask.  These tracks do not disappoint!  Fans of the band will recognize the songs from their high energy live set.  It is good to finally get access to studio versions of Swing and My Name Is Cancer.  This will hold me over for a while 'till the next full release.  Hope to see 'em again at the Brass Rail soon!
"good music <SEP> GOT THIS ONE FREE
glad i  listened to this one

great to listen to
good music
that i loaded on my mp3 player"
"Not A Fan <SEP> I think the title of the album says it all. ""Eat Your Young"", free or not, is not something you should get. Period."
Five Stars <SEP> I like the song it was well done
Great tune <SEP> Fun song to listen to and play along with. It moves along very smooth moving song. I find myself humming it quite a few times during the day. Definitely a must have for any music library.
"Pretty sure it is impossible for them to make bad music. <SEP> Buy this EP now! You will not be disappointed. I love this EP- hit play never skip it, but the two stand out tracks are definitely ""Be the Void"" and ""What a Fool"", but as with all of their music you never know what will be your favorite will be, until months or even years from now. Sometimes I feel like I have a part-time job promoting this band, I tell anyone who is looking for new and honest music to listen to them- it is modern and a throwback at the same time. I look forward to seeing them again in November. Lastly this band is consistently putting out great music on a steady basis- if you get into them, then you will see the frequency of their albums, and how often they tour. There is nothing better in the world, than not having to be that patient for greatness."
go Gutta G <SEP> This man go too hard. The sax is crazy too. free Morgan!! It has a nice early morning flow. I listen to it before work or while cleaning.
Five Stars <SEP> great song
Beautiful song and voice <SEP> Beautiful  song and voice. I like music that touches the heart and this one does that.
"Counterpoint <SEP> Amazing voice, great harmonies, solid instrumentation for a very old and familiar hymn. Seems a perfect counterpoint to the ""Text"" of SOA."
"Great Music <SEP> I love this show, but what always sticks out is the fabulous music.  I always think of my dad, so I bought this for him and he absolutely loved it.  The songs are hauntingly good and are timeless enough to be appreciated by different generations."
Five Stars <SEP> My 2nd favorite versions!!
"Chill Music <SEP> I ran across Aman looking for a camera. Someone used one of his songs for a video he made using some canon. The video was good and I liked the music. Luckily, someone could identify who it was and Amazon has Niklas Aman in its MP3 collection. This album is definitely chill. The first time I listened to it I fell asleep for 4 songs straight. I listened to it all the way through again and am looking forward to buying more of his works. I just wish it was on vinyl or cd. 1st track ""Wings"" is my favorite."
Awesome beat <SEP> Being old it's hard to find new music I like but this is great stuff.
Awesome. <SEP> Spirit filled and moving.  Love this album. Want more.
"This gorgeous music sounds much better on YouTube than when I play this purchased track ... <SEP> This gorgeous music sounds much better on YouTube than when I play this purchased track on my Kindle or on my laptop. It's tinny with grinding background noise like an air conditioner is running on the Kindle and on my laptop -- not so on the same version at YouTube (both Kindle and laptop). I can't see how to ""return"" the digital file. It was only 89 cents, but I won't use it. I tried to get a graphic equalizer for Kindle, but it was blocked as an unauthorized download. Didn't want to chance it when I can go to YouTube to listen."
"the poorest sound quality i've heard since CD's came out <SEP> I heard this on our local classical music radio station, and loved it.  So i bought it here.
But I couldn't even finish listening to this once.  it sounds like watching an old recording on an old TV.
Too bad, the music probably could be beautiful."
"LOVE!LOVE!LOVE! <SEP> I love this song so inspirationalI I truly love the music tracks on this song.

I was nicely written. s"
"Precious Memories <SEP> wonderful music, Gene is one of the best country music fans, thank you amazon!"
love good music <SEP> good sound quality and clean music.and bass i love bass and dubstep music.i don't what to write .have to make so many words
Good classical music <SEP> These hymns are varied and the instruments and vocal blend well.  It is soothing and inspiring.  It appeals to my taste in music.
Five Stars <SEP> Very good song for offering collection!
Two Stars <SEP> Song gets old quick.
The reason for the one star is that the disc ... <SEP> The reason for the one star is that the disc was blank or wouldn't play on my system.  I also ordered Spiral of Now and it was blank also
"Be aware <SEP> Just be aware that this particular copy of the song is part of a mix-tape, therefore the track starts where another song is ending and there are various interruptions that sound like babies talking and other random sounds that are just taking away from enjoyment of the song. Unless you like that type of thing..."
Not great <SEP> Not a fan of the steam punk look (where's the guy who used to wear suits?!) so maybe I'm just biased to classic Rick Springfield. My opinion is he's trying too hard to be relevant and trying to be cutting edge. I only made it through once and nothing compelled me to listen again. This is the last current RS album I will buy...
Five Stars <SEP> GREAT
Five Stars <SEP> This chant worked out great for my son's soccer highlight slideshow.
Five Stars <SEP> Best Music for meditation and relax
wost version <SEP> Worst version of bear hunt. My students hated it. They wondered why they ruined the fun song. This was for a kinder class.
Four Stars <SEP> It is relaxing and we like it.
OG Ska is back <SEP> Awesome CD.  Just what I expected.
"Five Stars <SEP> i heard this on the best canadian t.v. show since PSI Factor and Wipeout Canada; Cracked, LOVE that show"
"pleasant listening experience <SEP> Combined with Hope, the listening experience proved rewarding."
"Disappointed <SEP> I am disappointed by this song, the lyrics are terrible and sound like they were written by a ten year old. The riff isn't very original. Waste of my money."
"annoying background noise <SEP> There is an background sound track which I guess makes it seems mystical.  To me it was just annoying.  I think you can find this free online, I wouldn't pay .99 for it again."
Great Song. Only Barbra Could make it the Best <SEP> I know Barbra is the GREATEST SINGER.  She can make you feel that you are actually there with her as she sings. She makes you feel what she is singing and she is the only person that can do it.
"Says it all... <SEP> ... simply...gently...a gift from the one who rescued my heart from total despair...the one 'I'll never forget."" Thank you so much honey. I love you :-*"
Eileen is the best of all Irish lasses <SEP> New World Records has provided a great service in issuing this recording of the complete original and revised scorees of Victor Herbert's Eileen.  Lary Moore's liner notes provide fascininating insights into the score and its changes.  Perhaps we can hope for future issues of other Herbert operettas that are done as well.
awesome song <SEP> One of my favorite by nonpoint it gets you pumped when running or working one of my personal favorites of all time
One Star <SEP> not one of my favorites.
6 Stars <SEP> would give more than 5 if I could. one of their best!
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent album - well constructed and solid all the way start to finish.
amazing <SEP> This song is a very upbeat breakup song. It features great tunes and crazy good lyrics. This song is a person favorite of mine by Allstar Weekend. It's a new side of Zachary Porter that you've never heard. Sit back and just listen.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent!
"Generic <SEP> If you're a fan of Woe, Is Me don't think you'll find the same sound when listening to Issues.  Issues is just another Rise Records cash cow because of the sudden fandom for Tyler Carter."
His best numbers <SEP> His best numbers. Great picking. Good singing.
"OH NO! <SEP> I was terribly distraught to realize that this album is NOT really Handel's Israel in Egypt, but a mishmash of stuff ... Arabic, Hebrew AND some Israel in Egypt thrown in ... with no apparent logic.  Terribly disappointing and very expensive to boot.  I was not really careful and didn't look at the playlist before purchasing.  Fortunately, AMAZON was sympathetic to my plight.  Don't buy this if what you want is HANDEL!  Try THE SIXTEEN...it's quite pure and wonderful!  This album was NOT for me!"
Four Stars <SEP> Great song.
Good Album! <SEP> I bought this album for my son and he is very happy because received a good album records in the best shape. Thank you!!!
Five Stars <SEP> I needed that
This IS not the Psychotica you think it is. <SEP> This IS not the Psychotica you think it is. Someone just ripped off their name to make a buck selling impossibly bad edm music.
Buy the original <SEP> A reinterpretation of the original..but it only proves what a iconic piece of music Mike Oldfields original is..I grew up hearing the single version and though it's listed on the mp3 on both Amazon and Google play it's not available..so sad because it's perfect for driving. That's what this copy is a substitute for.
"NICE MUSIC FOR PLEASANT MEMORIES (EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A HORROR MOVIE) <SEP> It's a bit nostalgic to hear the music remembering the tension building in the theater.  Audiences were more tender in those days.  Seeing a horror movie was a real roll coaster ride.  I enjoyed hearing it again and recommend it for those wanting to revisit the past.

As for the younger folk, it's only $1.29 for some pleasant real music (no synthesizer).  You may like it."
Sublime music <SEP> I listen to this almost every day as we are in the process of learning it for a performance with our Utah Voices group.  It's inspiring.
"The rap ruins it. <SEP> I love the original version of this song by Active Child, and was really excited to hear Ellie's take on the song. But then the whole vibe gets totally ruined at the end by Tinie Tempah. I skip to the next song every time he starts rapping. And I'm a fan of rap! His voice just does not match tone at all."
"didnt know there was rapping <SEP> the song is so beautiful and touching. then it is ruined by some unknown ""rapper"" and his mediocre verse. if ellie goulding is going to collaborate with another artist, she should make sure they are as good as her."
It  is  stupid  that  amazon doesn't have more description about this song <SEP> I am really disapointed  with  amazon I purchased already two songs  that were not what I wanted ......  I didn't want any rap  on this  song * hanging on by Ellie Goulding .... but  there  is  rap  ....  like  on the other song  I purchased  there  was  one stupid  that  cut off the song  to say  I was  out  for six months  now  I am back ...  what  is  the  point on  that  ... sometimes  you just  want  to hear  the  song  ...
"not what you expect <SEP> states nothing in the description about the rap toward the end of the song. Killed the entire vibe of the song.

I would give it 1 star, but it wasn't completely terrible quality. I really liked the song up until the rap part came in."
Nice single <SEP> I've heard this on the radio alot but seem to always catch the end or its a dj mix. I finally heard the full single and liked it.
"Not instrumental!!! <SEP> This is not an instrumental, there is actually singing on this track. Not cool, I bought this for my school Spring show and won't be able to use it..."
"Thank you MTVU! <SEP> I saw this video on MTVU and loved the style and flow of his rapping. I really believe in supporting music artists. So I was thrilled that I could buy the single. MTVU shows great new artists and stays away from top 40 as much as they can.
My friends always wonder where I find new music. I always say MTVU and Amazon!"
Good Song <SEP> I really like the lyrics and the beat for this song.  I can relate to how you want your girl to have eyes only for you as you have eyes only for her.
Don't buy this. <SEP> This is either a mistake or is just meant to be a voice sampling with sparse words. What you hear on the sample is what you get literally. Nothing.
Five Stars <SEP> one of my favorite recordings from this fine vocalist
Five Stars <SEP> NEVER HEARD OF HER but music is slammin!!!
love it <SEP> My friend liked this song and posted it on facebook. I downloaded it. I liked it. I would recommend this song to you.
"Classic <SEP> Always been a fan of Big Joe.
Not sure why I'm just now ""discovering"" this tune but it rocks.
TURN IT UP!"
wasn't familiar <SEP> I didn't know if I would like this song or not....I like Damien Rice..so I thought maybe it was similar ...but I don't care for this only because it is not what I would usually like ....others may love it
"great sound, interesting lyrics, nice <SEP> I withheld a 5th star only because my friend Isaac made a burn list with like a 10 or 15 minute version of this song that I love so much more.  The instrumental middle with the guitar in the longer version is so joyous, transitional, harmonic, happy, and ""dance-able.""  Still, a great song.  Interesting lyrics."
"REALLY???? <SEP> This song is a SNOOZE!!!!!  I've listened to it over and over trying to force myself to like it or at the very least stand it, but no sucess.  Definitely not a very good choice for 1st single. Song has been out for a week and no air-time here in Chicago.  Definitely hope CD is 100% better."
"Not a very good performance <SEP> I purchased the recording of Jim Curnow's ""Fanfare Prelude on 'Ode to Joy.'""  The recording quality is poor.  The MP3 previews sounded somewhat indistinct, and the actual MP3 was just as bad.

However, it is the performance which garners the abysmal one-star rating.
Good points:
1.  Intonation is acceptable.
2.  Tempo is acceptable.

Bad points:
Phrasing is awful - if there's a phrase ending at the end of a bar line, the ensemble drops almost a full beat at the end of the note.  There is no line to the music, giving it all the musicianship of a MIDI playback.  Articulations are not clear, dynamic contrast almost non-existent.  After listening to other sample MP3s, it seems that the conductor has no familiarity with the pieces he is composing - the tempi on the Holst ""First Suite"" are incorrect and stylistic elements as well as phrasing are inconsistent with the written music.

I have no idea as to the level of the ensemble nor as to the purpose of the recording.  By the title of the CD, it appears that the group released this recording as a 110-year celebration of something.  Unfortunately, the performance is simply bad.

The recording serves no musical vision, other than perhaps to say, ""LOOK!  We released a CD.""  It is poorly performed, poorly recorded, and they should be ashamed to have this available."
usual BV <SEP> This song is kind of cute dance/ club song you'd expect from Bobby V. It's more of a song you would listen to on a date night or with your significant other. Decent beat/tune.
"meh -not his best foot forward <SEP> I am not sure why I bought this song. I wish Amazon had a longer play sample. I bought a few  other songs on the album though and I really enjoy listening to them, but This one ... meh"
"Lovely to hear <SEP> Ekaterina Zytseva beautifully displays her extraordinary sensitivity,  artistry and versatility in this solo album.  Born in Switzerland, she is beloved in Spain because her performance is exquisite."
"I am very disappointed and do not fill as though this is proper <SEP> The song cut off, before it was completed. I am very disappointed and  do not fill as though this is proper. Do you??"
I love the way he puts his all into this song <SEP> I love the way he puts his all into this song. It causes a stirring in my soul whenever I listen to it. ANOINTED voice!.
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!???? <SEP> This song is too much of a drag & snooze for my taste.  I am a Thalia fan and because of it I've tried forcing myself to like it or at very best stand it, but no sucess. I am totally disappointed in this 1st single of her upcoming albumn HABITAME SIEMPRE due to drop on Nov. 19th. If this is the 1st single I don't even want to imagine how the rest of the albumn is going to be.

Esta cancion es super lenta e aburrida para mi gusto.  Soy fan de Thalia y es por esta razon que e intentando ver la manera de que la cancion me agrade pero no he tenido exito.  Estoy totalmente desepcionado por este el primer sencillo de el nuevo CD HABITAME SIEMPRE que esta progamado para salir a la venta el proximo 19 de Noviembre.  Si este fue el primer sencillo, no quiero ni imaginar como sera el resto de el album."
"Not the best version <SEP> This was not a good version of this song.  Too bad the sample didn't clue me that it was
not the version I was looking for."
"This is not talent <SEP> Seriously this girl cannot sing and obviously the band cannot play
I've heard many Euro artists and American pop artists who can play and sing much better than her so I do not see or understand what the big fuss is about this chick
If you want real music go listen to Metal or alt rock
Sorry I am just giving my honest analysis and opinion"
"Boring <SEP> This singer really sucks. He should not be singing. He should sing only at home , in the shower !!! hehehehe"
like song <SEP> downloaded song
"Mistake <SEP> Although I like TD Jake, I purchase this my mistake. It's just an intro which is about one minute long."
don't buy this if you want original sounds <SEP> NO STARS - terrible recording.
Catchy tune! <SEP> I remember this song from many years ago and enjoy listening to it sometimes.  Beware...it will stick in your head! :)
"not for me <SEP> I don't do ecstasy so this song isn't for me. Wish I'd read the ""remix"" part before I downloaded it."
Five Stars <SEP> 5 star all the way through!
Five Stars <SEP> Fabulous!
"Not what I was expecting <SEP> I purchased this song not realizing that it was a remix or alternate version. That was my own ignorance. However, when I decided to give it a chance, I was only further disappointed. I don't think it comes close to the orignial."
Rickys Best and hope to see him once more in concert. <SEP> Ricky's best music ever and he has never been shy about mentioning God in his music and his fans are glad of that.
Excellent! <SEP> Clear and simple. It is short. which make the suggestion be easily embedded in mind. That means you may need only a week if alter your perception by listening to it once a day? Depends on the meditator.
"Best Song by them <SEP> I loved the Men Who Built America, and when I realized that these guys were the ones who played the song, I had to have it."
Not even close to the same song that's played on intro to Men Who Built America <SEP> Nasty song.  I've already deleted it from my library.  Not even close to the same song that's played on intro to Men Who Built America
"I like it OK. <SEP> I bought this mainly for my brother to learn.  I like it alright, and Ricky sounds great.  If you're into this kind of music, you will like it."
"You Can't Hur Ham <SEP> Love Ricky Skaggs and just think this song, ""You can't Hurt Ham"" is so nice. Love it. Recommend to all who Love Ricky.
Ginny Gibson"
Buy the original. <SEP> I liked the original better.
"Not the Original <SEP> My fault for not reading the description - but beware of cover versions of songs, they are NOT the original version.

That said, this version is actually pretty well done."
"Its a mix <SEP> A great mix of both rhythmic and vocal synergy with decent enough length and feeling. Overall, (though seeing as I am knew to this artist) i feel they focus too much on feel over vocal potency. Though, again, I enjoy this very much. 5/5"
"Not what I was looking for <SEP> I was looking for the actual songs form the show, not computer generated music.  I've been very disappointed with every album I go to search for that this is the only stuff I can find."
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite Keane songs. Beautiful!
"Easy listening and evocative <SEP> This song opens with a moody lilting intro with a moody overlay of soft vocals. It then segues into a mellow, gentle cadence. Very nice vocals that combine with subtle but rewarding instrumentals. The song gradually ups the ante with a few key shifts which are both subtle and effective in building to a nice climax. Overall a very easy listening, but rewarding musical experience."
Smooth Country Folk <SEP> Smooth country folk music.  Lyrically oriented but not overboard.  Definitely music to sit back and listen to.  Enjoy.  Always aloha...
"Love this 45! <SEP> This is a surprisingly nice song. ""Sing"" went to a #3 on the charts, and this proves why. Though a simple song, it is clearly quite fitting for Karen's vocal as well as Richard's arrangement. ""Druscilla Penny,"" the flip side sung by Richard, is a rather strange song. I found it rather amusing at the end where it goes, ""Could you ever really love, ever really care, ever really get it together? No, no.."" Hopefully there was never a real Druscilla Penny!"
Five Stars <SEP> Very nice thank you
"Great Song <SEP> The song is meaningful and fun.  It definitely has Group 1 Crew style, meaning that Group 1 Crew didn't deviate from their style in order to fit a traditional Christmas mold.  Yet, the beat & melodies still have a seasonal sense throughout."
Odd <SEP> Never ordered or got
"Sent a record <SEP> This was a terrible experience that I cannot play it. This is a vinyl record. I cannot play it or convert it. If anyone could help me on it I would appreciate it!

I ordered a CD and got a Record Album

Five Stars <SEP> Excellent album. All the songs are a hit. Especially Papparazzi. That one particularly rocks!
"Finding This 1976 R&B Charter  On CD Is Difficult <SEP> Those seeking the 6 hit instrumental singles registered by Hugh Masekela in North America from 1967 to 1984 have to be frustrated as soon as they take a look at the contents of those purporting to be his ""best"" or ""greatest, likely thinking that they should at least include those 6 sides. But so far it hasn't worked out that way. Take, for example, the 2001 release from Sony titled Grazing In The Grass: The Best of Hugh Masekela, or his entry in the massive 20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection that started to appear about 20 years ago.

I'm NOT knocking the contents of either one, as the music of Hugh Masekela speaks for itself, whether a hit single or not, but given the fact he only had four Pop hit singles from 1967 to 1969, along with two others that scored only on the R&B charts, one in 1978 and the other in 1984, would it not reasonably be expected that a compilation so titled would at least include ALL of those? And in their original format? Those two do not.

In both you get what turned out to be his best single of the six, 1968's Grazing In The Grass, which made it to # 1 on both the Billboard Pop Hot 100 and R&B charts, and # 15 Adult Contemporary in June/July on Uni 55066, but only the Millenium disc has the B-side, Bajabula Bonke (The Healing Song). That one also has his first hit, Up-Up And Away, a # 47 R&B and # 71 Hot 100 in January 1968 on Uni 55037, and his fourth, Riot, which ended up at # 21 R&B/# 55 Hot 100 in February 1969 on Uni 5512, which do not appear in th Sony release. It, however, does contain his July 1984 # 67 R&B Don't Go Lose It Baby, which came out on Jive Africa 9193 (the flip was the same song with a dubbed in mix).

Neither contains the uncharted B-sides of Up-Up And Away and Riot - Son Of Ice Bag and Mace And Grenades - nor does either have his third hit, Puffin' On Down The Track, a # 71 Hot 100 in October 1968 on Uni55085 and its flipside, Do Me So La So So, currently available only in 45 rpm format, and the 1978 hit he shared with Herb Alpert, a cover of the 1954 hit by Ralph Marterie, Skokiaan, which finished at # 87 R&B in May on Horizon 115 and its B-side, African Summer. That's the 45 rpm you see here, and both sides also appear in the 1990 A&M CD Herb Alpert & Hugh Masekla, but it's now only available in used format and at exorbitant prices.

If you like the musical styling of Hugh Masekela and don't really care one way or the other that these may not be original hit single renditions, or even representative of his best, then by all means go for it. As I said, there is nothing wrong with the music in and of itself. But if by his ""best"" you are expecting all his hits stay well clear because both are false advertising by any definition."
"One Star <SEP> I cannot find this anywhere, but it shows that I bought it??"
There nothing like great southern soul music to sit back and enjoy <SEP> There nothing  like  great  southern  soul  music  to sit back and enjoy
"This is an excellent a capella rendition of Sweet Beulah Land <SEP> This is an excellent a capella rendition of Sweet Beulah Land.  It's tender, heartfelt, and soulful.  It makes you want to close your eyes and look toward Heaven.  The Carolina Boys sang it beautifully."
Five Stars <SEP> Metal!
Two Stars <SEP> ok
Great Christian Christmas Music <SEP> Great Music
Awesome song <SEP> This first time I heard this song I fell in love with it. Couldn't wait to find it and download it
"Subpar album, well priced <SEP> Music: Himesh Reshammiya

1. Kabhi Kabhi Mere Dil Mein Ye Sawaal Aata Hai (Funk) --------------------------- 6/10
2. Kabhi Kabhi Mere Dil Mein Ye Sawaal (Trance) --------------------------------------- 6/10
Normally, Ajay Devgn (it pains me to spell his name with the missing vowel), falls flat with his punchlines and in-song dialogues, this monologue put to tune is fairly good. The lyrics are funny, but when listening to the first dialogue, it feels, it should have been 'Daughter Of Sardaar' and not the son. Some of the techno elements in the Trance version are pretty slick, but the original remains the better of the two.

3. Bichdann -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/10
A classic HR  une of a yearning/broken heart. The style is fairly similar to Aap Ka Suroor album. In his heydays, HR would have himself sung it, but Rahat  Fateh Ali Khan fits well too. His fans might like it.

Final verdict: In an album of 11 tracks, only 3 get a mention. That goes to show how Himesh's stock has taken a plunge. Probably, he should playback his own songs again. Probably."
I'm really disappointed. The music is what I expected but it's ... <SEP> I'm really disappointed. The music is what I expected but it's only 27 seconds and it just ends abruptly.
"Only a part of the song. <SEP> Should have read the only other review - this is NOT a complete version of the song.  You get about 1/2 through and suddenly the track ends.  What a waste of money!  I downloaded it, listened once, and promptly deleted it from my library.  If it's not the complete song, it doesn't do me any good."
Good! <SEP> Good!
Skip in file <SEP> This mp3 has a skip about half way through. It should be reviewed by amazon and removed or resubmitted. And I'd like my 89 cents back please.
Got old <SEP> It old and got sick of it fast
this song works <SEP> dig the Police/Reggae  influence and Bruno Mars is the truth musically. He truly is versatile and multi talented and is going to be a force to be reckon with for many years to come. and this  song live goes even harder as evident by him and his  band's grammy performance. something about that performance turned it around for me about him as a  Solo Artist and I've been  on it every since.  he is Artist where I feel the best is yet to come.
"Awesome <SEP> After seeing Faith on the CMA's this year am ready for a new album.
This song after her hiatis from the charts for awhile reminds me why
I fell in love with her music in the first place."
"Beautiful pianism <SEP> CONTENTS: Dumka, op. 59; Six Morceaux, op. 19; Deux Morceaux, op. 10; Grand Sonata in G Major, op. 37.
While not among Tchaikovsky's greatest works, his music for solo piano contains much that is attractive and at times quite beautiful. The Russian-American pianist Dmitry Rachmanov obviously loves this music, as is shown in his performances here. Rachmanov can make a melody sing, and his lyrical phrasing, with its frequent use of subito piano and subito pianissimo, can be ravishing. He is less successful, however, in Tchaikovsky's generally-bombastic Piano Sonata. Rachmanov keeps the music moving ahead and wonderfully transparent, but this work also cries out (especially in its frequent moments of vulgarity) for greater spaciousness, pedal and volume! Rachmanov's beautiful pianism is much to be admired, and I highly recommend this disc. Excellent recorded sound."
unable to hear <SEP> I have not yet heard my download I purchased through Amazon because the extension is .amz. I do not know how to convert this to MP3 so it just sits there not being heard. Amazon does a horrible job of instructing a person how to convert these and I have just accepted that I wasted my money on this.
Five Stars <SEP> You go Donald Fagen
"Stolen Song <SEP> This was purchased as Royalty Free then Flagged by YouTube as Dreamy Ride-atsm, musical composition administered by AdRev Publishing.

NOT ROYALTY FREE! Should be removed!"
Awesome!!! <SEP> I been waiting to find this crystal clear and smooth without vinyle pops and cassette hiss so i was very pleased.
Great up and coming band <SEP> If you love classic rock this new band will bring you back. Great edge to their music.  Had the chance to meet them and they are also a great group of guys on top of the rockin' music!
Five Stars <SEP> Classic Steely Dan - the music is timeless!
"Amazon:  Restore the ORIGINAL version of this Fine song! <SEP> This version of I.G.Y. has been hard-limited so that all the dynamics are gone!

Upload at least from the original CD so we can hear the original sound!!"
"Buyer beware: bootleg from Russia, not authorized by the band <SEP> Music: 5 stars; Sequencing: 1 star; New relevance/Legitimacy: 0 stars

Any true Kraftwerk fan knows that the band would NEVER agree to this type of bland 'greatest hits' release. The closest we will ever come to an official greatest hits album was released as the 2005 live album ""Minimum Maximum"". Unfortunately I've seen these types of unofficial Kraftwerk releases on a number of occasions. In the early 90s, I stumbled upon a collection called ""The Model"", which if I recall originated from France. It was basically a one-disc greatest hits (covering the Radio Activity, Trans Europe Express, and the Man Machine albums). Then there was the mid-90s collection out of Japan called ""Best of Kraftwerk"", which is even worse (only 9 songs). Now we get this.

""Greatest Hits"" (2 CDs; 29 tracks) is a curious compilation that is heavy on the latter day output, with no less than 7 tracks from ""Tour de France Soundtracks"" (in contrast, only 1 song from ""Radioactivity"" and none from ""Autobahn"", although it does have the title track's live version from ""Minimum Maximum""). Also please note that there isn't a single note on this compilation that is ""new"" music: all of it has been previously released. Perhaps the most redeeming inclusion on here is the ""Expo 2000"" single (I remember when that came out, I bought it immediately, both the original single and the remix single, as I was sure this would become a hard to find CD single down the road). The sequencing of the 29 tracks on here makes little or no sense. It's as if someone put 29 song names in a hat and then pulled them back out one by one. That said, it is obvious that there is a ton of great music on here, but let me re-emphasize that this is an unauthorized release from Russia that does not in any way, shape or form have the blessing from Kraftwerk. This was released by the same Russian company that released last year's 2CD ""Greatest Hits"" compilation of Coldplay (also unauthorized of course). Buyer beware.

"Awesome1 <SEP> Great song about the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Love the vocals, instrumentation and arrangement of the studio version."
I have enjoyed listening to Solo Piano music for a few years ... <SEP> I have enjoyed listening to Solo Piano music for a few years now.  I love the soothing Christmas music performed by different artists -- wish I could play like that!!
Great relaxing Christmas music <SEP> Great relaxing Christmas music.
"Beautiful music <SEP> Beautiful music  ---- what else can I say? Some soft and soothing, some  lively. I can easily listen to his piano artist all day."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent quality and a great voice. Gives a better understanding of the book of the law
Five Stars <SEP> Great worship song!
ILLEGAL COPY - DONT BUY <SEP> This isn't a Dani Wilde CD - It's being sold by some fraud  - it is illegal and should be removed.
great song <SEP> used the song in a video. It worked very well. Great piano part and buildup of the instruments and vocals to the chorus. Some parts of the song are not as clear to understand the words but I looked them up.
love this song <SEP> Beautiful.  I could listen to this over and over again.
Two Stars <SEP> I could NOT relax to his voice and meditate! Maybe someone else would.
A mistake <SEP> I wanted the original artist of this song not the imitation. When I tried to remedy the situation I found I could not contact anyone concerning reimbursement. So I am stuck with it on my Cloud.
I was really looking forward to this CD.... <SEP> I was a big fan of This Day and Age and was excited to hear Jeff Martin was continuing to make music with a new band.  I liked his half of the Jeff Martin/Steve Padin CD that they put out a couple years ago a lot and was hoping the momentum would continue through.  This album has been a let down to me.  Everything else he's ever done has made its way into heavy rotation on my MP3 player this one just hasn't stuck with me the same way.
One Star <SEP> big mistake buying this song.
"Hear I NEED YOU NOW! <SEP> If you haven't heard the song on this CD, I Need You Now, you must hear it.  This CD is wonderful!"
Need Jesus...NOW? <SEP> So true!  I NEED JESUS NOW!!!  Do you?  Plumb sings from her heart!
"excellent <SEP> at his best, pairings are superb."
Five Stars <SEP> Duet with Susan Boyle stands out - superb
Five Stars <SEP> Love Placido!!!
"Pretty amazing, guys. <SEP> I first heard this album in my sister's car. I used to hate my sister, but after she went off to college, we got along much better. Anyway, she was home during one of her breaks, and we were driving to town to get some candy and movies, and she played this album. In my understanding, she bought it off the guy that sings it after one of his shows.

And guys, I know I said this in the title, but it's pretty amazing.

I'm a lyrics girl, so I can't listen to things if the lyrics are shallow or in any way terrible, but that has not been a problem with this album. Awesome words abound.

I'm a senior in college now, so I've been listening to this sucker for awhile. Actually, I got it straight from my sister. Burned it, you know. So terrible. But there was no place for me to buy it at the time. I came on to Amazon looking for new music tonight and thought I'd check to see if this guy had written anything new. I guess not, but at least I'll buy this album to make my possession of it legitimate.

Anyway, I don't talk about music much, so I don't have fancy ways for describing why I like this album. It's just worthwhile, and I thought it deserved a review."
"Were sorry but this selection is currently not available. What? <SEP> Purchased it and it says  ""You purchased this song on May 2, 2018"" but when I click Listen to it, it takes me over to the music.amazon.com page and says this....... Were sorry but this selection is currently not available. I see it finally came through with my receipt something like 3 HOURS LATER. What? A digital purchase takes THAT LONG to transact. I did not log on until the next day after checking for 2 hours or more for the download. Rediculous. Also, the SKYFALL recording sounds muffled compared to other digital music on my Amazon music library. I would not buy it unless you really have no choice, kind of like I did, because I really wanted the Adele Skyfall recording."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this!
"Angelic and Heavy <SEP> When listening to the samples it didn't give me all that I wanted, but enough so I bought it. Holy Lord Almighty AWESOME! I'm not going to compare them to this artist or that because not everyone likes this or that, or at lease not just yet. As one who loves banging my head with my hands high in the air, I couldn't get over the angelic female vocals, and the male vocals just Gothic and had a growl here and there that got me really pumped.  This album and band just know how to make you think lyrically, and it fills you with just joy and a head bang. I found myself replaying the album again, and normally I would go on with another album, but this was so AWESOME I had to play it a couple more times. I can see one or more of these songs in an action scene in a movie. If you like this or that (Evanescence, Within Temptation) get it. But check out the samples you just might get hooked enough to buy this and have a good time listening to it repeatedly."
"awesome, just awesome. <SEP> the song is almost as awesome as Danny Sexbang. if i where to rate this song on a scale of one to five, i would turn it up to an eleven."
"having grown up with the originals I was disappointed! Expected original artists but they aren't <SEP> having grown up with the originals I was disappointed ! Expected original artists but they aren't. Many of the ""renditions"" irritated me no end - tempos off, inflections off and artists addition of their own interpretations. Not a good buy if you are looking for true 50 & 60's music. Pass on this one and try to find original artists CD. CD packaging makes it look like original artists - maybe a few are."
Great buy!!! <SEP> Great collection of oldies in a very unique package at abgrat price make an unbelievable combination.
"Don't waste your money on this one. <SEP> This was a HUGE disappointment.  I took it for granted, unfortunately, that the songs were being sung by the ORIGINAL artists.  What a surprise when I began listening today.  Terrible singers and not noting by Amazon that these are not the original artists was a real surprise to me.  I have been purchasing items from AMAZON for a long time and have been satisfied.  I am going to just throw them in the garbage and not have to deal with the return and the shipping.  Huge Disappointment Amazon!!!!!  I didn't even want to give it one star but if I cleared the star, my review disappeared."
"Save your money! <SEP> Save your money! Very disappointed in this product ... Some of these artists should not be singing professionally .. Nothing like the typical ""oldies"" products out there ... I plan on returning it..."
"Disappointment <SEP> I am very disappointed. My husband and I have replaced almost all of our vinyl LPs with cds and have been very successful. I have also purchased many other oldie compilations. I am very careful to read to make sure they our by the original artists. Unless I missed something, these are not the original recordings. They sound horrible once you know and have listened to these songs for years. It might be later remakes of the originals by their artists but they are not the same. I did not read anything about that either. This has only happened twice when I have ordered and I have ordered a lot. I am really concerned about trying it again after this."
good song <SEP> Remembering the people that risk their lives for us.
firefighter song <SEP> Its great song about firefighting and a great tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice doing what they love. It expresses the real dedication it takes to be  firefighter and the what we do.
"awesome <SEP> this is an awesome cd! Dark, mysterious in a kind of drawn out horror film atmosphere with rock over it. It's everything you'd come to know about Suicide Ali. If you new I suggest looking up a song or two on you tube, then buying the mps3, which is an awesome deal seeing how the cd is about $35 and has to be imported."
Foiled Expectations <SEP> Very disappointed.  We had the full album when I was a child and was expecting that.  This was just a 45rpm of one song.  Way to expensive for what it turned out to be.
Best techno track since a while now! period!!! <SEP> The subject line say it all! Tamer Is one of the finest Techno producers around!!! Take a bow master!!!! CHeers
"30 second clip not enough! <SEP> ""I want you to want me"" is a classic Cheap Trick Song. But here is too much introduction not related to the song and too much left over baggage after the song is finished. I was disappointed in the song and would not recommend it unless you have editing software to take out the first and last part of the recording. If you have a playlist of Christmas songs you can dance to, this recording as is, probably would not work (a few more lines of original Christmas lyrics would have probably helped too)."
"The Scrooge Take on this Monstrosity <SEP> This comes pre-parodied in ""Love, Actually,"" with Bill Nighy playing the part of Robin Zander.

Okay, I know, I'm very churlish since this is a charity album.  I still hate the whole idea of Cheap Trick redoing this song as a Christmas ditty."
Love Lothlorien! <SEP> I came across this group along time ago and remembered about them recently and wanted to listen to their music again. I was very happy to see Amazon had them in MP3 format. I love the way they play and sing these songs.
Five Stars <SEP> Great album by a great new artist!
Five Stars <SEP> I loved it
"Disappointing <SEP> I was very disappointed with this soundtrack and would recommend not purchasing.  The main title was okay but the rest of the soundtrack was mostly a bunch of strange & irritating, non melodic sounds."
Two Stars <SEP> Not 100 hits. Only 50
"You Really Should Check This Album Out! <SEP> I'm all about this album right now! If you're at all a fan of James Taylor, Elvis Costello, or David Wilcox- you're gonna really dig this! I found out about the album on Middle Tennessee Music blog where they reviewed the album. The review got me interested and now I'm hooked! Check out the review for yourself at [...] and check out this guy's music!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great
Great music for toddlers from Brazil <SEP> My soon to be 2-year old grandsons love this!  My wife and daughter find themselves humming and singing these tunes even when the music is not on.
My favorite song!! <SEP> I have always loved Christmas music and I have to say that this song is one of my favorites.  Scotty McCreery does a great job with this song.
Five Stars <SEP> I really love this song! This lady can really jam & great vocals! Well worth the money!
One Star <SEP> I don't need it.
Slightly disappointed <SEP> Quite a few of the tracks won't play or skip. Ive tried the disc in multiple players with the same results.
The Mood Setter for 50 Shades of Grey! <SEP> When I listened to this song for the first time it gave me the impression of how the emotions of the book 50 Shades of Grey seemed almost like a storm. For me this song took me through the ups and downs of this series and really was a great tool when capturing the mood of the book chapters as I went through the books.
Great choice <SEP> Love this song.
kj's review <SEP> Love this song!  Love her singing!  Saw her at Lake Mission Viejo this summer and it was one of the best concerts of the summer! Thank you!
Great sound <SEP> This has quickly become one of my favorite songs.
"McDreamy, McSteamy...McCountry!!!! <SEP> He is crazy talented but a down to earth future legendary country music star.  I voted for him from the start for American Idol."
Love all of it....especially music! <SEP> Great products!  I never hesitate to order anything on Amazon.  I'm always pleased.  Will order more music when I can.
"Mary did you know? <SEP> I Didn't like this CD ,I wasn't crazy about any of the songs he selected to sing .I was very disappointed."
bubble gum <SEP> I got this for an 8 year old who wants to perform it. It is not my taste at all
Messy Jessie <SEP> I downloaded this song for my one year old daughter. She dances when she hearts it.  It's not worth 1.29. The full version uses so much auto tune it pierces your ears.
Five Stars <SEP> Thank You
Loved it <SEP> Great song!
"I like the song but the sound quality is really crappy. <SEP> I was immediately taken with this song and really do love it, but the mp3 sound quality makes it un-listenable. I wound up purchasing the MP3 twice thinking that I had somehow bought a pirate copy the first go round. No, your earbud's speakers are not blown out, the recording is bad."
Five Stars <SEP> I love to dance Casino when this song is played. One of my favorite songs. Yes Indeed.
"Original Ole Miss Dixie Before Political Correctness Took Over Academia <SEP> This is the original ""Dixie"" fight song played by the Ole Miss band until the less racially offensive ""From Dixie With Love"" took over, inserting a watered down version of the old fight song complete with strains of the Battle Hymn of the Republic inserted into the middle of it to ""offend no yankee ears"". You can tell the difference because of the bugle call at the first bars, a call that was indicative of not the jazzy Dixie that you usually hear, but the ""march"" Dixie you hardly can ever find or hear. The ""march"" version of Dixie is a stirring, patriotic song of the Old South, and not a jazz tune off the streets of New Orleans, Memphis or St. Louis (Although, it is recognized that the first tune written by Dix was a jazz song.) The original Ole Miss fight song ""Dixie"" that you hear here is actually the version that begins with ""To arms! To arms! To arms in Dixie"", which was the version that was the anthem of the Confederate States of America. This is probably the only version that is on the net that can be found today, although it may be out there somewhere."
"Terrible album. <SEP> Terrible musicianship, recording quality, song selection. Nothing redeeming about this album. Deceptive reviews. Don't buy it. Unpleasant surprise for you."
Horrible Wannabe Remake. <SEP> I didn't relize that this wasn't the actual GG song but instead some bad remake. I thought that it was a compilation cd because I was new to kpop. Silly me! Save your money and get the real version! Sounds kind of like cats screeching instead of singing.
"I like the song, but this is just a cover <SEP> This K-pop song is originally sung by Korean girl-group 2NE1.  The song is great and when sung by the original artist, I would have given 5 stars.  However, this is a just a cover.  Though the one who covers sings well, there's NO comparison to 2NE1 and loses that zany oomph.  Look for 2NE1 sung song, instead."
"I thought it would be a full song, not 17 seconds long. <SEP> I ordered this for my girlfriend who is a huge Alabama fan and was totally disappointed since it only lasted 17 seconds for 89 cents. Seriously, don't waste your money."
"too short <SEP> I bought this track thinking it was exactly like the one found on the Jock Rock album, but this track is way to short. Less than a minute short."
"easter memories <SEP> Rolf Zuckowski writes wonderful music for children. It is really fun to sing along with them.
Only problem we had that these songs are ear-worms - you can not get rid of the melody in your head"
Not Sung By Stars <SEP> I don't know what this crap is but it's not being sung by the kpop stars who originally sing these songs. Very disappointing and weird.
Two Stars <SEP> This is only 23 seconds.
One Star <SEP> Just a tease. Not the full intro....
23 sec long <SEP> The intro starts out ok but ends in 23 sec.  It is the same length as the free demo. As a Bulls season ticket holder I can assure you this is not the entire theme song.  Do not download a total ripoff.
"Casebolt plays Schubert:  Refreshing <SEP> As with all of Ms. Casebolt's performances, I found her performances of these four Schubert Impromptus to be enjoyable and refreshing. What was especially refreshing was that Ms. Casebolt, whose childhood love of the piano has endured over many many years, played these pieces without pretense or aspiring to studio perfection. It's as though the listener is sitting in her living room with her as she plays just for the sheer joy of it, retaining all the flubs to ensure ""neurotic authenticity.""  For my money, her performance was authentic enough.

Rather than listening to each Impromptu as an individual piece, I advise the listener to instead listen to all four Impromptus without pause as though they are individual movements in a total work, allowing them to create an overall mood for the listener. Grab some scotch, imagine you are sitting in her living room, and enjoy.

Richard Althouse"

"The Disappoinments says it all <SEP> There's a reason this is by The Disappoinments, because it is, to say the least, disappointing to listen to. You'd be as well off making a recording of your latest bathroom break."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful!
One Star <SEP> Not the effect I wanted and poor quality
"Amazing and moving music <SEP> This piece was an amazing example of what Ah Nee Mah can do, especially with their use of guitar and the Native American flute.  It manages to feel both modern and ancient and I feel like I'm being transported to a different place and century when I listen to it while driving.  Exposure to Native music and culture really should be part of the American educational curriculum."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful song. Part of my Sunday Morning Ride playlist.
"Inspirational! <SEP> If you want to walk in the Spirit all day long, start your day listening to BY FAITH and IN CHRIST ALONE! It brings me to tears every time."
"Disappointment <SEP> I thought this was a cute and unique item for my niece until I read the detailed product description. If they can't get the description correct, I don't have faith in the customization of the product.

""See our FAQ and Custom Help Pages for unusually names ..."""
"Music recorded in concerts sucks! <SEP> A real disappointment but it's my fault: I hate music recorded in concerts because the quality is always mediocre, plus many times they don't have the same length and words. This is exactly that! I like their music but hate the format."
"Don't miss out on this wonderful pop duo. <SEP> I first heard Icona Pop's ""I Love It"" back in late 2012 when it was about to seriously hit the airwaves.  I ordered this EP from Amazon a while back, even though I knew it was just 6 tracks.  But hey, I wanted a good taste of their music before their proper LP, ""This Is Icona Pop"", would be released a year later.  The title track is still very catchy, but some of the other songs deserve attention too.  My 2 other favorites here are ""Ready For The Weekend"" (sadly, the song is much too short at just 2 minutes) and ""Good For You.""  The last song is the only one I didn't like, but that is only from my personal taste.

I also had the pleasure of watching Icona Pop on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2013 just a week ago.  I can't believe how great they sounded live!!  I really hope that this duo catches some more fire (figuratively speaking, people!!) and releases another LP by year's end.  It would also be nice if they performed live in the States more often."
Music hard to understand <SEP> You could barely understand what they were staying in there songs.  On the radio I have to problem understanding them.
Five Stars <SEP> This is a great song! Use it at church too!
OK for kids <SEP> Not my style
kids <SEP> Not my style
Two Stars <SEP> Never ended up using it.
LOVE IT!!!! <SEP> Classic Ty Segall!!!! Enough Said!
One of the BEST Christmas songs ever! <SEP> Buy this! You won't regret it. This is such a beautiful Christmas song! It is so nice! It is one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again because it is that nice!
Five Stars <SEP> Great music straight from Scripture
Beautifully done. This song gave me in the Christmas ... <SEP> Beautifully  done.  This song gave me in the  Christmas Spirit.
"yawnners <SEP> i purchased just one song, ''have yourself a merry little christmas'' which most artists seem to fill with emotion but this lady antebellum version does not ring true."
"classic sound that makes me happy and has a lot of heart <SEP> I always listen to this album when I'm driving, really a simple, classic sound that makes me happy and has a lot of heart."
Sucks...don't buy it. <SEP> Incomplete lessons...they don't even tell you what they are saying in English.
"Absolutely Beautiful! <SEP> Not only is this song a heart pulling story, but the vocals are soothing and powerful at the same time. It's a top 10 on my playlist."
"It is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and not worth the money because <SEP> All the songs are the ones we have heard many many times before. I think that they simply changed the background accompaniment. It is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and not worth the money because, as Waylon fans,  we already have all the songs in their original version."
"Not original <SEP> This is a midi version! Don't buy it if you want the original! I wish I had read the other review before I wasted my promotional freight on this (silly me)- but at least I didn't spend ""real"" money."
"Not the real thing <SEP> Not the real song.  Do not buy, is a crappy midi fake. Is not what I was looking for and the album art is intentionally misleading."
Don't. <SEP> A poor version of a great piece.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Five Stars <SEP> Was exactly what i was expecting.
"Dissapointed <SEP> Nothing wrong with the song, but my husband was not able to use it because it is protected.  He wanted to use it on his Yamaha keyboard but couldn't."
Two Stars <SEP> record was warped not worth sending back.
"Wonderful tunes <SEP> This is one of those albums where you can listen to over and over again. Some of the songs are catchy and energetic, other songs make me pause and reflect.

Great work."
One Star <SEP> Horrible
Five Stars <SEP> GREAT SOUND.
"Can't go wrong! <SEP> I love the nitty gritty sound to this album, a must for any true die hard Black Keys fans, I love it!"
"Too similar to the album versions <SEP> The songs are great, but they are too similar to the album versions to make this worth buying. I would have liked to see versions with more energy or slightly different takes on the original. If these were from a live show instead of just a rehearsal it might have been better."
"Nashville, get ready for your next big star! <SEP> Kelleigh is simply amazing. She is a beautiful person with a beautiful voice! I can't wait for the whole album to become available!"
dont remember buying this album <SEP> i don't remember buying this mp3 album. can you let me know when this purchase occured? Someone may have stolen my card!
great song <SEP> THIS WAS A GREAT SONG AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREE IS A GREAT PLUS I FREE STUFF IS GOOD
"I would order from a vendor that treats their vinyl better. Musically <SEP> My copy of the picture disc came covered in skips and sueface inperfections. I would order from a vendor that treats their vinyl better. Musically, an amazing album. Product delivered leaves everything to be disired."
"Awesome <SEP> Awesome.  Full of awesome wrapped in awesome pants, swaddled in an awesome swaddling cloth, and topped with awesome sauce.  Blah."
"Nothing like being immersed in other cultures' music - enriching <SEP> Nothing like being immersed in other cultures' music - enriching, enveloping in mini-vacations!  I play this so often I hum with the tunes even though I have no clue to the languages!"
"It's NOT instrumental.  There are vocals. <SEP> It's not instrumental.  There are vocals, even though the album is entitled ""Instrumental Gold"".  This is not a karaoke track."
"Happy Halloween! <SEP> I met Buch Patrick and he sold me a CD, which only had this one song on it. The song is not that good. It's corny and dumb. Not nearly as food as ""Whatever Happened To Eddie?"". Well, at least he signed the CD for me. That's something."

"Oops, wrong planet! <SEP> This is what used to be known as musak. Just not my cup of tea. I accidentally bought it thinking it was about ""The Dog Whisperer"", Cesar Millan."
"So far I have found this to be very helpful ... <SEP> So far I have found this to be very helpful with improving my mood, and my outlook on life.  When my thyroid issue is resolved I will come back and give it 5 stars!"
"Needs softer delivery <SEP> I like the concept but would prefer a female voice to narrate. The male voice is annoying and sounds demanding. I.e. do this, do that, take your shoes off...etc."
"Sharp Flute Spoils It! <SEP> Not happy with this cut at all. If I could get my money back and buy a new track with it, I would. What a waste of 99 cents."
One Star <SEP> It's another version of the song. Beware.
One Star <SEP> cd does not work.  Have return twice
"very disappointed.. <SEP> Actually no, the double disk album I purchased only one of the disks play, the other is empty.. very disappointed  .."
Amy Winehouse never disappoints <SEP> love amy winehouse and this was a big hit with my mom who I gave it to...
Poor quality <SEP> The second Disk had nothing on it-was missing songs.
"SO muffin good! <SEP> Wow, what can i say! These songs are instant classics and absolute L-O-L funny! The perfect gift for any occasion, I can even listen to these jams in November. The lead singer's voice is silk, I'd definitely recommend this collection."
Yet Another Great One from Steve Pettit <SEP> Before You Now is yet another production from Steve Pettit that I never tire of listening to. Their music is refreshing and uplifting. The Steve Pettit team is a group of talented musicians and singers who are using their gifts in a glorifying way. I would recommend all of the Pettit teams albums.
"Fantastic album <SEP> As always, Steve Pettit et al deliver beautifully! Definitely some of my favorite songs by them so far :) worth the money!"
Didn't work for me <SEP> Maybe it will work for you but it didn't for me. sounds pretty but I did not get the desired results. Some hotel chain I stayed at had a better one -- wish I had it.
Disappointed <SEP> This album just doesn't have the sound or wit that I'd come to expect from Dick Valentine. I wish that I had not purchased it.
Go to KungFuVampire.com <SEP> If you want to support the artist directly and get the real CD not this reprint. Order directly through Kung Fu Vampire on his site kungfuvampire.com
"Great Genuine Non-Glossy Country <SEP> Great album! Good alt-country sound without being overly folksy or over-produced. Autry's music really speaks to the rural Southern experience, leaving it, and looking back and forward. Great collection of songs that tug at the emotions."
Good solid song <SEP> I haven't heard Jon for a while & this was true to his musical talent that I enjoyed with his self titled debut album 21 years ago.
Rap crap! <SEP> If you want a rap cd that every song sounds the same this is the one. Every single song on here sounds like the one before. I'm not a big rap fan but there are some that I like ok. This was not one of them. Paul Wall may be ok as a rapper but he blowed this one big time.
"don't like it <SEP> sounds like a mix tape beats out of memphis,tn does not sound good the beats are good for a mix tape rapper but not for paul wall style the two just doesnt sound good together this is just my opionion"
"Album is pathetic, and I rarely use this term when subjectivity is involved <SEP> PRODUCTION: 3/8
LYRICS: 3/8
CONTENT: 2/8
ENJOYMENT: 2/8

There is no way I can justify listening to this album in anyway: the production is subpar, there is no variety, and the whole thing sounds the same.  The production is solely handled by GL Productions, delivering a typical Southern sound with heavy bass and quick hi hats, but practically every beat as similar elements and literally sounds like one big track.  The repetitiveness is astoundingly annoying.  This is accompanied by Paul Wall's weak lyrical ability, uninteresting flow, lack of creativity, and lack of any relevant content.  And every song does not need a GL Production tag, it is worse than DJ Fresh...DJ Fresh...DJ Fresh.  Album is pathetic, and I rarely use this term when subjectivity is involved."
very pleasant sound <SEP> I have enjoyed listening to this piece many times. I am a Mulla Sadra fan much fascinated with his transcendent theosophy. The music brings it to life.
"Goofed purchase <SEP> Bought this by accident thinking it was another song. While it's catchy, rap just isn't my thing. I can see it being big in a club, however."
One Star <SEP> Didn't order.
I Will definitely recommend and order again <SEP> Fast getting here! I Will definitely recommend and order again! Thank you guys!!!!
ROY WILL BRING  IT ! <SEP> ROY FIELDS  BRINGS YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF THE  LORD ! HE WAS AT OUR CHURCH  & THE GLORY OF THE LORD WAS THERE GREAT CDS ALL OF THEM !
"Two-thirds of the verse material available was disregarded. <SEP> The arrangement is beautiful, and the words are well sung.  I quite enjoyed listening to this music.  But what the 30-second sample does not reveal is that Starfield chose to ignore the second and third verses of this carol and instead simply repeated the better-known first verse."
"Gotta love Paw <SEP> Paw was one of the best, if mostly unheard of,  groups from 90's rock/alt rock scene. My opinion only but what else would you expect from someone willing to pay for their music? Give them a shot - you might become a fan yourself."
"good album <SEP> Starfield is one of my favorite bands, so I'm a little biased.  I thought this was a good Christmas album.  It's very ""Starfield-y"" too.  I would have preferred a few more songs to round it out, especially some original tunes."
"Another fantastic track by Dimie Cat <SEP> Sexy and fun, French and playful!"
"Love this song <SEP> this is a big tune, and lady saw is he song is sexy, as always the queen of dancehall. The song is sexy and raunchy in other words perfect"
Two Stars <SEP> It alright. I was looking for the original version.
lovvvve <SEP> If you lke Lady Saw you will love this song. - even the rated R version.  Her music is great
"Love it <SEP> Another Penthouse classic that will be around for generations to come. I suggest you add this to your collection, you will not be disappointed."
Five Stars <SEP> One of favs.
Great Blues Collection <SEP> The songs are very uplifting; energizing.  Makes me want to go out and drink; sort of.  Some great songs by some big name blues stars.
"Ask Santa for some ear plugs <SEP> Home for Christmas.  Sounds innocent enough.  But you would be well advised to stay away from this home.  It is a horrible place.  You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd.  Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate.  How bad is it?  Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo.  It had them babbling like babies in minutes.  But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must.  After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!"
Lifeless. <SEP> lifeless rendition of a beautiful piece.
dont buy this song <SEP> Worst cover ever. The singer performance is horrible. There is no way to enjoy this song. LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL BUNFUNK SONG.
MORE LIKE BOYS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!! <SEP> SUCH A BIG JOKE. Who actually thought this would work? This song is a snore and hurts my ears. Boys will be boys? More like Boys will be disappointed and CRY!
"Wonderful Young Comedic Talent! <SEP> Adomian has boundless energy and a genuine wit about him. He is truly a neverending joy to listen to. I've heard all of his Comedy Bang Bang appearances and most all you can find on YouTube and he never is repetitive or stale.

I admire his fast mind and envy how tip top and sharp he can be!

You will enjoy this CD and we can all look forward to James' promising comedic career!"
Top ten hit <SEP> Great song great beat great word play and delivery if this guy keeps at it a deal is not to far away
DON'T LIKE IT MUCH <SEP> Totally tasteless and brainless like the old lady that sings it. Sorry I took the time to listen to it.
Happy <SEP> Great way to get music
i am kept by jesus <SEP> i grew up singing this song in my old church home as its' pianist and director. it is brautiful and touches my soul deeply.
Five Stars <SEP> Real NY Hip-Hop of the rarest variety!
"awesome <SEP> Its poppy, catchy, and its got young and in love lyrics. if you like any of those things than check it out."
amazing <SEP> I've been playing these musical downloads in the background during counseling sessions at work and my patients love them. They make me feel more productive at work as well.
Five Stars <SEP> I came back for more but there wasn't any
Great song <SEP> I love this song! My granddaughter heard it on a moving when they where rolling the credit on tv she song the whole song she only five years old!
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
"One of the the best songs 2013... ? <SEP> As the subject header says this was one of the catchiest, fun & such an eclectic mixtures of musicale styles... So my question is ""where and when will there be a full album released?"" I really hope it wasn't just a one off deal. Because anyone who knows and loves music, especially  those magical moments that would strike certain parts of the world from London to Detroit and NY and Seattle (both times, late '50s-'60s garage bands then the over hyped grunge) there has been precious little worth getting excited about. Nothing but tame assembly Line pre packaged crapola  
It's time music got dangerous again, scarred your parents  and had something to say about the mess we egomaniacs w/ inferiority complexes have pushed this planet OUR HOME to the brink along with every other living thing be it plant or animal... ""Dance to the beat of the living dead loose sleep baby and stay away from bed"""
"Sweethearts of the Rodeo are Back !! <SEP> I absolutely love these ladies, so I was thrilled to see they have made a new CD.  I had the privilege of meeting them in person at a concert in Torrance, CA, back around 1995.  Their beautiful, ringing harmonies and upbeat energy drew me to their songs back then (such as Midnight Girl in a Sunset Town, Blue to the Bone, Hey Doll Baby, etc).  In addition, I always look at the personalities behind the music; these 2 sisters are so down-to-earth, lovely and kind --- which makes me like their music even more.  Their new album, ""Restless"", proves they have maintained their wonderful talents through the past 10 or so years we hadn't heard from them.  Thank you for this new album, Janis and Kristine!!"
"All original, all delightful <SEP> This is the first complete album by Lester Menezes.  All compositions are excellent and a pleasure to listen to.  Very well done."
Trespassing (Radio Edit) <SEP> I love the excellent production of Trespassing radio edit. Adam Lambert's vocals is just fantastic and really unique. I recommend this album.
Adam Lambert Remixes are Always Great <SEP> This remix just makes a great song ready to dance to or work out. Shortens some intro so gets right to the song
Five Stars <SEP> gorgeous song
"Great Song! <SEP> I do my research beforehand, and I only buy good music. I'd buy this again, just because the artist is so talented."
One Star <SEP> Sounds like a 12 year old just learning how to play the flute to an electro back beat.
"Catchy <SEP> Very catchy. If I did not know better, I would have sworn this was Papas Fritas. Worth a listen at least."
Fantastic <SEP> Sam Harris could sing the phone book and it would be beautiful.  His voice is simply amazing and I would recommend any CD he puts out.
One of my favorites <SEP> This is one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite performers. I like the smooth way she performs it and the clear way in which she delivers the lyrics. I wish she was still around.
Five Stars <SEP> music
should have been on cd <SEP> should have been on the cd! this is one of my favorites of the tracks. great lyrics and music and an even greater voice!
absolutely awful. <SEP> Was very disappointed.  I'll be sure to never order hits without knowing if the original artists are doing them again!
"WOW <SEP> A great value for the money. All the old , new, and a lot of tunes that I have never heard of."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great, under the radar album."
Choklate is one Tall Tasty Drink!!! <SEP> I LOVEEEEEE THIS EP!  I only wish it was a full album. This artist delivers with each release. Her music is felt and it feels good! I saw her in DC and she is even better live.. A must purchase....

"Artist is a Thief! <SEP> I purchased multiple CD's from Earl back in January. I paid almost $60 and I have yet to receive anything! I spent nearly 4 months going back and forth with him and listening to one excuse after another. Meantime, he has kept my money and I got stiffed. Buyers Beware!"
"Love <SEP> Such virtuosity. After dabbling with the trumpet for over 60 years and understanding what it takes
to realize this sort of virtuosity, I admit to being deeply in love with this woman. What an amazing
talent, and this album is habit-forming."
Five Stars <SEP> Yes
Five Stars <SEP> satisfied
"Five Stars <SEP> Go Get It if you don't have it, you will want it!"
great <SEP> Love this song she have made a awesome come back. Amazon have alot of great songs just about anything you want amazon have it.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
"Not good <SEP> He sounds better live or on TV. The sound levels and noise on the MP3 was aweful, in fact painful. I deleted it."
breakdown <SEP> I purchased 7 of his tracks; love him.  I hadn't heard of him.  I was flipping the stations of tv and they had him in concert; the young man is badddddddddddddddd.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"Career Grenades <SEP> I have listened to Denny's comedy over the past 2 years or so and it has deteriorated to a great degree. In an age where there are SO MANY things to discuss and create jokes about. this ""comedian"" resorts to cliched topics, misogyny, and racial humor.  When he is not complaining about women, he get's into race and it is cringe-worthy bad, at time it feels as if he is about to enter into Michael Richards territory. There are a lot of comics that do racial humor but the ones who are successful at it, actually put some thought into it and do it in a smart way and not in a thoughtless and cruel way.  In an arena where there are so many comedians vying for attention, one needs to set themselves apart from the pack, in a good way. Denny's comedy doesn't do that. Each joke is as exhausting and predictable as the next. I listened to each track and do not recall laughing even once. If he wants to have a successful career, he needs to take some time to really explore what comedy is. This album straddles the line of anger and working out his own personal feelings onstage.  The only feeling that I get from this album after listening is, Denny hates women, people of other races, and himself. Instead of telling jokes, perhaps he should work out his issues with a psychologist. All I know is that if this is all he has to bring to the table, this album and his career will end up in the 99 cent bin at a Kentucky Walmart where I am sure the only fans of his reside."
"Really sloppy work by Amazon <SEP> My review is not of this recording, but of Amazon's offering. First of all, the Amazon page does not identify the conductor. It *does* identify the orchestra -- incorrectly. The page says ""Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra"". In an effort to discover who the conductor was, I blew up the image of the CD on the page enough to discover that it's the New Zealand Symphony."
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"Great music! <SEP> Grew up listening to these songs as a child, and they are still just as wonderful as ever!"
It's boring <SEP> It's boring. My favorite Country and Western piece is The Girl with the Far Away Eyes by Mick Jagger. Ha ha.
"awesome <SEP> I WILL SAY ""HE ENCOURAGE MY SOUL I WILL SAY IN GOD I WILL TRUST I WILL SAY HE IS GOD AND HE WILL NEVER CHANGE AND I WILL SAY HE IS ENOUGH. I SPEAK LIFE TO MY SOUL."
rip off price its a 13 dollar dvd <SEP> the albm is great bt 300 bcks is a JOKE and yo can find it for 13 dollars exactly what going rate is not 300 bcks thats highway robbery
Not happy... In fact... pissed! <SEP> NOT what I expected at all! If you're going to advertise a song like this one. You better give the buyer what they are looking for.
"Well Done <SEP> This is a nice album, one to just have playing when you want music that is not intrusive, yet interesting and engaging when you want to concentrate on it. That is a terrific balance to strike, good job!"
great techno album <SEP> i don't know alot about this artist but everything he puts out is always top notch.some of this album is some bone chilling techno.techno at its best.
Macy Gray <SEP> I didn't care for the way the way the song was done at all.  Some people might like it but not me.
Macy Gray Talking Book <SEP> I didn't like it at all.  I love the songs but not the way they were done.  I'm sorry but it just isn't my thing
Not the Bongos but I didn't expect it to be ... <SEP> Not the Bongos but I didn't expect it to be. Very enjoyable to listen to. Relaxing as well. Can tell Im aging.
"This was the excellent prelude to 1983's ""Talk Back"" and 1986's stunning ""Bridges ... <SEP> This was the excellent prelude to 1983's ""Talk Back"" and 1986's stunning ""Bridges Over Borders"". Included is fine live material."
"SORRY I PAID FOR IT !!!! <SEP> Some of the song is MISSING.
It's just jamming along and then DEAD."
"Bluegrass feel, very relaxing <SEP> I bought this album on the recommendation of my significant other. I'm not typically a huge fan of bluegrass music, but this album has definitely won me over. It's a good album to listen to when you're on a drive, as it's very folksy and relaxing. The music is catchy to boot!"
One Star <SEP> I hate gangster muzic
One Star <SEP> too dirty not good
Great Song <SEP> This is a great song by MCR but I will never again by an mp3 from amazon. Could not get it onto my ipod and I had to buy it again on itunes.
One hit and so misses <SEP> I see these as a one hit wonder.  But the one hit is spot on.
Five Stars <SEP> Dope
"Language <SEP> I guess I am too old fashioned. I bought this song for my son since he likes this kind of music. The beat is fine, but the language is just rotten. I wish the music today didn't have to have such rotten language in it!"
Japanther & Boots cant go wrong <SEP> This is my favorite song off Sorry To Bother You Japanther on the beat Boots on the mic short but sweet!
One Star <SEP> I did. to receive this one
Two Stars <SEP> soso
Gives me chills <SEP> I really like this song. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are powerful. The last line always gives me chills when I hear it.
Two Stars <SEP> it is ok
"Not the real group - just some schlocky garbage. I got sucked in by the name - ... <SEP> Not the real group - just some schlocky garbage. I got sucked in by the name - thought they were The Producers, the killer power-pop group"
Great music! <SEP> I have been a fan of Fernando de la Mora for quite some time and his interpretation of  these well-known songs is superb.  This CD did not disappoint me.
One Star <SEP> did not like it person sounded bad
"Excellent!!!!! <SEP> I am a Retired U. S. Air Force member & needed something other than music to motivate me while running.  I am just getting back into running after a long, long time away & I'm out-of-shape, too.  Well, the first time I ran & listened to ""Run to Air Force Cadence"" --I ran 2 & 1/2 miles!!!  I would not have made it 1/4 of a mile without it!!!"
One Star <SEP> dales colgate shave was to much
Major Colgate Advertisment <SEP> So the information is good but over half of the disk is advertisement for Colgate.  The speakers are a bit cheesy too. It is annoying but if you can get past it the small amount of information is useful.
"Don't waste your money <SEP> I am a huge WB fan, I own bobble heads, dishes etc. even went to the shareholder meeting. This CD was probably the biggest disappointment of anything I purchased at AMZN! Absolutley worthless and cost $9 for ten minutes. Had I known it was that short, I would not have ordered this.

I hope this is helpful to others though."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
"Not the original CD from Master Sha <SEP> This song is so beautiful, and this review is not based on the actual song, but the cd that I purchased. It is good for the purchaser to know that this is not the original CD sold by Master Sha  and it doesn't have an insert that has any background information on the song or Master Sha. I purchased this CD thinking it just may have been an older version of the Album, but appears to be a copy."
"Gospel Diva <SEP> When I first started to listen to Walter Hawkins and his Love Alive Choir, Tramaine's gritty voice was one of the treats of those albums. This album featuring her as a soloist remains one of my favorites.  In particular is the Medley with her stirring rendition of Changed. I love this song and listen to it almost every morning.  It get's me out the door in good spirits."
"Four Stars <SEP> makes my 4yo daughter happy, makes me crazy... what else can i say."
"cloud stinks <SEP> since i cannot access cloud to play the same  music i purchase twice i cannot play or download track.
i cannot use amozon cloud and no help from tech support"
"that he is one of the finest pianists in the world <SEP> Even though I have known Bob Nybakken for over 40 years, I can say, without prejudice, that he is one of the finest
pianists in the world.  This recording will demonstrate his extraordinary improvisational skills."
"What's New?????????? <SEP> It's a shame.  There's absolutely nothing new here in terms of sound.  Sounds
like Prince's old music standards which actually weren't that great.  It was NEW then.
It's SAD now. There's no innovation nor, any real creativity present in this  stuff.

They're just hip because they insist that they are.  This exemplifies the false claims.
I guess if, you hype something enough people will buy it.  Like P.T. Barnum said,
""There's a sucker born every minute.""  Every second now.

This...is just the same old tired combination of youth, glam,... girl time
at this particular moment in time, and hype served over dubbed synth."
"Love it! <SEP> I first heard this song at the Prince, Welcome to Chicago concert.  It was so good live I couldn't wait for the single to come out.  The instruments, vocals and lyrics are a Prince style groove with lots of funk.  I can't wait to hear what else Andy Allo has to offer!"
"Good CD. Was not sure what to expect when ... <SEP> Good CD. Was not sure what to expect when ordered. All songs are very good covers and worth listening to. Rick Wakeman's keyboards to ""not in love"" is excellent. Adds a very nice YES sound to the 10cc song."
One Star <SEP> i didn't know it was covers
"Duck and cover <SEP> I am not a fan of cover songs. I prefer new and original, however derivative it may be. I bought this at the request of a co-worker, and will give it to him. At least one of us may get something out of it."
"Don't buy this <SEP> The good news is that it's a great selection of covers. The performances vary from ""why bother?"" to ""pretty good."" But the sound quality is so bad that you won't listen to it more than a few times. Compressed, dull, and worse than a mediocre internet stream.  I don't understand how a band with such a great past allowed this to be released in such a crappy version. Sorry I bought it."
Five Stars <SEP> Teeny Tiny Spice Co. RULES!!!
"Depressing <SEP> I know nothing about Armenian music or the instruments upon which it is played.  I am ignorant, I confess it.  Still, I have a reaction to what I heard after listening to this CD.  My reaction is that this CD is depressing.  Practically every cut in the album is mournful, sorrowful and slow -- almost a dirge. I know the history of Armenia is tragic ..... I get that ....... but I don't want to hear eighteen consecutive somber laments ....however well played.  I don't know what options were available for consideration by the producers of this album, but it would have been nice to have included something lively and healing.  Surely somewhere a more joyful sound could have been found to provide balance in the Armenian spirit.."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great, enjoyed listening to music from my younger days."
Listen. Then listen again. <SEP> This is one of my favorite songs sung by Steve Wolf. It builds and builds in soul and spirit over repeated listening.
"Great new album from Wasabi Bytes <SEP> Went to the launch party in Bangkok last night. Wasabi Bytes played the songs from the new album ""We Are The Future"" great performance! the songs are new and fresh, and were performed with passion. I recommend the album, buy it...

K"
Two Stars <SEP> Music is not what I expected.  Thought it would be more slow and subtle.
"Matt, Awesome person and singer <SEP> Matt is awesome friend and excellent country singer we have known Matt since he was 16 years old. playing with Dave Pratt at the KMLE Country Celebrations.  All the show's he's done for Cancer , Make a wish etc..

We follow Matt to all of his shows and will follow him and his family forever. We are family as well.

Matt you are outstanding!  We love you!  Kathie & Mitch and Jennie and Roger"
Don't get it <SEP> Horrible. I thought this sounded like it could be a cool project but it really really isn't. Just play any 2 Fugazi songs at the same time and you have the same thing.
Five Stars <SEP> Music that leads you in worship of our King.
Antestor has chemistry <SEP> This is another good Album by Antestor. The songs on this album are well made and the melody is excellent.
"Bought for teen daughter... <SEP> Music wasn't that great and neither was the performance.  Words were reasonable, but daughter wouldn't listen to it or consider it any from of ""replacement"" for her current appetite of country western music.  (which in this mom's opinion, has questionable lyrics, morals, and stars in the mix!)"
Good song <SEP> This is a good song to listen too. I love listening to it on a daily basis since I purchased it.
Love it! <SEP> One of my favorite Christmas Songs - Dara Maclean has sung it so passionately.
Wonderful interpretation <SEP> This is a wonderful interpretation of Couperin works.  I believe it is the first of what will be performances of all Couperin's works.
"Made me wish I was deaf <SEP> Using this song for Man of Steel would be like hanging fuzzy green dice from the rear view mirror of a Lamborghini Reventon and putting a ""my kid beat up your honor student"" sticker on the bumper."
"Dissapointing <SEP> I've been a big fan of the Plump DJs for over a decade...Maybe I'm just getting too old for this music, but this album was a real dissapointment. I can't really even recomend one track... :("
Nice song <SEP> I love listening to this song. I have played this song over and over and over again. It's really a mixture of r&b and rap. Love the beat and tempo. I need your love is a really nice song.
Good song <SEP> Used as a background track for a worship song in Church. Worked great. Downloaded fast. This performance track is close to original.
One Star <SEP> Did not let me download it
GREAT SONG <SEP> This song is probably one of Chris Mann's best. It really shows his beautiful talent. Very beautiful song in a very similar style to Josh Groban.
Five Stars <SEP> Terrific...... makes lyrics his own.
"Two Stars <SEP> Great voice, horrible c/d"
No <SEP> Terrible music and song choice.  Do not recommend.
One Star <SEP> Terrible music. Big disappointment.
Five Stars <SEP> This is at the top of my Christmas play list every year
Who wouldn't <SEP> I don't know anyone that is not a Rod Stewart fan.  I love everything he has ever sung.  Merry Christmas to all.
love it <SEP> I've always been a Rod Stewart fan....Hey I don't write novels. I don't write books either or much of anything......................
Great Song for the Holidays <SEP> Love this song! The collaberation with Ce-lo Greene was wonderful! Really enjoyed sitting around and listening to this song. I would give it a 5 star rating!
My favorite Velvet Underground song <SEP> I love this song.
"Smooth as Silk <SEP> I love Rod Stewart and usually ignore famous singer's Christmas albums and hits, but Rod Stewart's voice is like butter and I love this!"
"Superb! <SEP> If you're a fan of any genre of music, this album is a must have. Ytcrack is a musical genius, so take a knee, bitch. If you don't have this pure fire album full of hammer-like APT lyrics and phenomenal flow, then you have no business in the nerd rap community. Ytcracker and Hairetsu have teamed up again to create something that'll make you want to slap a valley girl and proceed to take that cute chick from Calc 2 out to a nice steak dinner. Nerd life."
almost as good as the book cd you wrote and produced called ... <SEP> almost as good as the book cd you wrote and produced called s (square root) he....I have a copy ...blessed be mentor. http://genius.com/Saul-williams-list-of-demands-reparations-annotated a million kudos
Five Stars <SEP> bueno
"Wish I cloud have my free song... <SEP> I really liked the preview of the song, but unfortunately I could never get the free download.  I tried several times, but it never worked."
"Not only for Christmas <SEP> I really love it when a singer puts their own spin on an old classic such as ""We Three Kings""."
"I hate that I can only play it on the Amazon ... <SEP> I hate that I can only play it on the Amazon cloud. Once I have purchased it, i believe I should be able to listen to it on any platform."
"Incredible, just incredible - an all out album - nothing left on the table <SEP> There are those who create products and there are those who create CATEGORIES. Major credit to Agam for creating ""Carnatic Progressive Rock"" - a sorely needed category, while taking away nothing from either of the constituent art forms or even worse, patronizing them.

It was an absolute pleasure to hear the nuances of the ragas stand and belong right next to full-throttle rock guitars and thundering drums. Just cannot get over Swans of Saraswati. Bantureeti never sounded so good. The section at [5:45] ""raama naama mane, raama naama mane vara khaDga mivi | raajillu naiyya tyaagaraajuni kE"" is pure Genius! The build-up leading to the crescendo with the drums following closely is easily one of the best musical phrases I have ever heard.

I hope that I have the pleasure of seeing these guys live soon. You have created a die-hard fan today. Even though I have access to all your tracks on Spotify, I got a copy from here as well to support you guys. Also, I will fork over for every bit of merchandise that you guys bring to the market. May I suggest that you start by releasing a poster of your badass coverart?

But seriously guys, whatever you do, don't stop. Cannot wait to listen to what you create next... (more interpretations of classic Carnatic kritis : >)"
music <SEP> This song is older but never outdated.  Our choir sings it and it was great to hear the recorded version. Love all Maurette Brown-Clarke songs and this is no exception.
"I Love The Beat!!! <SEP> I Love, Love, Love it.... I listen to it daily while I exercise."
I think I'm in love with Owl City <SEP> I play this over and over. I think I'm in love with Owl City.
"The content was great, but the recording quality was not. <SEP> I was surprised at the poor quality of the recording.  It sounded as if someone had copied the record onto a cassette and sold it.  I was disappointed."
One Star <SEP> Not that good
"It's JT - did you expect anything less than 5 stars??? <SEP> This is the most beautiful rendition of ""In The Bleak Midwinter"" that I've ever heard.  The lyrics to this song are incredible by itself but then add James Taylor's soothing vocals and his unique guitar style and you've got the most dreamy walk though a winters day that you could ever imagine long and long ago."
Children's songs <SEP> Great children's music in Spanish.  All the traditional songs I remember as a child are now enjoyed by my granddaughter.
Five Stars <SEP> fun
Where are the liner notes? <SEP> No liner notes for buying a full album.  Not acceptable.
Four Stars <SEP> it is Ella what more can I say
It is catchy because it has a great beat and melody and I recommend <SEP> This song is sung by a person who sings songs. It is catchy because it has a great beat and melody and I recommend it
OUTSIDE  INTRUDER <SEP> NOT  SURE  WHAT  SLINKY  THING  IS  BUT  LOVE  THE  RHYTHM  OF  THIS  SONG  IF  I'M  NOT  MISTAKEN  SLINKY  THING  IS  A  WOMAN  I  NEED  TO  LISTEN  CLOSELY  TO  THE  LYRICS  OF  THIS  SONG  TO  REALLY  GET  A  BETTER  UNDERSTANDING  OF  THIS  SONG .
Full and fun <SEP> This album ranges from fun to lullaby and I love every minute! It's hard to choose a favorite track but this week I'm loving Pirate and Ezekiel.
"Rather dull <SEP> This a collection of buildups to a tune that is brief, seems to lack a conclusion, and then the buildups finally end.
The orchestra is terrific, but the piece is not worthy of their notice. As with other ""marches"" by Wagner, they are really more like overtures. So, the buyer of march music should beware."
"Monotone - to the extreme <SEP> I've been led to believe that this chap is a 'singer/songwriter' - well, I can accept his songwriting title, but he is not (in my opinion) a singer. His voice just drones on & on & on in a monotone sound - even in the song 'Shout' he doesn't raise his voice/tone any higher than the sound of a low-speed ceiling fan!

Maybe he should have only made a single, with 'Fighting since the....' on A-side along with either '....Motorway', 'Chatsworth Ave' or 'Caffeine & Saccharin' as B-side - or maybe an EP with all four. The rest are of no worth.

Some may say I haven't listened to the beauty & meaningfulness enclosed in the lyrics. I would totally agree - because I was so damned bored hearing the sound of his voice that I couldn't concentrate & was starting to nod off!

One good point though, great backing sound from The Metropole Orkest."
Two Stars <SEP> Not like the original tv version I heard but a little twisted.
One Star <SEP> It only downloaded 20 seconds. I cannot get the entire song. 
"Track is INCOMPLETE <SEP> This is an incomplete track. Seems like it is impossible to find a good recording of this piece. I picked this one because it is not live and therefore doesn't include people noises like coughing, shuffling, etc. Big mistake!!!"
"disappointing <SEP> I LOVE the movie and the music.  I tried for some time to locate at least some of the music in other works by the composer (Victor Young); soundtracks, etc.  When I located this soundtrack, I thought I had won the lottery.  The music is what I wanted, but the sound quality is really pathetic; a truly unpleasant experience.  According to the jacket information, ""The music masters were mono (the film was also mono, but its original engagements used the Perspecta soundtrack, a kind of fake stereo) and mostly in very good condition, housed in the Paramount vaults.  A couple of tracks only existed on acetates (which we cleaned up as best we could).""  I  have a DVD of the movie and the sound has clarity and depth.  As someone who truly enjoys music as an experience, not just background noise, I believe they should have left this one in the vault; a real disappointment."
"Average album <SEP> Music: Ram Sampath

1. Jee Le Zaraa -------------------------- 6/10
A pleasant song of a saddened heart sung well by Vishal Dadlani. He shows his non-rock flair in this song which has a decent tempo. The overall feeling of the song is good, just fails to make enough of an impression.

2. Jiya Lage Na -------------------------- 6/10
A track that blends the Indian classical tune with hip hop beats. Fairly melodic and soothing and Sukhwinder Singh is held on a tight leash of the classical tune, which is welcome change of pitch for him. Overall, the song sounds pleasing, but fails to completely capture our hearts.

3. Hona Hai Kya -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/10
A pretty decent song of uncertainty and despair which successfully injects a sense of urgency to the mood. The song does a fair amount of justice to it's purpose. Suffers from a being a cliche track.

Final verdict: Overall, gets a 5/10. There are some decent tracks, but none of them break through the must-listen barrier and stay just ok. The other songs are fairly boring bringing down the stock of this album."
"hop on the rocks <SEP> I just adore toby keith! Especially his love songs, which he sings with such heart. Sure o sure, he can have us all on our feet with a rousing rah-rah usa song, but I think the love songs are much more difficult to accomplish. Perhaps that is why I enjoy them more."
Pass <SEP> Sounds like a bunch of midi guitars. Wish it was acoustic.
One Star <SEP> Download did not work. Charged me for the song though.
"No , it's not Sebastian  Bach get over it <SEP> Regardless what Sebastian Bach wants you to believe A Skid Row reunion would barely show up on a radar blip. And honestly who needs it when you can see Sebastian Bach play anyways? He's ultimately had a better career then Rachel Bolan and the rest of his old band.  Witch brings me to I Remember you two a cover version by Skid Row of a Skid Row classic. This up to date version is a lot more punkish with a faster tempo. New/old singer Johnny Solinger is not a Bach clone but can be heard at times doing his best version of Bach. Think of Skid row and I Remember you Two as an old girlfriend from high school, the original band and song will live in your memories reminding you always of the good times. While the new version and band reminds you that like them you have gotten on with your life."
Life Changing <SEP> I don't know how I lived my life before hearing this song. After I purchased it all of the sudden life has become more clear to me. Thank you for helping me find my Luckydo.
"Changed my life <SEP> Before this song, I had no idea how to improve my life.  Thanks to this song I now know the missing part to change my life for the better - I needed a CLEAN Yak.  Here I was with a dirty one, not realising my error!  Get this song and hopefully it will change your life like it did mine!"
Can't get this song out of my head! <SEP> Love this song.  The lyrics are great and Ashley has an amazing voice!  It's nice to have a new Christmas song that I can listen to and not get tired of.  This is my new favorite!!
"How I feel <SEP> This song is a good song, when someone is too depressed and thinking of hurting oneself, this song will help u think twice before u do something."
Has become my favorite <SEP> I have fallen for the voice of Johnathan.  Johnathan's voice is so strong in this song that I can feel the music.  Even though this is in Italian I can understand the song since I know it so well in English.  I have played this whole CD for my friends and we are becoming fans.  I love the entire track and can easily suggest it for everyone.  If you don't know that you like Opera I would suggest this song you may find that you are won over.
"Katey scores with this classic! <SEP> I gave this song five stars because Katey makes this classic her own.
I recommend this to all Sons of Anarchy fans!
A+"
great CD <SEP> great CD
"Wow, brings tears to my eyes <SEP> A very impressive couple. He isn't as experienced as the other tenors I have heard but his tone, power, clarity and ability to hit every note is impressive indeed. They are teenagers, sing in Italian, and I believe he will surpass Pavarotti when he learns to embrace the emotion of the pieces he sings. Please note that I have most of what Pavarotti & Bochelli have recorded and not impressed very easily. I see a great future for them."
"Love! Love! Love! <SEP> I love this song. Charlotte and Jonathan did an amazing job! They both sing so beautifully together, I could listen to them for hours! If you are considering buying this song, just buy the album! Lol! I started by buying the song ""The Prayer"" that they did (which is another amazing song, they all are!), then Caruso, then Forse, then another 3 and before I knew it I had already spent more on all the songs I bought than what the album costed! Lol! Just buy the whole album, you won't be sorry :-)"
Solid jazz with funk <SEP> Pretty good song with some serious funk. Good mixed tempos. You'll want to dance to it. I didn't like every one of Chester Thompson's songs but this one is worth a listen.
"Great song by an up-and-coming artist. <SEP> This is a terrific country song that deserves airplay. Mr. Stringfellow has a great voice, and the writing is really great."
"I was overjoyed. He is so talented <SEP> I admire John and, when I found out he was a musician, I was overjoyed. He is so talented."
Another great song from NMK <SEP> It's highly entertaining just like all their work. If you haven't heard much of them please check out their self titled album. Every song on it is great.
"Different <SEP> Playing this is like pushing the reset button and reharmonizing the energies of the cells, organs - body. Who knew."
One Star <SEP> Wrong song downloaded
"Beauty from Guilt <SEP> I loved this song. In a sense I'm glad it wasn't played and over played on the radio because it would feel exploited. It's very genuine, very personal and if more people took time to listen to it I think they wouldn't give her such a hard time about her personal life. This song is full of remorse as we already know the reason why it was written. Knowing the song was written before she left her 1st husband and before he knew his marriage was over gives the song so much more depth."
Four Stars <SEP> Interesting and fun track that I would listen to again
Five Stars <SEP> great
One Star <SEP> Not a D Peoples fan
"this is a great addition to Bjork's large catalog <SEP> this is a great selection of remixes. Bjork is an electronic innovator (which many people forget) and he selections of artists to remix her material is unique in itself.
A standout version would be Virus--I especially like this album because it is a reworking of Biophelia which is my favorite Bjork album."
"Too experimental... for me <SEP> Didn't make Biophilia any better for me.  Love Bjork, this is just that one set of albums I take exception to.  But, music is a matter of taste.  What didn't sit well with me, you may well love."
"Heartfelt ballad by a timeless voice <SEP> Richard Marx has a gift for penning lyrics that go straight to the heart.  Keep a few tissues on hand as this song will tug on your heartstrings even if you don't have kids, and even if it's not Christmas time.  The sentiment is simple: Your memories of times gone by can live fondly and forever on in your heart even when children grow old and apart.  Marx croons: ""The sweetest days never fade away....I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be"".  He recalls when his child was 9 or 10 and afraid of shadows on the wall.  Just a few words of comfort and the knowledge that dad was only a few steps down the hall made everything all right.  What parent wouldn't give the world to have that feeling of love again?  As time goes by and families are not always together for holidays or other special times, there is still tenderness in the heart to think of the innocence of our children in younger days.  Our memories never fade away if we keep them alive in our hearts and minds."
"If Only the Whole Album was This Good... <SEP> Music is like wine, art, food: a matter of personal taste.  In my personal view, this piece of music is wonderful, but I don't really know what description to give it.  Classical jazz?  Jazzy classical?  Pop? (doubtful).  At any rate, Marsh has a unique style with electric violin.  Again, I only wish the entire album was as good as this one piece; I'm glad to have IT...without having to buy the whole thing."
"Hate It <SEP> Really was not what I was looking for, it was not calming made me not want to listen to it.

It is in the draw."
Didn't care for it. <SEP> I was a fan of Marx years ago but wasn't a fan of this album.
One Star <SEP> ERROR never ordered
"Great Christmas Music <SEP> One of my favorite modern Christian cd's. It's upbeat and passionate, very refreshing from all the other not-so-good seasonal music."
"... know where the reviewers are getting this is an awesome recording! <SEP> I don't know where the reviewers are getting this is an awesome recording!!! I'm playing this on a very high end system and the sound quality is very bad!!!Actually unlistenable. I was going on the reviews when I decided to buy it...Wow,what a waste...At least the money went to a good cause!!!"
"What a waste of $20 bucks <SEP> What a waste of $20 bucks! Sound quality is awful, mixing is poor. There are a couple of flashes of the greatness of this band, but this was certainly not one of their better nights. Avoid"
"Price is not right <SEP> You can find other collections with 100+ songs, which INCLUDE all these songs. I found such a collection for 1.99 and one for 2.79. So I'm very disappointed."
"Track 1 Incomplete <SEP> Great album, but Amazon needs to Fix Track 1 - Why do I. It is an incomplete file at only 1:09 and I had to download it from iTunes...  Full song is 4:29!"
One Star <SEP> Wrong song
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
Two Stars <SEP> Received CD today for a birthday present for my granddaughter and the case was cracked.
"One Star <SEP> Didn't open in the Amazon music app. Had to listen to it in iTunes. Well done, Amazon.."
"wow <SEP> Loved this song from the moment I heard it but than again I love everything from her, she has such feeling behind her songs."
"TOBY BRINGS IT ON!!! <SEP> A true country song!!
It brings memories of past failures and successes.,.,Like on the rocks kind of thing.
Let loose, listen!!!"
"hard to mess up chillout... <SEP> But they did! continuous mix should flow, however half these songs begin in a different key than the one before it so it clashes. then there are the grating voices that are flat, or, other noises that don't belong in the track that makes you wonder wtf is going on. The whole point of chillout is to foster a relaxing environment."
"No lyrics! <SEP> I wished this had the words, didn't realize it was instrumental."
"Afu-Ra!!!!!! <SEP> Dope Hip Hop....Trust me, I know Afu and that banging Brooklyn ish!"
Don't buy <SEP> Wow my 6 year old was super excited and now she is growling at me.  No lyrics how disappointing!
Two Stars <SEP> No vocals:(
No lyrics no not waste your money on this <SEP> No lyrics no not waste your money on this. Why ca't I get refund with this are misleading like this?
Something's missing <SEP> There were no lyrics. It was not at all what I was expecting. Do not waste your money on this download.
"Not usable ""as is"" <SEP> Transcription is OK, but there is an ""improvised"" clean lead solo during the bridge. This makes the track un-usable if you are a lead player."
"Cthulhu Fhtagn! <SEP> Another great take on the classic story from the guys at the HPLHS. Stays true to the original (enough) but since they've released what is widely known as the best CoC adaptation so far with their film, it gives them room to be more unique in their re-telling.

This is frankly an excellent product, with great acting, music, effects, art and props, and offers the same insane standard of quality we've come to expect from the HPLHS. If you're interested, navigate through their labyrinthine website and you'll find a page dedicated to behind-the-scenes for all the current DART shows, including read-along scripts, trailers, and lots of extra knowledge. Alternatively, you can just access it here:

[...]

Honestly, just buy it. I've never been disappointed by any HPLHS products - it's ridiculous. I'm looking forward to the next three DART shows, and after listening to this, or any others, you will be too."
Listening to right now! <SEP> Brilliant piece of music by a beautiful band that I love and admire.  Very rocking and kick ass vibe to it!
One Star <SEP> It would be excellent if I could remove that dude talking.
"i don't have <SEP> this song never download to my kindle so i don't know what it sounds like besides the sample i heard before buying.,"
Jody Rocks! <SEP> I love how troubled her soul is. I feel her pain! I met Jody at a con this past weekend.
"1:41 <SEP> I feel ripped off
this piece of music is less than 2 minutes long
oh well the way to get my money back"
"I wanted the music used as cues in the American ... <SEP> I wanted the music used as cues in the American version of ""the killing"".
This isn't it.
I'll just have to keep looking."
Superb! <SEP> What can you say!?!?! TSO is superb!
Love the Instrumentals <SEP> I love having the Christmas music playing n the background without the interruption of voices singing when I am entertaining.
Five Stars <SEP> Great product and fast shipping definitely would order again
"Nice discovery! <SEP> Love it! Awesome songs, a must buy for Christmas! Feels like dancing already - really like the  Turbulance one and the techno echo effects...."
"Great <SEP> Never heard of this artist before but glad I discovered him.

Funky tunes, great beats.  One to enjoy!

Some great compositions here.

Well worth the price."
Sound was good. <SEP> No problems noted. Sound was good.
One Star <SEP> This really does not sound like rain on a roof.....It sounds like static on a TV with no reception.
"Delicious package of remixes <SEP> I'll never understand how Colton's single ""That's Me"" didn't shoot right to the top of the Billboard Dance Chart based just on the Dan McKie mix, which channeled the deep house groove of the Liberty City classic ""Some Lovin"" and combined it with Colton's sensual, masculine vocal hook. It was the perfect balance between his recent singer-focused songs and his older, big club/sex aimed tracks like ""Everything.""

""Let Me Live Again"" gets a wicked set of remixes from the likes of WaWa, Tony Moran & Warren Rigg, Frankie Knuckles, and Craig C, and each mix brings something different to the table, from hard techno to more melodic house.

While I would normally go for the circuit sounds of Tony Moran and Warren Rigg, this time around, it's not my favorite mix--Colton's vocal delivery is smooth and soulful, so creating an anthem out of the accompanying hard house instrumentation doesn't quite fit. I actually prefer the Craig C mix, which takes the same anthematic approach but somehow keeps the instrumentation just as melodic as the vocals while creating more logical harmonies between the two.

My second favorite club mix, while not featuring much of Colton's vocals, is the j-c club mix. Remember the techno-rave scene from 1992? Like many other remixes these days, this mix taps into that retro sound to create a slammin' hardcore techno track.

Other mixes add tastes of trance, soulful house, electro house, and contemporary radio-friendly electro pop, many of which also work well with Colton's vocal delivery.

And finally, the WaWa mixes are notable for a more straightforward dance track without too many bells and whistles if that's your thing."
"POWERFUL and SPIRIT-Driven! <SEP> The Jesus Is The Man Project is one of the most powerfully Spirit-driven experiences you can have, and listening to the CD is second only to the in-person LIVE event!  Do yourself and your soul a favor and BUY THIS CD!  Your Spirit will DANCE and SING along!!!"
"Linda R. Must Have <SEP> If you like Ronstadt this is a must have, but get the original, not the remastered version. I have both."
"AMAZING!!!! <SEP> Absolutely love this cd!!!! Anyone who purchase this will not be disappointed. If you are you have bad taste in music. This cd breaks the monotony of all the songs you hear on the radio. This cd is grown, sexy and personal. It's a must buy people!!!"
Cameo <SEP> I like  cameo songs
One Star <SEP> Booo
One Star <SEP> Horrible chopped and screwed version 
"Don't You Dare Call This Rap? <SEP> Remember when rap used to be incredible and heartfelt?  Because of artists like Hurricane Chris releasing these crap singles, rap is dying (fast)."
"Two Stars <SEP> So so, sometimes I take chances with my type of music."
"I'm Stepping Out <SEP> An oldie but you can't go wrong with Tony Orlando.  This has to be my number 2
favorite of his songs."
"Great song - good beat <SEP> I am using this song for my dance class - girls ages 8 to 10. They love it, it's got a great beat, and I can always be assured this music is age appropriate and family friendly. Cute song!"
It a live recording. I wanted the origina song. <SEP> It's not listed as being recorded live!
"Not What I expected <SEP> It was a definite ""OK"" but it is hard to listen to this particular song and not compare it to the original Jimi Hendrix, If you like the band in general it is not to bad, if you just like this particular song and are looking for a different twist to it I would look for another."
"Five Stars <SEP> Amazing song..it's just what you need ,,we all as Christians go through tough times.."
"i love this song <SEP> song not available on itunes. i'd been looking for it for a very long time. thank you amazon, so much"
Different <SEP> Different music just not my particular flavor.....it is not something you really want to listen to over and over. The band is not bad but they might try a different type of music in my opinion.
Perfect song for wedding prelude music! <SEP> Nicely done!
"It's Okay <SEP> I like to try different music.....this is okay, I don't think it is the music that would put Jolie Maman over the top but it is easy listening. It just doesn't sound ""New"" to me. The ""Same O Same O"". I think with the right song she could be more popular but not this music. Artist is good.....the music itself not so much."
"Nice Version! <SEP> Not the original artist for the song but it is a very nice rendition I would highly recommend it. Very ""Laid Back"" version really enjoy listening to it."
The Best!!! <SEP> My girlfriend and I absolutely love this song and what it says!! Lots of meaning and awesome lyrics!! Aaron Lewis writes from the heart!!!
"Oops, Not what I wanted <SEP> I wanted the original song, this just doesn't have the same feel. The words may be the same but but the feeling is not."
"Million Dollar Fun <SEP> ""Million Dollar Girl"" by Trina, Keri Hilson,and Diddy is a fun music video touching on living the lavish side of life. The lyrics are catchy and all three of the singers appear to be having a good time in the music video for the song. It is also a versatile song because I recently heard it in a slightly different way on the ""Catwalk Megahits 2012"" collection. ""Million Dollar Girl"" by Trina featuring Keri Hilson and Diddy is a good musical track for those who like songs with dance,pop, and hip-hop elements."
Breath deep and level the buzz we begin  ! <SEP> This might be best Stone Sour ever ! The studio quality is as fresh as the tribal acid jazz drums
"this rocks!!!!! <SEP> One hell of a song!!!!!
Great instrumental, Seattle grunge at one of its best. Mad Season is a great band."
Five Stars <SEP> I have a chevy.
Excellent song <SEP> This was a uplifting and energy boosting song to play when your feeling down.  This song really made a difference for me and brought me into the presence of the Lord.
no substance i should see about refund <SEP> There is just nothing to this ! I cant find enough stuff to discuss! So lame that i already have way to much time invested!!!!!!!!
"My favorite song from Eisbrecher <SEP> I love fast, hard songs. This song sounds cool, is fast, and is hard. I am glad I bought this song and I think it is well worth one dollar."
Five Stars <SEP> I love the beat on this
"Beautifully written and composed: sublime. <SEP> I find the vocals incredibly beautiful.  The words are brilliant.  I love the beat, guitar, other sounds too.  Incredibly well written and composed song. One of the songs that makes me feel good to be alive.  Very few songs do that for me."
"File is faulty - find another version. <SEP> Love the song, but do not download this version. There's a terrible edit/stutter in the music at the 15-second mark."
"Climie Fisher <SEP> Climie Fisher were a UK pop duo formed by vocalist Simon Climie (born ) and former Naked Eyes keyboardist Rob Fisher ( - ). In 1988, they had a great success with two big international hit singles. Career The duo are best known for the 1987 hit single ""Love Changes (Everything)"" which reached Number 2 in the UK and in South Africa (on re-release), Number 7 in Germany, Number 8 in Switzerland, Number 15 in Austria & Number 23 in the US, all in 1988."
One Star <SEP> I hate it!
"the song was completely wrong <SEP> it sounded like a marching band song; someone has labled the song wrong

i have listened to this song many times and it is a beautiful balad; i hope amazon gets it right"
Amazon downloads suck. <SEP> Amazon downloads suck.  They make it impossible to  put it on your phone or computer
lazy love <SEP> Love this song. I feel like this alot. Like sometimes i don't want to even go to work or school. I just want to lay under him.
Good song. <SEP> A good song... difficult to download via Amazon but at least I could put it in iTunes and on my iPod.
Don't be fooled. <SEP> I didn't read closely enough to realize this was a re-make . . . and not a very good one at that.  Very disappointed with the purchase.
no headline--but a tombstone might be nice <SEP> i don't know what is up with people scrubbing vocals from something and then laying down a performance over it.
It sucks <SEP> No where near the Moulin Rouge version which I love. Then you have all that other stuff you don't want
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Amazing <SEP> This is one of my favorite songs.  It is such a sweet song with a beautiful melody.
"... brain tumor) and i can't remember her name creates perfect, beautiful song offering joy and peace to listeners <SEP> as always extraordinary voice of singer (sorry brain tumor) and i can't remember her name creates perfect, beautiful song offering joy and peace to listeners."
"Its ok. <SEP> First of all i'd like to start by saying the video game was great (thats not the multi-player im talking about), im talking about the main game part, and 2nd this soundtrack is pretty cool but the reason i only gave it 1 star is because some music cannot be found on this track for some odd reason, there is alot on it some 30-40 tracks but not the ones i wanted! I feel like i got ripped off but its not like i can take back a MP3 is it??"
"bland <SEP> The same old tired ""middle eastern sounds with metal guitar"" soundtrack. It's bland and uninspired. If you are interested in orchestral mixes(like I am) the sound is very crisp and high quality. Jack Wall(besides some of his Mass Effect stuff) is probably the most generic video game composer in the business and his stuff is so stale, he almost has a sound like he just heard ""The Rock"" soundtrack for the first time."
Can't beat the price. <SEP> Even if the song was not free it would be a great price. Brandon never ceases to amaze me. By the way it is pronounced HAMOOL.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"New but takes me back <SEP> This song is new, but it takes me back to a time that made me happy. A time when Tim McGraw was still a new artist."
"As with (almost) all TimmyMac... <SEP> I Like It, I Love It, I Want (to hear) Some More of It!
 Seriously, one of his best ever, in my opinion!"
great cod song <SEP> nuff said black ops 2 la la la la la la la las la la la la l ala la
Two Stars <SEP> Meh.
dont buy it <SEP> I thought it was going to be the full song based on the fact that I was directed to buy it from my Pandora page and I hit buy thinking I was buying the actual song. Very disappointed.
"wrong song <SEP> Buying this version was  waste of money. I didn't realize it was this version. Look carefully before purchasing, i.had clicked by from pandora but seems like it directed me to this song on amazon."
"HEARD IT SONG BY VISITORS TO OUR CHURCH... <SEP> I love intimate worship!! So, when a church that was visiting sang this to our congregation and we were able to join in...easily! I bought it that same week!!"
AWESOME! <SEP> Favorite CD right now. Love it! Phil is a great song writer and gifted vocalist. This a great CD for anyone who loves worship music.
"Five Stars <SEP> great live album, spirit filled"
Awesome CD! <SEP> This is one of my favorite CDs! I listen to this one more than any others. It's so encouraging.
Four Stars <SEP> Love the Anthem.  This has a few other nice songs on it also!
Five Stars <SEP> this classical vinyl is awesome .
Good Music <SEP> The quality was good
"Great collection of vintage Samhaim tunes <SEP> Great collection of vintage Samhain tunes.  If you are a lover of (real) oldies and Halloween music, buy this right now.  That is all"
"Love me some Blaine! <SEP> What a talented young guy!  Glee is lucky to have him! Anxious to hear more from him. Bought his ""Human"" album and enjoyed it a lot!!!"
"A great new lbum! <SEP> Congreso returns to surprise us with a new album to great level. ""Con los ojos en la Calle"" was recorded in Chile and mixed in Brazil by Alvaro Alencar, the great sound engineer, winner of several Grammy prizes, in charge of many albums of the great ones of the Brazilian music.
Congreso returns inviting to Ed Motta (""Mundo al Revs"") and Lenine (""Con los Ojos en la Calle""), those with the music of Sergio ""Tilo"" Gonzlez and the lyrics of ""Pancho"" Sazo, turn this album into one of their better records."
The best <SEP> I love every single song in this album. Love how they flow together. So soothing makes me want to fall asleep too. My babies all love it.
But product was fine. <SEP> Only issue was that the case was cracked when I received it even though it was still wrapped in the cellophane wrapper.  But product was fine.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful original music from a talented young composer!
"astounding <SEP> This is the best music ever. i like doing my house work to this music. It is so uplifting. gives me such a wonderful feeling,"
One Star <SEP> This I did not order. ..
"Good Song but not my favorite of his. <SEP> This is a good Peter Bradley Adams song, but not my favorite of his.  The lyrics are good and so is the music.  The lyrics give you something to think about it.  The music does not carry me as much as some of his other great songs, but the lyrics really make you think."
"I love this song. <SEP> This is one of the best song.  It has a good exciting melody.  I heard this song for the first time in 1970 when I was a college student in Vientiane, Laos."
12am Banger! <SEP> Great tune!!  Easy to mix into and out of.  Throw it into your set and watch the hands go up.  Askew keep it up!
"Killer Track <SEP> ...but Zeds Dead is always awesome, so I didn't expect any less. He did a good job of preserving the integrity of Breathe, but there's a lot of good non-vocal, perfect for mixing over."
Amazing sound! <SEP> These two songs intertwine perfectly and I feel like Mike Tompkins is brilliant for discovering and producing such a nice mash up.
"Five Stars <SEP> Just great. Calming, soothing."
Five Stars <SEP> like it
Power Rangers Redux <SEP> Great album from Ron Wasserman and I look forward to what he releases next and hopefully I won't have to wait that long.
"Celtic Americana <SEP> These two Canadian singers and musicians perform Celtic Americana music.  I love the sound of it.  They play some rather unusual instruments, such as the harmonium and bodhran."
"taylor rules <SEP> I can't stop watching the AGT vids, Taylor's delivery is classic old school, all the inflections, pauses, and timbre in his voice, a fully developed comedian...he should have won...bought this to help make his million dollars...hope it helps...
really think he could carry a 30 minute comedy show...(somebody out there sign him up...)"
"<3 <3 <3 <3 <SEP> I <3 Sufjan, and he makes the best Christmas music... even if it gets a little weird sometimes on this set."
"I wish I could return this <SEP> Why'd you have to change, Sufjan? Stickers are offensive ("
One Star <SEP> Dismally bad. Taking it to the thrift shop
Happy <SEP> Not a song he does that doesn't move me.  Lukas rocks the house down with his style.  I would not say he is like his father.  Yet his voice is sometimes hard to define the difference.
"Wonderful songs even if you don't understand Swedish <SEP> I am a huge September fan.  However, buying music sung in Swedish, when I don't understand a word, seemed foolish.  Surprisingly, I really like this album.  If you are a September fan, and can find it, I highly recommend it.  I had to buy my CD used from overseas,  for about $20 altogether.  For me, it was well worth it."
"Love the lyrics <SEP> This isn't the usual Genre I  to listen to ,but the lyrics grab me. They speak to me.
I love how raw and unfiltered the lyrics are. They really are ""real"" and not just playing
""religious"" games.
I would recommend this music to anyone that likes the genre. I would recommend
this music to anyone that can appreciate ""real"" lyrics and can be open to hearing the message delivered in a
musically creative vehicle.
Good job, I will add this artist to library."
"N.O. <SEP> No. Really, no. Didn't care for it."
One Star <SEP> error I did not get this
mythical & long. <SEP> Unique is the best word I can come up with for this. Not exactly my style but maybe someone else will like it better than I do.
"OLD AND CLASSIC <SEP> VERY GOOD CD SHOULD HAVE MORE DIOMEDES DIAZ CLASSICS CD LIKE THIS.
THANK YOU"
"Not so good.. <SEP> Of course Aerosmith has set the bar pretty high so I expected alot, and this LP didn't deliver.  It seems as though they just went through the motions without the EMOTION that is in many of their other recordings.  Sorry"
"Amazing! <SEP> Becomes The Color is summed up in one word: amazing. It's perfect and Emily has a beautiful voice.
This song has opened me up to even more of her music."
not at all like the original uncut <SEP> It's censored but the description doesn't say so ...full of beeps and cut very short...not at all like the original uncut version
no one does it better than sufjan <SEP> I always try to dig into some of his holiday music for something different. He's like the that middle school music teacher who sneaked in all his college friends one night at the school for a jam session. I'd love to see him live!
"WHY!!!! WTF!!! <SEP> Why have this no talent, polished turd carrie underwood on an Aerosmith album!!!  Steven leave that garbage for your solo/american idull meterial not on an Aerosmith album!!!  This is the worst piece of garbage song since Alice Cooper's baby Wants song with the talentless polished turd queen Kesha....AGAIN I ASK WHY!!!  The rest of Welcome 2 My Nightmare was gold except for that trash, hopefully this new Aerosmith album will be the same."
"Too much like elevator music <SEP> I bought this based on 30 seconds, and lived to regret the purchase.  It ended up sounding like typical elevator music, so I actually ended up deleting it from my playlist."
Mudgrips & Moonshine <SEP> After watching the tv show Buckwild I found Colt Ford and a couple others which led me to this and I like It.
I love it. I don't have children <SEP> I bought it. I love it. I don't have children.
"brilliance! <SEP> I live under a rock because i'd never heard of gangnam style before a friend told me about LoPan Style. he showed me the original PSY video and then showed me LoPan Style. LoPan blew PSY out of the water! He brought the Lightning and the Thunder and he made it rain! I am so in love with this song! I annoy my niece with it because she hasn't seen Big Trouble in Little China, but im going to make her father fix that soon. While the video is euphoric, the song is just as good on its own! Everyone should buy it! Even John Carpenter loves this song! nuff said!"
Willie sings The First Noel <SEP> I've listened to a lot of Willie Nelson down through the years. I'll have to say that this is a typical Willie performance.
"This is a really good song 5 stars <SEP> TOTALLY worth 99 cents.  Everyone needs to check out this guys music it's really the bomb,  he should team up with 116"
Too 'gimicky' sounding. <SEP> Too  'gimicky'  sounding.
"Real Gospel <SEP> Mahalia is still a legend, and her music is the real gospel. She was and still is the real deal, and you know she felt the music and listening to her you will feel the spirit. Most gospel or soul singers of today simply showboat."
rats.. <SEP> ..only available in the USA.. will have to look on the itunes store for this one.. or even spotify.. so much for the global village..
Five Stars <SEP> Great.
Something Special <SEP> JESUS
Really? <SEP> I'm not sure what happened but I really like aerosmith and was extremely disappointed with all the music on this long delayed album.
"Great album <SEP> Great mix of music, sounds, lyrics, subjects.  Ne-Yo can't do much to disappoint me though, so I'm definitely a biased review."
"Not great at all <SEP> Maybe it's just not my type of music.... Did not seem like good song writing, not because of his singing ability"
"Great Song <SEP> As a red raider, this gives me chills. Reminds me of the reason I attended and graduated from Tech. Wreck 'Em"
"Awesome song!! <SEP> This song is amazing and captures the spirit of being on campus and going through college at Tech.
Great job Josh Abbott!

Long Live the Matadors!"
Five Stars <SEP> LOVE IT!
"great <SEP> This is a great pice, and it is totally worth the download and 99 cents.  It is a very relaxing, soft sound would recommend it to all.."
Five Stars <SEP> Great music.
"Free download <SEP> Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol"
Love it! <SEP> Beautiful music!!  I had a friend send me the link.  Great addition to my Celtic collection!!
"A few gems and some turkeys. <SEP> Some really obscure tracks on this compilation along with a few good ones.  Of course, when I discovered that some of the tracks were mislabeled and I had to go in and edit the properties to straighten it out, my opinion of the collection dropped off quite a bit.  Whoever filled in the properties for these transposed the properties in several instances.  Very unprofessional.  Audio quality could also have been better in some instances.  A number of well known songs that aren't sung by the artists that made them famous.  There are probably $5 worth of good songs mixed in, but I didn't find the overall collection to be very impressive."
At last! <SEP> It's such a pleasure to experience this class in the comfort of my own home.  It's the authentic Uma experience and true gem for advanced yogis to deepen their practice.
Thumbs up <SEP> Great meditation
"Winning it all <SEP> Great great song - the album is okay to, but listening to ""winning it all"" bring me back to that magical time we call ""the 80's""."
Willie Nelson has always been my favorite singer. Lukas sounds so much like him but ... <SEP> Willie Nelson has always been my favorite singer.  Lukas sounds so much like him but also has his own unique voice.  Love both of them.
"Not his best <SEP> The Bishop has been through so much I expected this CD to reflect that, but it had to much of a commercial sound."
"Back to a more upbeat sound <SEP> If this EP is any indication of the album to come, I am very excited. ""Good Times"" is a solid tune that is reminiscent of his earlier work and a great combination of his more recent work, but has a similar feel as Lennon's ""Instant Karma"". ""Loving You"" is the clear stand out track of the EP- it starts off with a classical piece that maybe original it may not, I'm not that familiar with the classical genre, but regardless it is a pretty piece and then it cuts-off and a hard driving piano rhythm comes on with a pure pop sound, like an ""Unfamiliar Faces"" Matt, but with the addition of strings throughout the song, the chorus is catchy and everything you want in a pop song. Sacred Hills could just have easily been on his last album ""Mobile Chateau"", It is good, but I'm afraid it is going to be one that is going to take multiple listening on a playlist before I truly appreciate it. ""Never Change"" is definitely a folk song, it is probably the prettiest song on the album, it reminds me of an earlier song of his ""Bound"", but it has a more personal sound to it- acoustic guitar, bass, lead vocal with no effect, and a subtle female backing on the chorus,so simply done and so perfectly beautiful. Overall this EP is just like Matt Costa himself it doesn't fit into any one genre, but somehow it all just goes together and you find yourself loving every bit of it."
Five Stars <SEP> favorite Christmas song
"A Christmas cracker <SEP> I love this song so much, it makes me go all gooey. Perfect Christmas song, I love Christmas and I love London, was this written for me?  Merry Christmas everyone"
Great song!! <SEP> Halestorm is quickly becoming a favorite band of mine! Love this song and many of their others too! Will be downloading more I'm sure!
This song is cool <SEP> I really love this song it brings joy and creative dance moves to mind. I love this song a lot.
"BRILLIANT for kids and adults! <SEP> Sunny Day Rainbows writes great music for kids, but parents and adults will truly appreciate their musical talent.  Reminds me a little bit of early REM, with fun little lyrics about squirrels in your bathtub, eating too many apples, going to the beach, riding a bike...the list goes on.  Parents who cringe every time they need to put on annoying kids music will enjoy listening to Sunny Day Rainbows...music you could put on at an adult BBQ and everyone would be bobbing their heads while they enjoy some ribs and a beer.  It's that kind of music!"
I don't think it is one of their good <SEP> I am not fond of this. I don't think it is one of their good ones
Did't like <SEP> I like some of her music but not all. Found out that I can use Amazon Prime Music for FREE.
"Wonderful Music <SEP> What a fresh approach to traditional music. Uplifting, upbeat and refreshing - truly remarkable. Listening to these songs is a great way to brighten your mood and uplift your perspective."
"The song is awesome but.... <SEP> There are two versions of this song (so far I heard them in YT.) but with so little preview, I can't decide if I should buy it or not. Too bad."
i hate it <SEP> it didn't download from the computer to my flashdrive. it must be out in cyber space somewhere because i paid for it n i didn't see it
"ICK!! <SEP> An electronic version of ""The Walking Dead"" theme, please. No, No and No. Can't you be a bit more creative than that??"
"Overkill. If you want a slick epic Hollywood style ... <SEP> Overkill.  If you want a slick epic Hollywood style interpretation of Baroque, then this is for you."
do not buy. <SEP> Is she a singer or actress? NO TALENT.
"Extraordinariily beautiful <SEP> Like Patricia Petibon herself, the music is breathtaking to see and lovely to hear. She is everything anyone could wish."
Absolutely love this album. <SEP> I can't stop listening to this album. It has cheered me up like nothing else.  I absolutely love this album.

Rhett and Link Music! <SEP> Another one of my favorites from Rhett & Link.
"One of my favorite musicians!!!! <SEP> Have yet to find anything by William Joseph I don't like.  He is imaginative, gifted and beautifully creative."
Two Stars <SEP> meh
Two Stars <SEP> Nice song
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!
Five Stars <SEP> Great music!!!!!
Okay but not what I expected <SEP> I thought this was going to be a comeback song for her but instead it just leaves you disappointed. I think her music career is done. Good luck acting.
"just couldn't get into to it <SEP> Never quite struck a chord with me. Which is rare for a R Kelly song. I didn't relate to the song. I never think of it when I'm in the mood for music, for me is very often."
One Star <SEP> Bought the song and wouldn't download
very Kool <SEP> I like this one more than the others I heard. It sounds like a real cat ...Thank you and your cat.
Love it <SEP> Cannot beat Andre.  He is great
All the music choices were poor for a CD that's meant to help you meditate <SEP> The music is far too loud for this to work as a mediation. All the music choices were poor for a CD that's meant to help you meditate.
Love <SEP> Love
"Love to listen to this group!!! <SEP> I would definitely recommend this album to everyone. Listen to them everyday and would 24/7, if I could. They ROCK!"
Better Dig Two ~ AWESOME!!!! <SEP> Still learning my Kindle fire and downloading these songs are fast and easy!  Plus the music itself is AWESOME!!!  Band Perry is new to me but I'll definitely look for .more of their music. Gotta try um!
"Great live EP <SEP> I love this EP. Halestorm sounds amazing live. I wish there was a DVD available of the performance. Just have to watch on YouTube, I guess."
"Beautiful Music! <SEP> Beautiful and relaxing music!
Go on You Tube and you can listen to some of the songs.
Relax.....and while doing all this, enjoy a nice glass of wine."
Two Stars <SEP> meh
"Rhett and Link are awesome! <SEP> This is such a funny song! You have to watch the music video! They are so creative! Find the differences, plus you get to see Rhett in a tutu!"
Great song <SEP> This is a great song for a wedding as it is timeless in the meaning of it's words! True love
Ill Wayne takes the cake again <SEP> Pretty much just like the Lil Wayne part.  But he makes any song hes on.
"Won't download to the Amazon music app <SEP> Love this song but I'll have to get it somewhere else. I bought it here, but it won't download to the Amazon music app. It shows as unpurchased. Waste of money."
great song from great ablum by great musician <SEP> great song.  he thinks he's people is a fantastic album.  rob crow is a genius.  if youve listened to any crow before you won't be disappointed with this.
Great Covers <SEP> This was a perfect gift for my husband as he loves Guitar Hero and Vitamin String Quartet.
Rasta flavored pasta for two. <SEP> Old Marquee...
"Love this! <SEP> I love this song!  I ran across it on the web about a year ago, so have been listening to it there.  It's nice to be able to download a copy so I can add to my regular music."
Five Stars <SEP> I love it.
"LEVIATHAN <SEP> From the first note of the first track, to the last note of the last track, Leviathan delivers.
It delivers, unpacks, and sets up in your livingroom.
What has been heard cannot be unheard.  I now need to have music blasted into my head no matter where I go or what I am doing.  I am terrified that any silence in my life will be an opportunity for this insipid noise to creep back into my head.  Like a bad case of herpes, it cannot be dismissed!!
Why, oh why did I listen to Leviathan in its entirety?  Why does one look at a car accident?  Why does one watch horror movies?
My musical sensibilities have been forever altered!
Thanks"
Classic! <SEP> I love Aerosmith.  Thats all there is to it.  To me anything that any of them touch is golden.  Cant wait for the new album.
"Doesn't grab, but it grows on ya. <SEP> While the opening almost sounds a little awkward, it also starts of very LOUD (even for Aerosmith). On my first listen, it honestly didn't really hook me, but after giving it a chance and going back to it a few times, it does have a certain vibe. While ""Legendary Child"" most definitely isn't my FAVORITE Aerosmith song thus far, it's actually not bad. Again, once you get past that first impression.
Paying attention to the lyrics (posted online all over the place, by now), you notice a nod to ""Walk This Way"" (""I took a chance at the high school dance, never knowin' wrong from right""). Overall, it seems to mostly be a song that says, ""Wow, I can't believe where we are now, when ya look at where we started.""
Overall, it's a decent song, definitely not bad. Though by Aerosmith's usual standards, I don't see it being a huge hit, either. As of this writing, it's charting at #29 on Billboard's ""Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks"" chart, but if it goes much higher, it'll only be because it's the first new song, from an all-new album, in about a decade. That said, I'm pretty sure there's at least one ""hit"" on the album, and quite possibly more. But we'll have to wait until either the album comes out, or more singles are released.

It's not their best, but ""Legendary Child"" isn't bad, by any stretch."
"Somethings got a hold on me <SEP> This son also skips, in several places throughout the song.  Great song, was really looking forward to it.  In  turn I decided to purchase the cd."
Horrible music choice <SEP> The background music was distracting and felt cult-y. I was shocked they used such odd music for something I assumed would be soothing.
"Neither God nor Jesus is Mentioned <SEP> This is a beautiful song, however, the name of God, nor the Lord Jesus is not mentioned one time. I consider this a beautiful song but not a gospel song. But that's just me. It seems like something appropriate to AA 12-Step program which acknowledges  a ""higher power."""
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song! !
Great Together <SEP> Love both of these artists and they are great together.  Can't wait till they tour so I can see them live.  It's gonna be a great show.
"Not the Best Version <SEP> I saw Beth Hart sing this song on a show from the Kennedy Center paying tribute to Buddy Guy and I hoped that this would be as good. It is NOT. Beth plays with the notes way too much and parts of the song are much too dragged out. I hate this version, actually. She has an amazing voice and I wish I was able to hear more of the song before I bought it because there were other versions that I could have chosen."
Beth Hart - I'd Rather Go Blind <SEP> Beth and Joe did a Yeoman's job on this old cllassic... Beth had her way with this tune and Joe followed suit........

"Five Stars <SEP> One of Ja Rule's best records, showing off his ability to write and produce."
Five Stars <SEP> beautiful voice!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Can't stop listening to this song.
I love his voice <SEP> Yaasss! This boy can sing. I love his voice. It's different but pleasant. You can even hear a tiny hint of an accent which is cool.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!!!....
Five Stars <SEP> great song
"Not the version of the song I wanted. <SEP> I bought this song using the Android app. I played it and it's a bad remake of the original version. It says ""Remastered"", not ""Remade"". With the Android app you can only play a snippet of the song, and with this it was mostly instrumental."
"I first heard this song on Pandora and searched for ... <SEP> I first heard this song on Pandora and searched for it until I found it!!! Geez, how I wish they could give lessons to some of the newer artist....."
"No background vocals!!! <SEP> The description says that this version is WITH background vocals. I downloaded it and there are no background vocals with it, only music."
Five Stars <SEP> Great singer. Love the song
Five Stars <SEP> Thank you for my order I listen to it almost everyday
Five Stars <SEP> Love this bluesy tune....the best / of Wings.
Great Product <SEP> Great Product
Thanks Amazon <SEP> I was recently introduced to this artist and I am really enjoying his music. It was recommended to me based on a purchase I made. Thanks Amazon!
"Blue eyed, white chocolate <SEP> There's so much to say about Daley..OMG WHERE TO START?! He has such voice control, and range! There isn't a day that goes by that I don't listen to him. Am so loving the talent that is coming out of the UK"
Five Stars <SEP> Great Music
Refreshing new voice <SEP> I love this song and I love the artist.  I first heard Daley with Marsha Ambrosius and had to find out more about him. His voice changes from song to song and that is a good thing.  Game Over is great but my favorite track is Love is a Losing Game.  Daley is a great artist and I can't wait to hear more from him.
One Star <SEP> The download was to bad the recording play to fast.
PRETTY COOL. <SEP> PANDORA GIVES SONGS THAT WERE NOT HITS ON THE RADIO. PRETTY COOL.
I am enjoying the music as I work out. <SEP> My favorite song.
"Up and Coming <SEP> I really enjoy this paring, Daley and Jessie J. They are both very talented and I hope to hear more from them both."
"Its ok. <SEP> I like this song, but its not one of the best. It reminds me of the 80's mix that is still stuck in the 80's. Don't get me wrong, I like the 80's but there were those 80's songs that are stuck in the 80's and should stay there. Definitely not a favorite of mine."
Four Stars <SEP> very nice not as good as dos pajaros de un tiro but very good
One Star <SEP> horrible
Great One <SEP> I haven't like Kelly's music since she won AI but since she has come over to country she is much better and I love this song.
"Kelly just keeps getting better and better. <SEP> The best move Kelly ever made was to lose Clive Davis.  She is an awesome song writer and singing artist and knows what the public wants to hear.  Her song ""Stronger"" is an anthem for so many causes...as it should be.  I'll always be a fan."
"I wish you could actually HEAR the FEMALE in the FEMALE version.... <SEP> I have to guess that the male singer is not actually PSY, but this guy kinda sucks, so if it was catchy I was thinking about getting anyway - but each sample (pretty much) cuts off before you have any idea of what the female sounds like.  One sample completely before she even starts singing..."
"Catchy song <SEP> My students like it, and they are improving on their doubles plus one facts already!"
Barely references the video version. <SEP> Was searching for the version of this track featured in the classic YouTube video...the preview was not of sufficient length to reveal the fact that this version is not anything like the one I wanted.
"oooooohhhhhh.. <SEP> My kids love this song.....'to tell santa to GO AWAY', jajaja jajaja frikken squidward is great...and spongebon jolly as usual."
"Get this CD and enjoy some good old Zydeco/Funk <SEP> fun, dynamic and funky as hell, and most of all the lyrics are clear and understandable.  Still waiting to see him live in portland or."
Five Stars <SEP> R I p
Five Stars <SEP> UT Band at its best.
"Beautiful and so relaxing and I hear this song <SEP> Beautiful and so relaxing and I hear this song, actually I hear the entire album of the Secret Garden over and over in my head.  I have heard a tune before keep repeating in my head but never an entire album!  This is truly a work of art and so beautiful to listen to! :)  I love this song."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it.
Five Stars <SEP> Great!!
It really delivers the goods! <SEP> A dream come true!
"DO NOT BUY!! <SEP> The :30 preview for the song makes the voices sound decent, however, in the whole song they sound terrible. I don't know who they hired to sing this, but I was massively disappointed and couldn't bear to listen to it fully a second time. If you're planning on using this for your wedding, DON'T. And who doesn't have a friend/s that could sing it for them. Much better and more personal. In fact that's why I got the recording, to practice for my friends wedding. But I don't want to sound like a dying cat, so I found better recordings on YouTube to practice with."
boooo! <SEP> Its freakn horrible its not even the whole song i could of just listened to the preview over and over if i wanted to hear that. Im going to ask for a refund!
"*sigh* <SEP> It is not at all what I was expecting to hear. I wanted to dance, and nded up falling asleep. Lame!"
love it <SEP> who can't love kelly clarkson...and throw in vince...it's a hit
"sweet stuff <SEP> Wow. Fat Jon continues to impress. This album is a little different than his usual sounds. The fisrt 5 tracks are more smooth and jazzy. Might catch some fans off guard but its a nice surprise. Track 6 ""losing you"" goes back to his usual hard funky groovy sound and the remainder of the album maintains that feel. For me most of the tracks require listening to multiple times. It sounds that good. Its hard to imagine anyone not liking this music. It transcends genres in my opinion. Its also hard to believe music can sound this good. Fat Jon is simply a musical mastermind, whether he's Maurice Galactica, Ample soul physician or Beautiful Killing Machine. I can't wait until his next album and I hope he never stops making music. I need it!"
I'm disappointed. <SEP> I thought this was music.  Its just testimony.  I'm disappointed.
"My opinion <SEP> I am a Doo Wop collector. I like Doo Wop. In remembrance of the Good Old Days this song,  In my opinion, is worth 4 stars."
"Love it! <SEP> Love this song!!! I have no complaints at all. Very professional soundtrack and if you buy this, trust me; you will not be disappointed what so ever! No better way in supporting my favorite youtubers! Love you guys!"
This song is boss <SEP> I love this song!:) I would definitely recommend this song to Smosh lover's but also people who people who love assassins creed 3! I love because I'm a huge Smosh fan!:)
Two Stars <SEP> Seems to be sung by a foreign singer with much less talent than Adam Levine.
airbourne rocks <SEP> this is a great metal cd if you like bands like airbourne i bought the cd and was totally hooked i would highly recommend this!!!!!!!!!!
Christmas Eve Jitters <SEP> This is a fun song for children. The music is really cute and made us laugh. I highly recommend this song.
"Wrong question <SEP> The creators of the Martyrs Prayers ask the wrong question.  As an Orthodox Christian, many of the saints in this project are the saints of my church.  The question for real Christians is not what will you die for, but rather who will you live for.  The crucifixion and the murders of the martyrs were small amounts of secular time when Satan had the upper hand.  True believers focus their attention on the Resurrection and understand that the teachings of the church's martyrs resonate for an eternity.  We Orthodox study the lives of the Saints not their deaths.  Anyone who truly understood the iconography of Christian art would know not to surround the cross with black as was done on this CD cover.  Black is the symbol of death but all Orthodox Christians know that Christ lives and so do all believers who were martyred.  The theological mess of this CD is what happens when a couple of Protestants try to explain something they know only on an intellectual secular level because they do not understand the original Christian church or its theology.  Listening to this CD is akin to listening to a couple of toddlers trying to explain calculus.  Bell and Arnold should quit trying to make money off a religion to which they do not belong and a truth they do not understand."
"An Unusual and Unexpected Pleasure <SEP> I really had no idea how this would work out, but it turned out to be wonderful.  The music fits the words of the prayers.  The prayers were thoughtfully chosen.  It was indeed great!  And it turns out that I remember Michael Glen Bell from days at Buena Vista College."
Unsure of what this item is. <SEP> I didn't order this item.  Someone else is possibly using my account.  How is this possible when no one knows my password.
"Very unhappy buyer <SEP> I purchased this based on assumption that this is royalty free ""music on hold"" MP3s. There is usually a license agreement which identifies any restrictions on use, but I have not been able to find anything of that type. The copyright guys at Amazon will not provide any support or clarification, just telling me to ""look on the internet""  for them. Since ""Music on Hold"" is a generic name and does not seem to the name of a real vendor or publisher,there is no way to contact them to request clarification or documentation. So  I still don't know if this music can be used for business or is would still be subject to ASCAP or BMI scrutiny.

I'm a good Amazon customer who is very unhappy about the purchase and Amazon's lack of support.  I would like a refund but cant even contact the vendor to request, and Amazon refuses to assist, At this point, I strongly recommend against anyone doing business with this vendor if you need to know the copyright status of the music you purchase."
great on hold song <SEP> Perfect on hold music. Amazon wants more words but this song is perfect for our use. Good to calm the customer
"Re:  Excellent <SEP> If there is such a thing as Southern Gospel in your DNA I have it and the Cathedrals are about the best of the best.  Three of them are now with the Lord and, to be honest, I cannot wait to get to Heaven and just sit and listen to them, and all of the other greats that are already there, for eternity.  Roger Bennett's testimony, even though we know how it ultimately ends, on this is inspiring.  And, that continued to be his attitude until the Lord called him home."
"A treasure chest of little - and big- gems <SEP> I bought this by mail from Warner Bros. records back in the day, it's one of their music samplers. I played this set to death! It contained works from many artists that were on the brink of really breaking out - Todd Rungren, Fleetwood Mac, Alice Cooper, Seals & Crofts, Bonnie Raitt, Halfnelson (later to become Sparks) - and got me to discover and appreciate established artists like Alan Toussaint, Malo and Captain Beefheart. Interspersed are bits of old radio show themes and intros. T-Rex ""Bang a Gong"", Faces' ""Memphis"", and Alice Coopers ""Be My Lover"" are the show-stoppers in this delightful mix."
Awesome track!! <SEP> I freaking LOVE this tune. Solid production and a great price. This tune always gets the dancefloor jumping when i play it. Nice!!
"wrong item <SEP> I got the Cd but was only the artist cover, the Cd was from an other artist !!!!!!"
"wrong purchase <SEP> If you are not sure the title of the music, you better check first!  I was going to purchase Fall out Boys but somehow end up with this one...."
Killer stuff <SEP> Love this big time. I have been following myndset for a while now. his first single is awesome! Yeah! Great! AWesome! Buy Now!!!!!
I think this is one of his most underrated songs <SEP> I think this is one of his most underrated songs. Listen to the change of tempo 3/4 in. It's a rare talent that can pull that off and Luther was it!
"old Hawaii <SEP> I use to listen to thus song all the time when I was a kid. Now that I live in the nsinland, it's hard to find Hawaiian music. I love that I'm able to listen to Wahine Ilikea and share it with my kids."
"Wrong Song <SEP> This is the wrong song. This is Close To You, the song before it/"
"How do I return this? <SEP> This recording is incomplete! I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please tell me how I get rid of this piece of junk.
Don't do it."
Not full version of song! <SEP> This is not the full version of the song!  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvtAqGp0slo
"Great song! <SEP> Dire Straits has so many unknown songs that should be known! I never understood why they didn't play on the radio, so much better than their commercial stuff"
Five Stars <SEP> Great Product AAAA++++
"Quality music <SEP> Some of the best experimental progressive math rock that will ever grace your ears! If you're a drummer, you need to hear this."
One Star <SEP> I did not intend to buy it 3 times
"I Wanna Love This Song...but it's the Remix <SEP> It was my intentions to purchase the original version that does not feature Busta Rhymes. If Amazon had included the word ""Remix"" in the title of the product, it would have been clear that this was not the original version and I wouldn't have selected it. I don't know if the original version is available on Amazon, but it features much more of Robin's wonderful vocals. Nevertheless, it has a nice beat and I'm still a fan."
NOT BY HURTS. <SEP> This is not by the band HURTS.  It's an Asian Group.  Buyer beware.
"Badass!!! <SEP> I've been looking for this track for a couple of years and finally got the Amazon Mp3 app.  Boo-ya, Cochina!"
Power pop-punk <SEP> This is a great collection of fresh power-pop/punk songs. The lyrics are fun and the songs all have catchy hooks. The songs combine edgy and interesting guitar work with good melodies and harmonies. The best song comes free with the album! Perfect summertime rock!
"One of their BEST songs!!! <SEP> Not as epic as Epica, but still good enough to include in your playlist."
"epic song! <SEP> Sands of Time is a great song, that is one of the best by Audiomachine that I've heard.
It has that dramatic movie feel with a strong ending. I have nothing bad to say about this track.
I recommend it to anyone that enjoys listening to epic music like this."
"ooh wee <SEP> this is a jam that is so bluesy and we love the blues here, this is the only jam i like from him, what a piece of work this is.(smile)"
"Wrong song <SEP> This is Pt 2, not Pt 1"
Excellent cut <SEP> This song hits a sweet spot for Shinedown.  My son turned me onto the band and they are quickly becoming a favorite.  This cut did not disappoint me at all.
"Mandre before the aliens <SEP> Andre Lewis's works of art have been outstanding! Maxayn: Bail Out for Fun (the entire album) is a must! But until then, there's this jewl!"
xmas is cpming <SEP> can't wait for christmas light show 2014  lights will dance to the music and we will collect food for charity
Disappointing! <SEP> I thought I was getting something else by Cee Lo but still disappointed in this cut as a smooth jazz listener.
great zydeco song <SEP> great song it really have a good beat to it very good zydeco song keeps u on your feet moving at all times
Nice crooning song <SEP> Nice melody. I hear this from time to time on the radio but not nearly enough so I had to buy it. I have about 50 songs on my music wish list.  I picked this one out of 50 others to purchase so it must be good.
Awesome <SEP> I love great beats! Perfect for me to listen to in my Honda with my speakers. Very loud and bumps.
"One Star <SEP> bad souind, had to delet the song"

Love this one <SEP> I love listening to the Collingsworth family and this song quickly became one of my favorites. Listen to it often.
Great dance tune. <SEP> Great dance tune.
this is the place <SEP> ministry; this song is ministry and we all need to be ministered to and iths is one to stast the day with thanks Deac!
"Cry Baby song clean lyrics but music all choppy <SEP> Not a good version music-wise. Also did not like the album cover which said ""explicit lyrics."" I got the clean lyrics version. It was clean lyrics nut choppy music. I will delete."

"Amazing album <SEP> This is one of the most beautiful albums I have heard in a very long time. I recently discovered Aloe Blacc from listening to his hip  hop material as part of the duo Emanon (Aloe Blacc and Exile). I was very impressed with his rapping ability and his conscious message. However, I had no idea this guy could actually sing as well. After listening to his break out single, ""I need a dollar"" from the album Good Things, I was amazed. When I heard this guy sing in spanish then play the trumpet, I realized he was special.

This album showcases his superb talents with a Caribbean and Latin back drop.
-Impressive from beginning to end.
-No filler, No BS. Just beautiful music from the first to the last track.

Roseaux represents an Aloe Blacc who has completely reinvented himself and perfected his new style as a multitalented soulful vocalist.

Amazing album."
"Expect more from Das <SEP> CD isn't the same raw underground you would come to expect from a Das Efx member.  Drayz isn't terrible, but its hardly what I want from this group.  Just isn't the same without the duo taking turns melting your mind with that iggidy metaphor."
Two Stars <SEP> ok
"Movie was OK but this song is great <SEP> buy this song if you are huge QOSTA fan and Josh Homme like me. I like the bridge and chorus of this song, its got a real flow to it and its a great song."
"its got 5 stars <SEP> I hate being forced to write reviews. I love josh home, this is a new song with him singing. 5 stars"
Nah <SEP> Not what I was expecting. Horrible music and bad sound. Did regret buying it. Too bad I cannot return it.
Four Stars <SEP> 0k
"Great Song <SEP> I have been searching for this song for a long time and I was so glad to find it here for 99c.  A great song, and she was still in high school when she recorded this album."
"A NICE COVER OF ""I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS"" <SEP> This is a nice classic cover of ""I'll Be Home For Christmas.""  John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John sound really good together, and they are backed up by a full, lush orchestra.  I would recommend this download!"
Why Bother? <SEP> Barbra Streisand is the only saving grace on this track.  Travolta and Newton-John don't have the magic they had in 'Grease' and never should have ventured on this project.
Five Stars <SEP> CLEAN- GOOD LINE DANCE  MUSIC
"Like everyone else <SEP> Like everyone else, I didn't realize this was just the music when I purchased it, and I think it's wrong.  Nowhere do I see it described as being only instrumental!  What a jip!"
not so much <SEP> Didn't realize it was a purely instrumental single at $9+ and not a great one at that.
This was NOT the Song by Fun <SEP> This was just a piano version. SUCKED Pissed I wasted money on it.  Deleted it within 10 seconds of hearing it.
"Piano Instrumental Disappointment <SEP> This was the only Carry on song by Fun, found on Amazon MP3. There was NO indication it was a piano instrumental...WTF? 4 minutes and .89 cents I will never give back."
GAH misleading <SEP> I wanted the actual version and didn't catch that the title and artist were reversed. Almost as bad as the one time I downloaded another song that was nothing more than a loop of the chorus. Frankly the people who release these songs are parasites in the worst way. Don't buy!
Clearly a scam <SEP> THIS IS NOT CARRY ON by FUN.  Don't buy it.  This is a pathetic attempt by the author to make money by taking advantage of people who are not searching carefully.
"This version is just a piano version, not the full production.  Almost a karoke <SEP> This version is just a piano version, not the full production.  Almost a karoke, but not quite.  No what I wanted."
Five Stars <SEP> Great voice and good music.
ummm instrumental version?? <SEP> This version of carry on has no words... nowhere does it say that so I just wasted $1.29 I guess? Weird. The music's nice but geez
"Carry On by Fun <SEP> Don't buy this unless you want only melody, there were no lyrics at all.  Plus you have to download it to Cloud Player and I still haven't figured out how to get it on Windows Media Player."
NOT that song... <SEP> DONT CLICK THIS as it is not FUN (nor fun)...a buck for the melody...not the group and their hit that I was stunted by in Grammy's.  Get SOME NiGHTS version.
"Misleading! <SEP> Piano only.  I thought I was buying the song ""Carry On"" by Fun.  You have to look close to see that this is labeled as the song ""Fun"" by the group ""carry on"".  Lousy trick, and not what I thought I was getting."
"Instrumental <SEP> This is an instrumental version and nowhere is that in the description!  Maybe a problem with Amazon, or just my download?"
"Instrumental version! <SEP> I am disappointed that no where does it say this is the instrumental version only!  Buyer, beware!  The song is still good but not what I thought it was."
Five Stars <SEP> good memories
Two Stars <SEP> was not aware that item was not formatted for U.S. equip
"If you're a Gg fan, must have this one. <SEP> Past paced, excellent arrangement, piano mainly featured, but as usual nicely woven with the band. Wasn't aware Gordon could move his fingers this fast. Good Show!"
Awesomeness <SEP> Very satisfied.
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
"The original soundtrack! <SEP> What a delight to find all the original music from opening theme to closing credits! This is great instrumental music, some of which can be included in your holiday music mixes if you are so inclined."
"Four letter words.... <SEP> This song is Uncle Kracker and his personality all the way ! I love it , it ranks right up there with Follow Me in my book! A great song in all !"
Five Stars <SEP> Love Aaron Lewis' voice! HAPPY he sings country now too!
"Stunning Soundtrack <SEP> Assassin's Creed games always have an incredible storyline.  The music of each game has been top notch since the original Assassin's Creed game.  I currently own the Assassin's Creed II and III soundtracks in their entirety along with select tracks from the others in the series.  Jesper Kyd and Lorne Balfe are both extremely talented and composed pieces that reflected the emotions, actions and cultures in the game very well.  Seeing that Liberation was composed by a new composer to the series, Winifred Phillips, made me skeptical as to whether I would enjoy it.

I played through the samples to see if it would be of interest to me.  It captured my attention so I ended up purchasing the full soundtrack and am very pleased that I did.  Aveline's story was filled with many different cultures (African-French descent, Lousiana and Mexico locations, Spanish overtaking New Orleans in the 1700s) so the composer had to find a way to mix all of this in to one cohesive soundtrack which she did beautifully.  She made it unique for the character, but managed to make it still sound like an Assassin's Creed soundtrack.

Typically I listen to the AC soundtrack's while working because I find they help me focus and also inspire me while coding. This album has been a great addition to that playlist.

I highly recommend this album.

Agate's Power, Aveline's Escape, and the Liberation theme were my favorites of the album."
"pass on it. <SEP> The good: They play their instruments well; they are mostly on key. The are sincere in their efforts.
The bad: Several of the words are wrong, and some pronunciations are wrong... like 'rick-oh-shett"" . Singing a few wrong words and using wrong pronunciations may seem like a little thing but listening to it repeated over and over, grinds on the  listener's ears. I deleted it."
Five Stars <SEP> A++++
"Great Chillin Song <SEP> Added this to our boating CD.  Nice beat, and I like the premise that goes so well with unwinding after a hard week at work!"
"The best way to describe it is just pure serenity <SEP> ""River of Stars"" touches my heart, my soul, and my mind.  The best way to describe it is just pure serenity."
One Star <SEP> Sound is not good at all. I did not like it.
"CANT MOVE THIS!!!! <SEP> IT WILL NOT LET ME MOVE THIS SONG TO ITUNES!!!!!!

IM NOT GOING TO GO TO AN AMAZON CLOUD PLAYER FOR 1 SONG I WANT ON ITUNES!!!!!!"
"Ryan Seacrest loves Lil Debbie <SEP> The beat to Michelle Obama (presidential tint) is grizzly. Lil Debbie and Riff Raff always kill it together (check out Squirt). This may be one of Lil Debbie's best tracks and Riff Raff delivers is his usual form. The freestyle scientist's features in other artist's songs have been beastly of late (check out the Illest by far east movement for maybe Riff's best yet), as he consistently puts in the effort that outstrips other artists in the rap game."
OMG LiL DEBBIE! <SEP> LiL DEBBIE really did her thing on this song. Hopefully she keeps it going like this for now on and I will definitely keep listening.
"Great Italian hits <SEP> Great Italian hits, just be aware that half of these songs are covers, not sung by the original artists."
One Star <SEP> i thought this was a collection by original artists.should have looked closer.
"Anything these guys do is great, Live is better <SEP> Chris Thile leads the pack of 5 virtuosos having the time of their life!  . Anything these guys do is great, Live is better."
"Not the real deal <SEP> I should have read into the description further.  I thought this was STP singing when I initially purchased, not some tribute band.  It's my fault for not reading into it further.
Make sure you read all the details before press that purchase button!!!"
"Beautiful Noise <SEP> Handsome, talented trio!"
hard beats and rhymes <SEP> gutter flows and westcoast flavor W rocks the mic swiftly and delivers on point. Original Rose Town reppin full of witty ad libs and metaphors that will keep the party jumpin!
"One of my favorite song <SEP> As long as u r a fan of Wanting, u should not miss this song. I purchase it because of it is a bonus song and it deserves to have a high quality version by paying $1.29.  U'll love it!"
"Five Stars <SEP> I love this album, only wish I could get it on CD."
"Not one bad song on the whole record. <SEP> A perfect record I can listen to all the way through - not a bad song on the whole album. This is real music made by extremely talented musicians. At times pop-ish, at times poetic, at times all-out acid rock. But always original."
Uneven sound <SEP> I used to have this LP during the turbulant 60's Budget price of course. Gibbs sounds like he is playing xylophone and with Burrell's overamplified guitar it did not make for good listening.  I don't know how the CD sounds.
"Terry Reid is an underrated singer, any classic rock ... <SEP> Terry Reid is an underrated singer, any classic rock fan should own this and seed of memory by Terry!"
"Outstanding <SEP> Absolutly loved this album when I was a kid. I haven't listened to it in years mainly because I can playback every track in detail in my head. Its that good. Somewhere along the line my brothers and I lost the album to eternity so I thought Id get a copy on vinyl for my kids.  Holy inflation Batman! My Dad got his from a bargain bin for 50 cents. Middle Eastern Rock is good but not $159 or even $86 good especially if you have the tracks memorized. On the other hand, its one of the great fusion albums and very reflective of its time. Might be worth it under the right circumstances."
AWESOME CD <SEP> This is a great album. I had it when I was a teen. Found it in a cd on E-Bay. Can not wait to receive it. If you like these artists you will love them together.
Five Stars <SEP> wonderful
"FATS On THE 88'S <SEP> A super reissue of all his piano solos for RCA VICTOR. It's nice to have them all in one spot.  Vintage series may be in better sound ,but I found this baby SEALED."
"First Of 4 LPs By Prolific Country Hit-Writer Sonny Throckmorton <SEP> Much like Country singer/songwriter Bill Rice, there was a lot more to Sonny Throckmorton (born James Fron Throckmorton in Carlsbad, New Mexico on April 2, 1941) than his own quite modest commercial results as a performer, starting with the facts that he's been the recipient of Songwriter Of The Year Award from both the Nashville Songwriters Association International and Broadcast Music Incorporated, and has been inducted into The Nashville Songwriter's Hall Of Fame (1985). Which is hardly surprising when you look at this list of just come of his compositions, mostly done for Tree Publishing in Texas:

The Cowboy Rides Away - 1985 # 5 for George Strait; Friday Night Blues - 1980 # 2 for John Conlee; How Long Has It Been? - 1966 # 6 for Bobby Lewis; I Feel Like Loving You Again - 1981 # 1 for T. G. Sheppard; I Wish I Was Eighteen Again - 1979 # 18 ""follow-along"" hit for Jerry Lee Lewis and 1980 # 15 (and # 49 Pop)for the venerable George Burns; I Wish You Could Have Turned My Head (And Left My Heart Alone) - 1981 # 54 for Peggy Foran and 1981 # 2 for The Oak Ridge Boys; I'm Knee Deep In Loving You - 1976 # 86 for Jim Mundy and 1977 # 2 for Dave & Sugar; If We're Not Back In Love By Monday - 1977 # 2 by Merle Haggard; It's A Cheating Situation - 1979 # 2 for Moe Bandy; Last Cheater's Waltz - 1979 # 1 for T.G. Sheppard; Middle Age Crazy - 1978 # 4 for Jerry Lee Lewis; She Can't Say That Anymore - 1980 # 2 for John Conlee; Smooth Sailin' - 1978 # 68 for Connie Smith and 1980 # 6 for T.G. Sheppard; Stand Up - 1985 # 5 for Mel McDaniel; Thinkin' Of A Rendezvous - 1976 # 1 for Johnny Duncan; Trying To Love Two Women - 1980 # 1 for The Oak Ridge Boys; The Way I Am - 1980 # 2 for Merle Haggard; What I Had With You - 1980 # 48 for Sheila Andrews with Joe Sun and 1981 # 12 for John Conlee; Why Not Me - 1984 # 1 for The Judds; You Feel Good All Over - 1979 # 4 for T.G. Sheppard.

Unfortunately, also like Rice, there is no CD compilation of his own recorded sides which produced these 8 nationally-charting singles from late 1976 to late 1981: Rosie - # 76 Sept 1976 b/w Troublesome Waters (Starcrest 073); Lovin' You, Lovin' Me - # 73 Dec 1976-Jan 1977 b/w I Don't Know How To Tell Her (She Don't Love My Anymore) (Starcrest 094); his own renditions of I Wish You Could Have Turned My Head (And Left My Heart Alone) - # 54 Sept-Oct 1978 b/w She Sure Makes Leavin' Look Easy (Mercury 55039) and Smooth Sailin' - # 47 Feb 1979 b/w Last Cheater's Waltz - # 47 ""follow-along"" (Mercury 55051); Can't You Heart That Whistle Blow? - # 66 July 1979 b/w I Feel Like Loving You Again (Mercury 57061); his own rendition of Friday Night Blues - # 89 April 1980 b/w It Always rains On Me (Mercury 57018); and A Girl Like You - # 77 Dec 1981 b/w I've Broken My Own Heart (MCA 51214).

All we have at our disposal are scattered used copies of 45-rpm discs and the LP covered here, his first, titled ""The Last Cheater's Waltz"" (Mercury SRM-1-3736) released in August 1978 containing: 1. I Wish You Could Have Turned My Head (and Left My Heart Alone); 2. The Last Cheater's Waltz; 3. I'm Knee Deep In Loving You; 4. Middle Age Crazy; 5. She Sure Makes Leavin' Look Easy; 6. Smooth Sailin'; 7. If We're Not Back In Love By Monday; 8. I Feel Like Loving You Again; 9. I'm Turning You Loose Again; 10. Drink It Down Lady.

It's high-time someone produced a definitive Sonny Throckmorton 20-25 track CD anthology encompassing all sides of his 8 charting songs along with selected album cuts and non-charting singles."
"Deeper Indeed! <SEP> True to it's title, this album pulls us even deeper and ushers us into God's presence with every track.  Christine's voice and heart-felt devotion shine through.  Here are gems, such as Father of mine, which are both delicate and powerful expressions of  devotion.  A great album for all who want to go deeper in God."
Brings back memories <SEP> Had FCA when i was a kid it's great
Great song <SEP> Oldie but a goodie
I Know <SEP> I Know by the Collingsworth Family.  A beautiful song sung by a great family.  They are all very talented. I don't know a lot about them but the songs I've heard are all very well done.
Neil Young's Born in Ontario <SEP> I probably like this for 2 reasons.  I live near Ontaro and this man's music and writing is SO good it's worthh it to buy
Two Stars <SEP> Way too many birds
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful song!
"Surprisingly Good!!! <SEP> After stumbling across one of their videos and surprisingly I really liked Nikki's voice.  She can actually sing and is not riding on the coattails of her husband!!!

The songs are really good and you can feel their love for one another as they weave their vocal tapestries together.  The music itself fits perfectly. It's real, it has meaning and most importantly, it's not some stupid retread, soulless pop sound that they tried to force on us because she's got the bigger name.

There is a purity to Nikki's voice that I really like, an element to it that captures you, or at least me.  She doesn't try to do too much, she just sings.

I really like this EP and hope that they will have more music for us in the future.  Well done you two!!!"
Two Stars <SEP> If you like nonstop bird calls...
One Star <SEP> It was not what i was looking for. Wanted the original songs.
"TOTAL RIP OFF - ONLY 30 SECONDS LONG! <SEP> This is a rip off and I have complained to Amazon and got a refund. When it says it is an introduction, it literally is. She introduces herself and says what she does and what she can help you with and then it ends!!! NOTHING WORTHWHILE OR HELPFUL ON HERE AT ALL, BASCIALLY JUST ADVERTISMENT."
Five Stars <SEP> To hear read send chills down your spine
Love <SEP> Love it. Enough said.
Five Stars <SEP> FABULOUS!!!!!
"Good sound loop <SEP> Good sound loop. I used it as the background for a 15 min slideshow for a Cub Scout graduation ceremony, and it worked very well. Configured it to loop as the track is shorter than the slideshow. Overall it worked out very well, and added some nice ambience to the start of our ceremony. The parents really liked it as well."
Great music! <SEP> One of the best songs ever!  Keep up the gold work!
I love the Backstreet Boys <SEP> I love anything from Backstreet Boys and this song puts me right in the Christmas spirit! This has become one of my favorites for the season.
"A song that grows on you <SEP> When I first heard this song I didn't think it was going to be one of my favorite BSB songs.  The more I listened to it the more I liked it.  I would tell any BSB fan to get this song.  Even if you don't really like it at first, it might grow on you."
Holding on to the promises <SEP> Holding on to the promises is what the Christian is all about. I do hold on to the promise of eternal life. I know nothing can separate me from God's love.
"typical  Sanctus Real <SEP> I fell in love with their music a few years back and really enjoy their combination of music and message.  The words are easy to understand/hear as they are not drown out with the music like so many of today's songs are.

As the title implies, it's about the promises of the bible and not giving up when it seems that the world and life are totally against you.  While the message is ageless, the promises ring just as true today as they did in ancient times, as it seems the entire world is going down the drain in a hand basket.

This song will not disappoint you at all."
Five Stars <SEP> Thank you!
One Star <SEP> Not the version I wanted
spiritually meaningful <SEP> awesome and meaningful song love it
Pray-Sanctus Real-Exceptional <SEP> beautiful lyrics-inspirational worship. Helpful and encouraging when you are going through tough times or just having an average day. exceptional!
"Linda, Dolly and Emmylou! <SEP> All in one aristically packaged set! You can't go wrong with these three. Its a shame that they didn't record more music!"
"Cannot figure websight or contact Amazon <SEP> I bought this mp3 album and could not download it. I clicked on everything I could find at amazon but could not get help and I could not cancel and get my money back. Amazon has removed anything on the web sight that can help one in the mess I am in.  I recommend against buying any mp3s
from Amazon"
"Several tracks are missing audio <SEP> The one-star does not reflect the quality of the performance.  I find the arrangements and vocals to be exquisite.  The problem is in the recording itself.  Several tracks, like track 14, there is no audio after 0:48 mark.  Obviously a transcoding issue of some kind.  I found streaming services have the same defect.  A real shame."
"Extremly creative and crushing album <SEP> First off, how in the world did the guitar player get that crushing and thick sound and tone to his music? That has to be one of the best metal guitar sounds next to Eidolon's Glen Drover. This album is very creative, including straightforward pounding songs mixed with a dash of technical and progressive flair. The short into and spoken word interludes add dimension and atmosphere to an already darkly themed album. The singing in very much in the style on traditional and classic metal, with a balance of powermetal prowess. Add a solid and tight rhythm section of drums and bass and this album delivers one hell of a ride through a twisted landscape of music. Highly recommended for music enthisiasts who are looking for a band that isn't afraid to take chances and get creative!"
"ROCK AND ROLL ANGST AT ITS BEST <SEP> Everyday Grace is Thread's first full-length album and it captures them at the peak of their creativity. The heavy guitar riffs and dark harmonies that made them a popular live act in the 90's Seattle music scene are present on songs like Ethan, Believe and Arise. However, other sounds emerge that show off this trio's solid musicianship and extremely broad influences. From Window's country twang to Forty's upbeat infectious rhythm, Everyday Grace is a unique find, a collection of great songs that hold up in any era. Released: Aug 01, 1994  1994 Thread

  ""We were in seattle during the bomb of the seattle sound...it was all around us...in the water...in the air...in our veins"" - Rocky

 ""Scott was a great guitarist/great producer/and a great person. Brian was the solid rock in the band..A great drummer...A better guy, A sweeter guy than we deserved"" - Rocky

 ""We never wanted to sound like anyone else...but except for songs like Cinnamon, we absorbed what was around us at the time...and if we would've stayed together longer...who knows what sound we would've had"" - Rocky"

Five Stars <SEP> wonder full music.
"oh, christian music aka chris tomlin <SEP> It's a decent song... until the rapping..."
"awesome <SEP> Awesome song.  I loved the bible verses inserted in the middle of the song and the wrapping
At the end."
Great Song ! ! ! <SEP> Great Song ! ! !
"Great Worship Song <SEP> I gave it a 5 because the song spoke to me. The combination of upbeat music, the spiritual lyrics, and the voices of Chris and Christy are a combination worthy of a 5+. I would recommend to anyone."
"Five Stars <SEP> I love this song, it will get you dancing! A must have for your music list."
Five Stars <SEP> Love the song :-)
So Glad This Song Is On Amazon!! <SEP> This song is AMAZING!! Marshetta has one of the best voices in Gospel Music!!
"Mmmmm not as good as Tim and Eric <SEP> Lich King tries so hard to write thrash, when all it is is rehashed re-thrash garbage for VANS wearing skater kids.

 punk rock tostinos pizza lifestyle forever!"
Five Stars <SEP> Awesomely performed!
"A new artist never release a Christmas album to  launch his career. Jason Paul Curtis breaks the tradition and Does it good. <SEP> Fresh, young and hip. A standout in a crowd of new Jazz/Standards vocalists. His voice is exceptionally cool and easy, exactly what is much needed in the mix of younger set of crooners. If Kurt Elling is to Sarah Vaughn, Jason Paul Lewis is to Sinatra. His modern take is sending the right signals. Stardom is just a few albums away. The holiday beat blends flowing freely with his cool and easy vocals. The best holiday album of the decade so far. A MUST buy."
Soulful song with R&B feel that will move you <SEP> Great soulful song that will move you.
Four Stars <SEP> Happy with my purchase.
"Strange Zombies Stand Up! <SEP> Spaide Ripper is another one of those underground artists that doesn't get the credit he deserves...yet. Honestly, I didn't first hear of him until I heard him on Stevie Stone's ""Goin' Down"" track on ""Rollin' Stone"". Like I usually do when I hear new artists/bands that I like, I looked for more tracks with Spaide and was pleasantly surprised he wasn't just a one hit wonder.

Spaide Ripper is lyrically talented and like many of the artists he works with and does a good job with storytelling in doing so. For instance, ""Illumination"" on this album is a deep song that makes you think, but still has a good rhythm in the process. On the other spectrum, Spaide has some fun in songs like, ""Retarded"" and ""Koko Bware"" where it's up-tempo lyrical murder.

Can't wait for Zombiiie III and hope that he eventually gets signed with Strange Music because he certainly would fit in well."
"ludacris is ridiculous <SEP> same ole/same ole as all the other rapping 'music'.  No variety, uniqueness, musicality.  just trying to make a dollar with little effort."
Great. All top rate musicians <SEP> Great.  All top rate musicians.  Guthrie is awesome!
A+ <SEP> Loving this single by RuPaul's Drag Race contestants Manila Luzon (third season) and Latrice Royale (fourth season). Team Latrila was my choice to win All Stars!!!
"Different Sound for Ludacris; Would Suit Flo Rida Better <SEP> On his new single ""Rest of My Life,"" Ludacris collaborates with both David Guetta and Usher.  Usher has as of late been assimilating to pop trends in his sound so the fact that this cut sports David Guetta's typical Europop-infused sound is unsurprising.  Usher sounds solid here, maintaining his vocal refinement and playing into pop gimmickry. That said, many in R&B circles would prefer something more along the lines of more contemporary R&B aspirations from Raymond as opposed to his poppy experiments.  Even so, this cut specifically is a most different sound for Ludacris, who is more associated with a southern rap sound.

The main problem with this being a Ludacris cut is that this cut sounds more up Flo Rida's alley than Ludacris's. The guess is that Ludacris and his producers probably feel he needs a huge single in order to deliver commercially on his upcoming album having not been in the spotlight for a couple of years. David Guetta gave The Black Eyed Peas their biggest hit with ""I Gotta Feeling"" (14 weeks at no. 1), so he would be the person to deliver a big hit.  That said, Ludacris is much more of a risqu&eacute; rapper and this cut presents the MC as tame and perhaps even somewhat of a 'sellout.' His verses yield nothing truly notable here and while there is that pop sensibility, you never feel that this is where Ludacris should be going as an artist.  There is nothing wrong with shaking up your style, but ""Rest of My Life"" seems to aim more for pop aspirations as opposed to being a solid rap cut suiting what Ludacris does best.  Maybe it is a better cut than I give it credit for, but this feels completely left of center for Ludacris as an artist."
"If you like Chamberlain Waits then your going to love this <SEP> This is one of my most anticipated albums of 2012, and the first single doesn't let you down. It seems to be more of a continuation of the sound they where going in with Chamberlain Waits."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome stuff..Thanks!
"GREAT ! <SEP> Ecliptic mix of so many different music styles, there are so many songs to draw the listener in. Anyone who pops this CD on and isn't groovin doesn't know good music. PMT brings something new to the conversation of great new musicians. Lets hope he keeps bringing us new music in the future. Much love."
great song <SEP> Great song
Just keeps getting better! <SEP> Sanctus Real have produced their best record yet. Each project just keeps getting better. The bonus tracks (which I purchased on amazon) are a great comoplement to the entire album. Pick this one up friends - you'll be glad you did!
Two Stars <SEP> My review of this album is the same as Vol. 5; they both have the same problem-low bit rates.
"Yes. <SEP> This little two song EP is gorgeous. The title track brings to mind the beautiful textures of something like The Antlers ""I Don't Want Love"", and the dynamics of ""Wind Doesn't Move"" are perfectly executed. Lines about the heart, like ""It's a strong mechanism, but it's foolish at best"" (from the title track) make these songs instantly relatable. La Commission has a knack for melody, lyrics, and arrangement, and I can't wait to hear more from this artist."
Five Stars <SEP> Nice!
One Star <SEP> Every cd skipped
One Star <SEP> there's alot of tracks that prematurely skip.
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
"Great new CD! <SEP> I'm so happy to have happened upon Josh Weathers and his band on a random night out last summer.  Never before has a band made me jump out of my seat and get out on the dance floor so quickly!  If you're in the DFW area, you owe it to yourself to find out where he's playing and get out for a guaranteed good time!"
"Terry Edwards is the real thing <SEP> It doesn't take the full three minutes of a Terry Edwards song to know that he is a sensitive and articulate songwriter.  This, his latest CD, is a collection reflecting his love of his life in the mountains of North Carolina.  Ballads and up-temp tunes are rewarding experiences from the pen of an original American talent!"
Five Stars <SEP> Absolutely beautiful!
Lousy <SEP> Didn't know who Snow Presley was. Anyway an insult to Elvis.
"Just what I was looking for <SEP> I needed a track like to accompany my son's Halloween costume (he was Elvis, of course).  I wanted to play it when he entered the room.  It was just what we needed and my family loved it!"
This is an exquisite song <SEP> What a wonderful version of this song! I'm truly tempted to purchase the entire album now. It's so beautiful that I listen to it over and over again.
"Poor sound quality <SEP> Great song, but sound is awful even with ear phones.  Would recommend trying a different version of this song, live or studio."
"Lamest song ever <SEP> This is the gayest song I have ever heard.  ""Until the death of me, I'll give it everything""  Give me a break.  It was like listening to that lame ""More than Words"" song from the 90's but much worse."
"Get your gris-gris on <SEP> What a sweet collection. Blues, funky, Cajun, ..what's not to like. Great mix, and great tunes."
"Really don't like the fact that I purchased it for <SEP> Really don't like the fact that I purchased it for .99 cents only to discover it's not in my offline library. Then I pay 1.99 for the ""mp3"" album, and then discover it's not in my offline library."
"Really don't like the fact that I purchased it for <SEP> Really don't like the fact that I purchased it for .99 cents only to discover it's not in my offline library. Then I pay 1.99 for the ""mp3"" album, and then discover it's not in my offline library."
Meadows of Heaven <SEP> Love this song and this group. Just beautiful and so relaxing wish they would tour the states again.
Great Song <SEP> I think this is one of One Directions better songs. Very catchy. Great to listen on any road trip. Yep.
"LOVED IT <SEP> I love One Direction and I wanted a song from the new album, so I listened to a bit of this song and decided to buy it. I love the part when they shout OWW. Great song. I think you will love it if you love 1D."
Five Stars <SEP> I love Gregorian.
EWW ONE DIRECTION IS SPLITTING... INTO MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS! FALSE ADVERTISING <SEP> The album cover is AWKWARD! I will not take you home too.
"Purchase by request <SEP> By request, I purchased this song for my son who loves them.  He also love the video so he ask me to buy it so he can listen to it anytime he wants with my phone."
we should not let our children listen to this junk. <SEP> I bought this for my daughters cheer group. I dislike this song and I am no fan of this group.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this!
"Susan Boyle - How Can You Beat That? <SEP> OMG she's wonderful. Her voice takes you to another time and place. Close your eyes and feel the power of music on your emotion, your soul, and your mood."
My dausghter likes it <SEP> She begged me to get it then said it was OK. Realy what is that all about lol... oh well teens I guess
"Highly energetic dancefloor songs! <SEP> Amazing, powerful new-wave songs that can take you back to the 80s and launch you into the future all at the same time. I can't pick a favorite off this EP, they're all so good. Energy through the roof, out into space.. and beyond the galaxy. This is a fantastic EP."
"Five Stars <SEP> awesome group, amazing music!"
One Star <SEP> 29 seconds is too short
Five Stars <SEP> Arrived Safe
Five Stars <SEP> Best band ever made!!  Period.
"Perfect tempo, charming vocals <SEP> La cancion tiene mucha cadencia y harmonia sabrosa.
""Vente Negra""  is probably one of the nicest arrangements I've heard  in 2015 insofar.
Perfect tempo, charming vocals, beautiful feeling, instrumentation that leads to playfulness within music during a dance.
I've read the track has made it's way through the Latino Barrios of South/ Central  America como un picante.
I now have it on active rotation in my DJ playlist for the Global Salseros of NYC dance parties .
Gracias Muchachos.! It's pleasure to introduce  new music to newer audiences in NYC. It's my mission. :)
Les Felicito  y sigan pa'lante por esas
Calles y Barrios harmoniosas.. Abrazo, Luis Felicies (DJB-NYC)"
"It was ok <SEP> I got this mediation and was definitely not in love with it. There were several minutes of blank air time towards the end of the recording. I am not sure if it was a bad recording, or was intended to be there."
Awesome album! <SEP> Saw the three-piece from San Antonio play during SXSW and bought this album at the show. They put on a great show and I've been hooked on this album since I got it!
Two Stars <SEP> Overpriced for a high school accompanist without original tunes.  I did not buy it for the vocals.
"Got the Google Doodle bump! <SEP> May 8th was Saul Bass' birthday.  For 2013, Google's delightful Doodle celebrated Saul's movie title legacy accompanied by ""Unsquare Dance""; the perfect fit!"
"Funny, Intelligent Writer <SEP> I have worn out the 4 CD's that Hayes Carll has made so far.  He really can't sing very well, but writes beautiful songs.  He also has quite a sense of humor on many of them.  I guess you could call him a Texas country singer/songwriter (with emphasis on the writing.)  I like him so much better than the new crop of ""country music"" singers."
One Star <SEP> Some of this bugged me more than centering me.
"Compilation <SEP> Live Jive is a great cross section of the late 60's early 70's band in San Francisco.  It gives you a real flovor of what the music scene was like here in SF during that time.  A real treasure chest of music.  Thanks Alot.

  Peter in SF"
Amazing! <SEP> Christina's new album is amazing.  Her words are inspiring and uplifting.  I recommend this song to everyone.  It's a must.
Love it! <SEP> Brittany Howard is a force of nature. This song is infectious. Love it!
I like Christina and I like CeeLo... <SEP> But I didn't like this.  It's the pangalactic gargleblaster of songs.  I felt like my head was going to split open from the inside.  Not one subtle thing about this song.  Probably good for the club.
Four Stars <SEP> good
Five Stars <SEP> simply beautiful and thought provoking
"Starts off good, but... <SEP> This song starts off good as the main title from the film, but halfway through it segways into a bad rendition of the ""Men in Black"" 'hip-hop' pop song"
"Would really like a good copy <SEP> The cd does not work at all. I've tried it on different systems, car, etc. Unfortunate. Would really like a good copy."
Buyer Beware! <SEP> This album is misrepresented. It's certainly not Lenny Breau and Buddy Emmons.  This is a con.  Buyer Beware.
"TARGET <SEP> You can buy this combo pack of the 7"" record and shirt at TARGET stores for only $20 ;) Just trying to be helpful people."
Five Stars <SEP> This song turned me on to thrash from old school metal Megadeth rules.  Ling live Dave.
"Love the Original song... NOT this one! <SEP> I swear this changed on me. I listened to this several times, it was the original song. Then one day I played it, and it was different. I don't know how this happend, but I don't like it."
Bit rate is substandard <SEP> The song itself is GREAT but the bit rate is an unbelievably poor...147
Not liked at all. <SEP> i wouldn't take that trip down memory lane. My polictics have not come full circle with this addition.
Great song <SEP> Another classic mcr song. Love it. My favorite song from the conventional weapons series. These guys are on a roll
"Not the best song by them <SEP> I've been a fan for many years but upon hearing this song I just didn't like it. It's not a bad song at all, it just isn't the same as it once were. I will support them though and that's why I gladly bought tis song as well as the others."
"one of the best new xmas songs <SEP> this is one of the best and new Xmas songs written recently, as Sanctus Real is becoming or already is one the top ten Christian recording groups"
Comparable to Weezer <SEP> This album is my current jam. My favorites are Henry and Green eyes ( love the guitar intro!). No doubt they'll be more mainstream.
Pass on it <SEP> Only 10 songs are worth keeping
Four Stars <SEP> nice selection of various types of Xmas music.
Music from a rising star <SEP> If you are an Emma Hewitt fan you need to get this.
"Great album and it still resonates forladies today Always enjoyed ... <SEP> Great album and it still resonates forladies today
Always enjoyed KT OSLiN'S MUSIC. classy, revelant , every song tugs on the heart, where is a woman to go when she's feeling low and all she wants to do is feel a little better."
I love the song & love the singer!  <SEP> I love her music! This lady is so full of talent and class! I wonder if she's still performing. I would love to attend a live performance.
"Pura Energia Cristiana <SEP> La musica de Acrisolada te pondra a arder en fuego. Si quieres escuchar musica con letra positiva y mucha energia, esta es tu opcion."
Five Stars <SEP> I want to f#### the weeknd's sexy ass!
beautifully <SEP> Lyics and sounds that leave you in a transe... beautifully made
Five Stars <SEP> Super nice music for my baby shower and for calm my baby
woof... <SEP> I am an obsessive fishbone fan. That being said this is a terrible recording of a bad song
Five Stars <SEP> Amazing song by two amazing vocalist.
"WHAT HAPPENED HERE? <SEP> These are NOT electronic re-imaginings of beloved compositions, but rather a chorus of high-pitched Japanese children (?) squealing over a thunderous orchestra playing what seems like the theme to a spaghetti-western.  Or maybe the von Trapps tour Manchuria circa 1933.  Truly god-awful and embarrassing."
Five Stars <SEP> Love Love Love!!!
Before its time... <SEP> Two plantation owners find out that they had a Jamaican grandmother.  The singing of Harry Belefonte was wonderful.
"i did order,.,by accident <SEP> i did order this,,by accident"
"this mix leaves me anxious <SEP> I bought this mix because it was supposedly the one on VH1, but it really bugs me because the refrain is always cut short and then mixes. It's like it never gets fully going, and you're constantly waiting on it to hit that beat. I bought the original version instead, and am much happier. Still not clean, but at least the hook is complete."
"Not a radio edit! <SEP> If you are looking for a radio edit (kid friendly version), this is not for you!  Once I can figure out how to return a digital download to Amazon, I will be getting a refund."
"Tommy Dorsey;  Not a great jazz player. <SEP> When I think about Tommy Dorsey I hear a big dance band, lots of singers and ""I'm Getting Sentimental Over You"". If you like jazz trombone from that era of  American music, listen to Jack Teagarden.  This tune and 'The Clambake Seven' are fun though."
Distorted <SEP> the download is distorted
"Not the clean version <SEP> This is not the ""radio version"" we've heard on the radio, the one that uses the line ""I'm a nineties chick."" Rather this one is the B- version, which I won't play for my young daughter. Annoying."
"Not That Flossin' <SEP> Even though it is chopped and screwed, this isn't the original song."
"Up and coming band making fun pop with a hipster edge <SEP> Very fun music.  Can't wait for a full album from this group!  They present as ""alt/hipster"" but the music is very accessible pop without being juvenile or bubble gum"
"Brilliant! <SEP> Haim, I swear, if you keep on making these delicious, catchy-as-hell, spunky, energetic, harmonious, glorious pop music chestnut gems, well then, the sky is the limit for you talented sirens!!!"
"just beautiful. Very inspirationa <SEP> Lovely rendition of The Prayer.  It is sung in two languages, in English and Hawaiian lyrics, just beautiful. Very inspirationa."
"Worth it for your Christmas gatherings <SEP> About two bazillion hours of ""Christmas background"" music for your holiday gatherings.  Set it to play and forget about it for the evening."
"Two Stars <SEP> Not so big hits. Culling the bottom of the barrel. But hey, it was $0.99"
"GOOD SONG <SEP> Enjoyed the song, just wish they had a whole album (when we bought the mp3). Nothing to complain about with a good pop tune like this."
Five Stars <SEP> This record is great! Everything by haim is amazing.
Hot sound from LA <SEP> It is quite refreshing to hear something different for a change. These girls have got a unique sound and style that is catchy. I can't wait to share it with my kids.
Saw them live <SEP> I was very impressed with the energy of this band.  I thought they were great!  I only wish they'd release a LP.
One Star <SEP> Wrong song
... songs done in the old fashioned way by an EXCELLENT songstress! <SEP> Old fashion songs done in the old fashioned way by an EXCELLENT songstress!!!!
Do not buy. Terrible Quality <SEP> Do not buy this song. I love the song but amazon did a terrible job encoding it and there are pops and crackles and the song is really faded. They claim it's a 256kbps file which is a lie it's 71kbps and is a 1.8MB file when a 256 would be around 6MB. If you go to Tobiahs official website they have the song for free. I would encourage you to support them by buying it but at their website Tobiah.se they have a 256kbps version and it sounds SOOOO much better than this horrible encoding.
"There's much better out there now <SEP> Who picked these songs?  For Dominican music, many of them have a strangely Mexican sound. And some of the songs are rather rough-- stress that doesn't fall on the right part of the word, etc. You can do much better than this these days-- try ""Bachata #1's"" for a mix of modern artists (with Monchy y Alexandra and Xtreme heavily represented) or the ""Rough Guide to Bachata"" for a wider selection of more traditional (but still recent) sound. Even ""Bachatahits 2002"" is much better than this disc. Avoid."
"Bachata para todos los gustos-buen disco de verdad <SEP> For a compilation cd, I must say it is wonderful. This is the first of this series by J & N records (the originators of the Merenhits series) and they definitely have showcased the best of the best. I was particularly impressed with the sequence of top bachatas one after the other which would make for great listening in any type of setting. The only surprise is that some of the bachatas are from '98 and for a newly launched series it may have been more attractive to have the newest and latest bachatas but other than that this cd is a winner. I highly recommend this purchase."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonder full song
"Beautiful ... <SEP> I oiginally bought this song in the album by The Ten Tenors and it is still my favorite rendition. But there are some times when you need the clear version of one voice. I listened to a few of these, and without a doubt this by Erkan Aki is my first choice for solos. Magnifico!"
Five Stars <SEP> THANKS
Fun song <SEP> I am a huge supporter of James and he is such an inspiration for anyone who has any obstacles in their way. Every thing him and his band does is pure gold.
"Not Even Worth The Effort To Download For Free <SEP> I live on the east coast ... I hear screaming all year long .... I don't need it in my Christmas music... even if you turn down the volume on your speakers ... it's still too loud ... If you want stress free holiday music with a little volume ... stick with the Brian Setzer Orchestra .... download Jingle Bells for free this week ....&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jingle-Bells/dp/B003TOP3C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jingle Bells</a>

A note to all would-be reviewers ... Amazon will not let you write a review with out at least one star, so the one that you see at the top of this review wasn't my idea."
Five Stars <SEP> Blessed Music.
bad job <SEP> not a full song....not happy
"Uncool Cat <SEP> This CD is not too good.  My cat can not even stay in the room when I put the CD on the stereo.

UNcool Cat recordings !"
"it is about a 10 second loop of wind chimes done for 1 hour and 40 minutes. <SEP> it is about a 10 second loop of wind chimes done for 1 hour and 40 minutes. if you don't notice loops then this won't be a problem. but i can hear loops that are less than a minute, and it kills the listening pleasure, i CANNOT relax to it i hear the loop. shorter than 30 seconds really drives me nuts. this should be free NOT 99 cents !!!"
Great Funky Album <SEP> Great Funky Album.
superb arrangement <SEP> The melody goes five times with different lyrics. The arrangement is superb. You will hear each repeat with different sound built-up.
I don't understand how the download works so didn't download ... <SEP> I don't understand how the download works so didn't download it. Will not download any more music until I figure out how to use your program.
"great dance music <SEP> makes me want to dance, catchy and fun."
Two Stars <SEP> No one of pitbull's best.
"It is one of the songs by a great group. <SEP> It is one of the songs by a great group...the Del-Vikings...but it sure is a flop,probably because doo-wop was their forte"
Five Stars <SEP> 5 Star CD
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!
"Filthy, disgusting, wrong <SEP> Accidentally clicked the wrong button to get it, so it's not exactly in my vein of interest anyway, but what a completely sophomoric, filthy, vulgar, miserable waste of air. Self-seeking waste of a voice."
"Disappointed <SEP> I guess I should have listened to this first before I bought it.  It's a live version of the song with a lot of talking at the beginning and Roger Daltrey is apparently older when he sang the song because it's not good, to be polite! I was disappointed because I love this song and expected it to be the original. I ended up purchasing ""Best of Rocker and Ballads"" with (hopefully) the original version on it."
"language still there in the ""clean"" version <SEP> Be aware that even the clean version very clearly says f*** and a** several times. I use this for a class and that did not go over well."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome!
"Vamos a bailar, pero no con este cd. <SEP> So, if you're looking for some Latin brass to dance to, look somewhere else.  I'd recommend the Afro-Cuban Allstars for that classic Cuban sound, or Cecelia Noel for something more modern and energetic.  This collection,  instead of being backed by a six or eight piece brass section was backed,  it seems, by some dude with a synthesizer, and maybe a guy with some bongos  (although that might have been the synthesizer too, I'm not sure.  I could  only stand listening to it once).  Tito Puente it ain't."
LOVE IT LOVE IT! <SEP> I ABSOLUTLY LOVE YFM! especially Benetar. so of course i would love this song. its nice sweet and fun. i converted my friends into MARTIANS! i showed them some of my favorites and they absolutly love them they cant get enough!
"Disappointed <SEP> This album was sold as ""In Very Good Condition"". It was not. The album was pretty crackly and scuffed on the surface and the cover was exposed to water and smelled like mold & mildew. It took a long time to get the cover dried completely and that smell will never completely come out. You can still smell traces of mildew."
"Straight ahead Rock 'n Roll.  Turn it Up !  Good Stuff ! <SEP> Brynn Arens (formerly of Flipp) is a very talented front man and writes some good riffs.  Tom Cook on drums & Casey Gooby on guitar round out what is a very fine line up of Twin Cities musicians.  Oh yes, & Kris Barratto on bass, almost forgot about him. Then again, I'm a bass player too . . . People tend to forget about us.  We are, you know, right below 2nd tambourine."
"No vocals! <SEP> They should clearly state that the album is purely instrumental, no vocals here. Since K.K. is a singer, there's no excuse for using his name for these songs if you don't hear his voice. Nothing on the product page states it at all. Stay away if you're looking for the songs complete with vocals. Shameful!"
One Star <SEP> Sorry very Bad sound.lost money.
"Tracks not labelled correctly. <SEP> Yet another MP3 CD where half the songs are mislabelled.  I don't know whether this problem is unique to jazz, or whether it's a broader problem.  Amazon, please fix this."
Four Stars <SEP> Great beats.
"Enjoyable. A pleasant discovery. <SEP> ""She"" is a very underrated artist with a wealth of work. All of his albums remind me of how Daft punk albums are, unique and very well thought out albums."
"Love this Song <SEP> This song was a quick and easy download from amazon to my computer,
great song as well.  I love this album!"
Telly is a joy to listen to <SEP> Telly Leung has a wonderful voice and his tone and delivery of each and every song are perfection. He can sing anything and make it sound effortless. A total joy to listen to. Definitely looking for more Telly! One of my favorite CDs.
"Telly Leung <SEP> I thought I was ordering a CD, but it turned out to be something online only, and I didn't know how to download it. Nothing explained that, so I arranged to be reimbursed for the charge."
"Interesting covers sung beautifully <SEP> We saw Telly perform these covers live recently at 54 Below in New York City. The reworked arrangements of these songs by Gary Adler and Mary Ann McSweeney are clever and Telly's crystal-clear, perfectly-pitched vocals make them shine. This is fun background music for your next party or just relaxing listening."
Wonderful Wonderful Song - Reminding me that Jesus is Our Peace. <SEP> I recently played this song at a family reunion honoring our passed loved one reading scripture John 14:27 and John 16:33.  The wow everyone into tears and I wasn't expecting that.
One Star <SEP> Why does Nicki Minaj copy Lil Kim and then disses Lil Kim.... Nicki Mina is weird!
"the music is cool, I like the weird songs more than the ... <SEP> Its Nicki Minaj. So, the music is cool, I like the weird songs more than the ones with the super filthy lyrics"
"Buyer beware. This CD is mis-labeled, on the ... <SEP> Buyer beware. This CD is mis-labeled, on the cover and on the CD itself. I was surprised, upon hearing it, that it was in a major key, and was an entirely different concerto. On this CD you will find Bach's concerto for harpischord, strings and continuo in E, BWV 1053. Lovely piece of music, but not the one I ordered. I got a refund and have since found the piece I want, in a collection of all of Bach's harpsichord concerti: heaven!"
One Star <SEP> Not Nicki's best effort.
Bob & Tom Don't Answer That ( Don't Buy That) <SEP> The first time I've been disappointed by the annual CD.  It's gone from 3-4 CD's down to one.  I don't know what they were thinking when they issued this trash.  Don't waste time buying this one.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
Good lyrics <SEP> One of my favorite ring tones
"Catchy!!! <SEP> So, I'm not a true die-hard Minaj fan, but when I heard this some via a performance on some 2013 awards show, I thought it was hot enough to add to my collection of music.  So, I purchased it, and I'm still jamming to it....it's a good, drive home song, a good song when you sitting around the office earning your paycheck, it's a good song when you've got to do some weekend house cleaning.  So I give it to Ms. Minaj, she was thinking something with this tune....plus the addition of Lil Wayne didn't hurt at all"
"did not download to my phone <SEP> I heard this song on independant radio in California and liked it, so I downloaded it from Amazon. However, it appears nowhere in my phone or app and I can't play it."
"SERIOUSLY?!?! <SEP> I listened to this with my dogs.  ""Bioacoustically designed classical music.""  No one cared.  It sounded like the rack that starts playing when you walk by at the department store.  I believe music can calm a dog, but this music had no effect on the elderly dog and two pups that I have.  I sing to my elderly dog during storms.  The louder the thunder, the louder I sing.  But it isn't the music.  It's the sound of my voice instead of the sound of the storm.  I'm not about to blare this ""stuff"" at any time.  Pick something else.  Sing a lullaby!"
"Older and Maybe Better <SEP> This is pretty good for the first album in 16 years.  The songs are more mature and Kristine's voice is as beautiful as ever.  There are moments when one can hear the 'rust', but it takes time to dust off the old talent and refresh it.  Overall, I really liked the reflective nature of this CD."
"Just like I remember them! <SEP> This CD will not disappoint you if you are a Sweatheats of the Rodeo fan.  It's been a long time since they released a new CD,but worth the wait."
"My Favorite Tony Bennett Tune <SEP> This song was in the first album I ever purchased.  I was seventeen and that was 55 years ago and I still have the album.  I danced to ""So Far"" with the boy of my dreams in my kitchen a zillion times and still love this song the best of all the songs in all my Tony Bennett albums.
Only wish I could get it on a new CD."
Five Stars <SEP> The voices of angels. Now I know.
Grown Folks music! <SEP> Saw the video and fell in love with the song...Anthony David has that rapsy sound that's unique but sexy. Simple lyirics but the rhythm makes you want to move and lose yourself in the moment....But it's definitely one of the songs in rotation on my mp3 for workout playlist.
This is my brothers favourite band. I had to buy this for him ... <SEP> This is my brothers favourite band. I had to buy this for him for his birthday.  Just found out he only likes iTunes.  Now I have a complete set of heavy metal music.  Lol.  Oh well.
"Two Stars <SEP> Not bad, just not enough favorites"
"Great Raw unBlack Metal! <SEP> This is the black metal disc that caused people to boycott and send nasty hate mail to Nuclear Blast. Why? Because this band supports Christian ideas. Funny how it's a crime to censor anyone except someone who holds to Christian values. Hmmm...

Anyhow, the music on this disc is so feakin' fast that it becomes ridiculous The name of the game here is everybody play as fast as you can, whoever gets to the end of the song first wins! Well, that would be true except that this one time project is by one man who plays all the instruments, who's goes by the name Anonymous. Of course most people know that Anonymous is ex-Mortification/Paramaecium drummer Jayson Sherlock. (Well, if ya didn't know, you know now.) The drum work on this disc is outstanding; it almost seems impossible for any human to play that fast. ""Hellig Usvart"" is Norwegian and means ""Holy Unblack."" And in the cover Horde has written: ""Vi de uddelige inviterer dere til  sl dere sammen med oss"". This too is Norwegian and means something like this: ""We the immortal invite you to join us.""
RECOMMENDED!!!"
"Not impressed <SEP> I saw Ed K in concert in November and it was a great show, he can still belt out the tunes.  He did a couple of songs from this album... I had a good laugh with some of the lyrics (dirty water's easier to find??), yet being a true fan I bought the album anyway.  I actually enjoyed Ed's first solo album, and was hoping to find more of the same, but instead I got 5 mediocre songs with 5 terrible remixes.  Anyone remember the Live album V where Ed tried to rap and actually said ""To the crib then back to the studio, write a song so good make a midget grow""??  Well let me tell you my friends, after going to ""The Garden"" those midgets are still short!"
"The Garden leaves you wanting more... <SEP> Loved Ed's first solo release ""Alive"" and love ""The Garden"" just as much if not even a little more! I find myself hitting replay immediately after listening to every song.  I love all the songs on this ep especially the remake of John Lennon's ""Mind Games"".  ""The Garden"" doesn't disappoint and definitely leaves you wanting more...can't wait for the new album to come out!"
"This is truly sad effort from a once great vocalist... <SEP> Let me first say that was a huge fan of +Live+ and of Ed's vocals and lyrics.  Many of his songs from from his former band moved me in ways I cannot fully explain.  There was a magic that came from +Live+ and for me, that magic has been lost with Ed's solo efforts. I really wanted this EP to be great.  I agree with many others that this effort is lazy at best and comes across as cheesy.  The soul is gone and If you ever have a chance to listen to +Live+, you will immediately understand what I mean.  In my opinion, Ed is trying to write top 40 hit songs and has traded simple lyrics for his older, more thought provoking ones.

Bottom Line:  The voice is still there but the soul is long gone."
"Great song, helps me relax after a long day ... <SEP> Great song , helps me relax after a long day of work, with a glass of wine."
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
"Nice 90s jam <SEP> For old school hip hop and R&B fans, this is a nice jam to add to your collection. Love this song."
One Star <SEP> Deja mucho que desear
"pretty cool <SEP> I can't really say much other than I really like the song, it conjures up so much nostalgia. . ."
bought it! <SEP> it's a great album worth every penny
"One Star <SEP> I like the original version tones better! But the kongos are awsome, outstanding, cool, ..."
Two Stars <SEP> Skating ring memory it's okay back then it was The Happening thing
"Very disappointing and I gave it as a gift to ... <SEP> Very disappointing and I gave it as a gift to a student learning French.  Thought it was a collection of basic French songs of the French culture.  Learned my lesson,  I won't buy another cd unless I can sample a selection of songs."
"Excellent Summer Smash way back When!! <SEP> I can remember Connie Francis and ""V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N"" and Bobby's ""Judy, Judy Don't Be Moody"" while working at Carson Park in the Northern League (Eau Claire, WI Braves).  Very upbeat and stylish by Bobby.  Hard to believe it was a  flip-side to ""Splish - Splash"".  He was a very versatile performer, singing on smash hits, club performances and filling in many times for Johnny Carson.  Give Bobby Darin a chance for younger people.  I know they won't be disappointed!"
"Is this really Lawrence Tibbett? <SEP> This hardly captures the breadth of Tibbett's voice.  Sounds as if someone else recorded these home spun songs.  Tibbett died in 1960 at the age of 63 so if the 1957 publish date is correct, these recordings were made when the baritone was approx. 59/60 years old.  By that time the ravages of time and alcohol took their combined effect.  Not worth the listen really."
"Very good C.D. <SEP> Mama Lover is a very good c.d. All the tracks are good songs. It is a lot of good dance music. Mama Luba,Mama Lover the Russian and english versions of the same song are both bouncy very dancible music. I thoughly enjoyed the c.d and I think if you give it a listen you will too."
"BEAUTIFUL <SEP> LOVE IT...AMAZING.. SIT BACK , CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LISTEN TO SOME EXCEPTIONALLY BEAUTIFUL PAN MUSIC.. YOU WOULD NOT REGRET BUYING THIS CD"
very seductive! <SEP> very seductive!
"amazing song, <SEP> and sound quality I wish Amazon would offer FLAC files instead of only mp3, otherwise this is a great track"
"Remix cd is awesome <SEP> great remixers, great variety of mixes..a must have for fans of the new album. The remix cd is a great deal for the price and dance music leaning fans will not be disappointed."
Five Stars <SEP> Nice song
"JOSHUA IS ANOINTED! <SEP> I LOVE Joshua, but this was a disappointment because I prefer the traditional (like James Cleveland's styling). He's still ONE OF THE BEST on all days, not just Sunday."
"Overboard <SEP> Joshua has some nice songs but he was trying too hard on this one, he sound Smokie Norful and it was unoriginal and little too much screaming.  Joshua bring it back home and be original and sing from the heart."
"Oh My God! <SEP> This record has everything that you'd expect from Kali: incredible lyrics, emceeing, and singing coupled with the most eclectic mix of styles in the game. Knock Your Wig has an incredible west-coast feel, sampeling Ohio Players' ""Funky Worm"" and using copious ammounts of talkbox that indeared this record to me within seconds of turning it on. Will Not disapoint"
"Fun, but short <SEP> I enjoyed this EP by Kali.  I really enjoyed his last full LP, so it is always good to hear something from this musician."
One Star <SEP> its only a one minute song
"Five Stars <SEP> Mark Moore performs the Bruce Broughton Concerto for Tuba, First Movement."
"This is really annoying, at least to me <SEP> How bigheaded has a singer to be, if he in every single song several times sings his own name! This is really annoying, at least to me. I was not aware of this, when I bought this album. Maybe I'm over-sensitive, but if I want to hear or see advertisements I go for TV or radio, but not for music I bought with my money. Without doubt Prince is a very good singer, but I probably will not buy any further album or song from him, because of his permanent name-checking. There is lots of good music without such self-advertisements.

Sorry Prince, you should reconsider this habit."
"DO NOT BUY! <SEP> DO NOT BUY! looking for bass notes, not stupid placement advice"
"THE TAN CANARY (JOHNNY ADAMS) SINGS! <SEP> REGARDING JOHNNY ADAMS: IN NEW ORLEANS HE WAS KNOWN AS THE TAN CANARY BECAUSE HIS VOICE WAS SO GOOD. WHAT A RANGE HIS VOICE HAS. I KNOW MANY SINGERS WHO MOURNED HIS PASSING A FEW YEARS AGO. ALL HIS CDS ARE GREAT, ESPECIALLY ""THE VIRDICT"" AND ""MAN OF MY WORD"". GET HIS MUSIC IF YOU LIKE BEAUTIFUL BLUES AND R@B MUSIC."
"Don't bother <SEP> These are all resings.  Synthesizer tracks, and are not the originals.  Don't waste your money."
Did not like it. <SEP> I did not like it at all.  Out it in my give-away bag.
"Sounds AWFUL!!!  Download made from an old vinyl LP. <SEP> Don't buy this downloaded song or the album. BAD! Copied from a noisy vinyl LP. Don't waste your $$$.  Get a ""hard copy CD""  instead."
Great Fun! <SEP> 2 bucks gets you an awesome Medley of 40 Christmas songs by the Awesome Brett Domino Trio... why are you even still reading this review? It's awesome... ok there I said it. Now go buy it!
"Five Stars <SEP> Great artist, great music."
"Five Stars <SEP> LOVE IT, LOVE IT !!!!!!"
Awful <SEP> This is probably the WORST rendition of this song I've ever heard!!!!  Painful to listen to!!!
"Great to hear <SEP> I went to college with Steve & saw him many times at the Ash Grove in L.A. in the 60s. He is a remarkable musician. Many of the tracks on this CD are from out-of-print vinyl issued in the 60s. Steve disappeared from the scene for a long time & those who knew him wondered what happened to him. Thankfully, he is alive & living in the Bay Area. Many people have recorded his instrumental ""Holly,"" which is inclded on this disk. If you are interested in phenomenal fingerpicking blues on both 6- and 12-string guitar do not pass up the opportunity to get this release. He backed up Sonny & Cher on some of their hit singles & played guitar on Dr. John's first album. Hot Tuna featured an instrumental called ""Mann's Fate"" which was a tribute to Steve. He was an underground legend as a blues guitarist. Now that this CD has surfaced, see why. A bonus is 3 tracks with Steve backing up Janis Joplin in a Bay Area hotel room."
you must buy this album. <SEP> this was a pretty pricey cd but i love taylor swift and the red album so much so it was totally worth it. this album is a masterpiece and it deserved the grammy of the year award (possibly more so than 1989).
One Star <SEP> Didnt care for all the different renditions
"One Star <SEP> I LIKED THIS ALBUM MUCH MORE THAN HER LATER ALBUM ""1989"", WHICH WAS VERY GOOD."
Love it <SEP> This one by Future is better than the clean version but I do like to play them both get this song
"Best Mashup Since Adele's Rumor Has It/Someone Like You <SEP> These 2 songs fit together perfectly. I love how they slowed down Home. Gives it that ballad feel. Love the voices of Dianna, Amber and Naya."
"This was Glee??! <SEP> Crazy, kinky and absolutely compelling! I love the original by Scissor Sisters and (with the exception of the cleansing of one line of lyric) is identical to the original. When I listen to this, I can completely picture in my mind the superb staging of this in the show.  The ""avant guard"" music style is unlike anything else the Glee cast has done. I hope that they will try another in the future."
Great song <SEP> I heard her sing this song on gma  and had to have it. Great music from Alicia keys go girl
".99 for 17 seconds hardly a good buy <SEP> I wanted the full song not just 17 seconds!!  I should have paid ore attention to the reviews first.
17 seconds for .99.  I guess they have to make enough to pay Bezos somewhere."
"Amazon sucks. <SEP> Screwed.  First time by Amazon after spending thousands of dollars with them.  Using this for a certain video, only got 17 seconds of the song. I download songs for my videos all the time from Amazon.  Amazon sucks."
One Star <SEP> sucks it is a sample song and it doesn't tell you that! like many cash back!
One Star <SEP> Wanted the whole song!
motivational <SEP> This is the anthem for positive self esteem and very motivating with a good feel.
"Awesome <SEP> Just a great CD from start to finish, trying to to wear it out.  Need to find more music by him"
"Great Music. <SEP> I enjoy listening to all of the songs in this album.  I listen to it when I run and it gives me motivation.  It kind of takes you all over the place as far as genre, and I like that."
Not the original 80's classic <SEP> Thought this was the 80s classic.
One Star <SEP> That's one too.
"Not Even Close To A Playground. <SEP> This CD was not at all like I expected. With a name like 'The Playground' I was expecting something more upbeat and cheerful. Instead, I got something dark and extremely vulgar. Parents, do not be fooled, this is not good playground music."
I love ALL of BBs songs <SEP> BB King most famous oldy.  I love ALL of BBs songs.  This is my fave!
"Just Awesome..... <SEP> Live music at its best....Jaco does not disappoint!!!!  A ""must have"" in any collection....."
"bought this on a recommendation of a friend... <SEP> I purchased this song on the recommendation of a friend. I did not care for the song, although I listened to it on several different occasions.. if you like alternative rap, then you might like it...music is a very personal art and I am a strong believer of ....to each it's own."
"An undiscovered (by me) Eldridge performance <SEP> ""Phil's Tune"" was apparently recorded while Roy lived in Paris. It's one more nice performance to add to his many others. I hadn't been aware of its existence, and i have a pretty complete Roy collection. At this late date, I'm still being surprised by the audio and video gems that people have been hoarding for 40 years, but now release for the pleasure of us all."
"Pure Dance Blast! <SEP> If you love the original version for the pure energy rush you feel when you hear it, you find that the remixes are a LOT of fun, and you will not want to stop dancing until you reach exhaustion! Thse are great for work out, too!"
Nice song <SEP> Found this song looking for something else but it's actually pretty good.
"can I exchange it for a better version? When the songs are previewed we can ... <SEP> This version ends abruptly, can I exchange it for a better version?  When the songs are previewed we can hear the whole song.  How will I know if another version is any better.  What can you expect for a buck."
One Star <SEP> Not the Pointer Sisters! Don't buy this!!!
need winzip to open file. I don't have it waste of money <SEP> need winzip to open file. I don't have it waste of money
Do not down load this! <SEP> Didn't download the entire song.  Cuts off at the end.
"Flower Flesh - 'Duck In The Box' (Black Widow) <SEP> Looks to be the modern-day progressive band's only CD (so far). Flower Flesh comes from Bardino Nuovo, Italy. 'Duck In The Box' was notably inspired by '70's classic rock - although I believe that a number of hard rock fans should definitely get something good from it. Tunes that I liked the most were the nine-minute ""My Gladness After The Sadness"", ""It Will Be The End"" [great keyboards], ""Antarctica"" and the well-played ""Scream And Die"". Line-up: Daniel Elvstrom - lead vocals, Marco Olivieri - guitar, Ivan Giribone - bass, Andrea Sgarlato - synthesizer and Andrea Fazio - drums. Might appeal to fans of Spock's Beard, Dream Theater and possibly Lustmord. Overall, just good progressive / psych."
Pianissimo Brothers <SEP> I bought this song and several others by these artist. A good piano rendition of many songs that I have liked in the past.
"But I happened to catch VH1 soul channel showing the video and I fell in love with this song <SEP> I don't remember hearing this song when I was coming up.  I always heard the song ""Alone"".  I didn't know that this group had other hits. But I happened to catch VH1 soul channel showing the video and I fell in love with this song.  Today's man need to go back to living by this song."
I thought that it would be different. <SEP> I guess I should of listened to it first. I thought it sounded sort of like James Brown. Just not what I wanted to hear.
this is classic <SEP> This album is a blessing. It brings back so many memories of when I was a child listening to this. You will certainly be blessed by the Lord as He uses the Gems along with Teddy Huffam.
Amazing cd! <SEP> Got to me earlier then expected! Amazing cd!
"""Discotheque"" Album, 1964 <SEP> This Discotheque album (LP vinyl), under the label of Coronet Records, has many remarkable and likable hits. The song that I like best is ""Just One Look""; it was sung originally by Doris Troy (1963), then by The Hollies, and Bee Gees (1964). All its hits were recorded by unknown artist/band. The record got the songs from big time twisters Chubby Chucker; Dee Dee Sharp, The Marvelettes. A most sought after music item. By Edgardo Valentino D. Olaes"
"Thanks for the Memories <SEP> Pedro Aznar, celebrates the work, music and poetry of Luis Alberto Spinetta faithfully respecting the song's essence and also adding his personal talent and good taste. Rock, Jazz, beatiful melodies and arrengements. This Album is a must for every fan of Argentine Music and a good entry point for those who are not."
"Awesome Album, Awesome Band! <SEP> Awesome album!  I have been a bluegrass fan for years and the songs and vocals of this band are absolutely amazing. It is very refreshing to hear a young group perform so so well!"
Five Stars <SEP> He was very talented and I love listening to this CD especially Lonely Boy
jah rastafari <SEP> Heard it over and over. Loved it.i recommend it to everyone who loves reggae and also to the ones who never heard it before.
"Five Stars <SEP> My favorite, he just awesome! Love it a lot, and the wrap really good, thanks!"
"not the actual soundtrack <SEP> union of sound...i didn't really know what they were.  but they aren't the original artists.  there is no mp3 album for the wedding singer movie soundtrack, only cds.  what is the point of wanting to walk down memory lane if it isn't even the original???"
Fantastic entertainer <SEP> I saw Dery and his group on a cruise this year.  He puts on a great performance.  Dery has a very diverse singing talent with a good range.  His music is fun and great to listen to.  I have 2 of his cds and enjoy them both.
bought new from stones. limited use. book has ... <SEP> bought new from stones. limited use. book has fallen apart...completely. pic of kieth and mick rubs against case so comes off and peels away from glue. and. not enough music. am i the only one?...then ignore
"CDs or CD-Rs? <SEP> CDs or CD-Rs were just thrown in LP cover with no special CD holder.  And why two discs......I was able to put the entire concert on one cd for use in my car at 79 minutes and 36 seconds.
It's my understanding that this set was recorded from two shows. That would explain why some of the songs like ""Angie"" for instance, are not the same performances as the ones that were put out on bootleg recordings taken from the King Biscuit Flower Hour. So if you get this you may still want to hold on to those bootlegs."
"... when you are not flush with cash and your favorite band from your favorite time period put out this ... <SEP> What to do when you are not flush with cash and your favorite band from your favorite time period put out this extravagant box set?
Wait until you see one you can afford and do not hesitate. BUY IT! Without a doubt this is the best box set I have ever seen. From the presentation box to the heavyweight vinyl to the poster and the incredible book. OMG! The book. Tons of photos I have never seen before and the middle section in heavyweight glossy pages. This is a gorgeous coffee table sized hardcover book in a ridiculous slipcover with a giant 3-D tongue.
This is the only time period of the Stones I would drop this amount of cash on and this is one of the best shows of the 1972-1973 tour. Nick Kent says so in the book. He was at a lot of the shows. I'll take his word for it.
This is the first time this was officially released and it blows the bootlegs away. Period.
Man, even the mailer made sure the box would arrive safe and sound and dent free.
Rolling Stones Archives gets an A+ from me."
"Jump is my favorite workout song <SEP> I love the fact that she redid ""pony"" for girls and the music is awesome the way it builds and climaxes.  It gets me pumped more than any other song on in my phone"
"Heard a DJ play it <SEP> It uses the Genuwine hook and lyrics from their Pony song, has some dub step flare to it. All in all, worth the $1.29 for the song."
Sexy song <SEP> Its like a revamped version of Ginuwine's Pony.  I like the song a lot and I like the new Rihanna.  I might think about buying the whole album.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song
Bad B#$! <SEP> Gansta
"Review  of Lost In Paradise by Rihanna <SEP> After her last album, I though the next one would not be as strong.  But, she keeps coming up with new hits.  She is one of the best new singer/performer at this time."
"Not a very good album <SEP> I like Rihanna, her style and music, but this time her album was very disappointed to me, hope she would release a good album soon"
"Cold and Touchless <SEP> When it has came down to Rihanna, there is one thing she does not have, a real voice. She has honestly shown to be one of the worst female singers of the past decade. Her latest song from Unapologetic Numb is absolutely terrible. She really drags the song down in her style. Also when she collaborated with Eminem on the song, it felt like the connection died and buried with the casket into the grave. The song is absolutely awful, and lacking heart. Rihanna has honestly made some bad choices in her songs. She definitely needs to take a long break and find herself all over again. Maybe then, she can come back and have a real voice, or just stop singing altogether.

Song: D-"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Perfect! <SEP> Perfect!
Nice beat! <SEP> I heard this song in a store and came home and bought it for my MP3 player.  Nice beat and reminds us that sometimes things are nobody's business.
Five Stars <SEP> Ok
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song.
One Star <SEP> Ok
"amazing song <SEP> i liked the song alot it is my favorite song ever
I really reccoment this song if you like rihanna and if you love rihanna you need to get it now"
Disappointed <SEP> It's not that great only has a couple of good songs. Her last 3 albums were way better than this one.
"The album is fantastic from start to finish - they've absolutely nailed it <SEP> I'm always on the lookout for new original Christmas tunes.  I had never heard of the Rosebuds until I stumbled across this album.  The album is fantastic from start to finish - they've absolutely nailed it!  If you like the Lumineers, The Head and The Heart, My Morning Jacket, Jars of Clay or Bright Eyes - you will probably like this album."
cant remember <SEP> i honestly just wathed this four a very brife part of the symphony
"love song-;- <SEP> To be honest, I do not like the song or the music -it make s no sense , to me nor does it have any depth---- Love Lock"
"I prefer the original Muppet version, but... <SEP> I love the original song by the Muppets, but it wasn't available for download yet (is now!!!!), and this was the only other version I could find. It's a decent cover, but it's harsh. It's hard-rocked-up. Well done, but it wasn't Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem!"
I like ordering music but once I ordered this song I ... <SEP> I like ordering music but once I ordered this song I could not find it on my phone anywhere
"Five Stars <SEP> Skillet has very great, and cool songs. GO SKILLET!"
Five Stars <SEP> Got this for my mother. She loves this album
thank you <SEP> This was a gift for a dear friend. She cried the entire cd and dvd. thank you for quick shipping and a perfect product.
"Don't do it. <SEP> Another awful ""sampler""- these are seriously not worth it. There are too many well done holiday compilations"
Heartaches & No Memories <SEP> Music again. Nice but not history of Xmas like we wanted.
Four Stars <SEP> nice
"Five Stars <SEP> Love House music, Great mix, Thanks again"
I have always loved this band <SEP> I have always loved this band.  I always dance to this song when it comes on.  Had to have it for myself. :)
Same songs as several other albums...a money waster <SEP> The same songs are on every one of these inexpensive albums.  Buy one and then stop or you will have a lot of repeats to delete.
Where is the rest of it? <SEP> How much can you say about a three minute piece?  Not worth getting if that is all there is.  How about a selection?
"For the Kids <SEP> Jingle Bells by The International Childrens' Choir, from the album ""Must-Have Christmas Masterpieces"" is a great song for children: peppy, upbeat, quick, etc. It's a nice version, just not my personal favorite."
"Ripoff Alert!  Listed as a FREE DOWNLOAD, but charged at $0.99 -- Bait and Switch! <SEP> On Christmas Day, I searched for FREE CHRISTMAS MUSIC on my Kindle HD, and this track was displayed with others, showing a FREE price.

After I clicked on this to ""GET"" it, suddenly the price changed to $0.99 !

This is unacceptable -- basic BAIT and SWITCH!

Amazon, fix this!"
Great <SEP> Put me a smile on my face and love the harmony of the children singing and creating one voice. Thanks for reading.
"could not copy to cd <SEP> Song downloaded okay but could not copy to cd. I was going to use this song in a fundraiser for American Cancer Society. I thought I had done something wrong so i downloaded it again. But still the song would not burn to a cd. I had someone at work download the song and she had the same problem. So, I puchased the song twice and co worker purchased once and still was not able to use the song. The co-worker took her computer to a technician and he could not get the song to copy, either. The technician said he had never seen that happen."
Doesn't open on iTunes <SEP> Opens and plays on windows media player but not on iTunes ..tells you to download something to play it :p
Four Stars <SEP> Love the oldschool horns
"I will be with you review <SEP> I will be with you is a song that has helped me through Life's storms since I was a child. I recommend it to anyone who needs a reminder that God will be there , most especially because of our new found status as sons of God through the death of Jesus for us."
"Piano version of great classic songs. <SEP> Everything you like to listen to with piano. Excellent! Soft, and easy on the nerves."
Two Stars <SEP> Not as powerful as I would have liked.  Dolly has done better.
Five Stars <SEP> Great sounding choir
"Incredible <SEP> A spiritual blessing daily. I listen to this song every morning to get me started on my day, and I would recommend it for every believer."
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite back in the day songs.
"Eh... <SEP> I realize music is subjective so I'll do my best to review my experience that will hopefully decide if you want to give this track a try or not.

Listening to the amazon preview, this track sounded amazing. Something throbbing and distinctly electronic that I could groove to while setting the track on repeat. What you hear in the preview is what you hear from 0:00 to 1:07. I love it, and it's something I could see using in a DJ set. But then something weird happens. The music stops, then you have your stereotypical trancey string elements sweeping in, quickly followed by some piano like sounds. It feels awkward compared to the beginning of the track but okay, I'll follow along and see what happens. Then the beat kicks in. Overall, from 1:08 to 3:30, it sounds like a completely different song with no relevance to the first or last minute. To make matters worse, from 3:54-4:48, that same awesome introduction comes back but, to get there, the poor transition going from 3:26-3:54 really highlights the fact that the middle of the song and the ends do not belong together in the same track. There is even a half beat missing here and there where the transition just suddenly stops at the 3:53 mark; there is this sound that kicks in but suddenly gets cut off while a different sound comes in. This is all in addition to the beginning of the track kicking in at full speed--it sounds like someone chopped this track from the middle of some epic mix and didn't fully include the beginning.

All in all, this track showed promise. That bit that you hear in the preview is SO good, but the overall mastering and composition of this song is terrible and the overall track feels unfinished."
"beautifully tasteful done <SEP> My wife and I danced to this when we started datign , beautifully tasteful done"
great <SEP> I knew I liked the song just needed to load it on to my MP3 player and not wait to hear it on the radio.
"Ama-Bakawa-P***y-P***y <SEP> My review title is a no doubt barely adequate attempt to transcribe John's ""speaking in tongues"" signing on the chorus of this song. To me, this song is a distant cousin of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" in that it evokes a memory from childhood of discovering something both magical and profoundly emotional. They symphony playing along with John sounds way more soulful than anything ELO ever managed. ""#9 Dream"" is one of those moments where John's artsy side yields something absolutely lovely, as opposed to, say, his artsy side yielding something like ""Two Virgins"". Maybe ""ama bakawa pussy pussy"" was John having a prophetic vision of Pussy Riot and cheering them on?"
great song <SEP> I ordered this for my husband. I had never heard this song before. It is a great song if you enjoy the older R&B.
"Children's song <SEP> I was looking for music about hot air balloons for a video, the sample made me think this was going to be a fanciful peppy ditty, but turned out to be a predictable children's song.  From a childcare perspective, it may help with memorization and rhythm."
LIES! <SEP> This version is NOT CLEAN! Buyer beware!
"This says ""clean"" so I assumed it actually was clean ... <SEP> This says ""clean"" so I assumed it actually was clean.  Nope, it has the ""n"" word in it multiple times, so if you want a ""clean"" version do not buy this."
One Star <SEP> Have not been able to download file!
Two Stars <SEP> not good
loved it. <SEP> I enjoyed this book a lot.  It didn't have those chapter of the main characters fighting in themselves about what they needed to do.  Well written.  Loved it.
Not Afraid <SEP> Love this! I programmed the alarm on my phone to wake me up to this song every morning. Great job!
"He is an excellent teacher and strongly grounded in the Word of God <SEP> If you have never heard Donnie minister, you must hear this message. He is an excellent teacher and strongly grounded in the Word of God."
"Rehash <SEP> I've been a Fresh Aire fan for years.  I decided to buy 3 CDs to see if they've come up with anything new.  The 3 were ""Massage,"" ""The Music of Spheres"" and ""Motivator.""  All 3 were complete rehash of old releases, nothing new.  If you already have Fresh Aire music don't waist your money on any of these.  If you don't have Fresh Aire music music I strongly recommend that you get some; it is the most beautiful music you'll ever hear.  However, buy the orignal releases, not these conglomerated rehashes."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent.
"Five Stars <SEP> It was funny for the first 20 times, but my 5 year still loves it"
One Star <SEP> this song stinks
Don't waste hard drive space <SEP> Mr. Methane has this musical genera cornered don't waste you time with fake emulated farts it might be free but waste your cloud storage on something else.
"""I love it"" might be stretching it a bit, but it was worth getting. <SEP> Good for a LOT of laughs - fart humor is big in my household. My kids HAD to have this. For a while after we got this, they were challenging each other to fart songs. Of course, belching is much easier. (Thankfully.)"
"Farts can be funny <SEP> I love a good fart joke, fart song, etc, but even though this was free, I still feel ripped offAdd some catchy lyrics, it is not that hard..jingle farts, jingle farts, farting all the way, ooh what fun, it is to fart, in one horse  the lyrics to the song practically writes itself

I gave it two stars because it could get a smile out of someone if you played it for them, but other than that, it wasn't that funny.."
One Star <SEP> This isn't that great.
One Star <SEP> Childish and not melodic to boot.
Five Stars <SEP> Superb !!
Oh <SEP> I'm a big fan of Cady's but this one just doesn't do it for me.
"Don't do it. <SEP> Doesn't compare with the National Orchestra of Wales version.  Don't know who this feller is, but this is a ripoff.  Wish I could get my money back for the download."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!!!
"Amazing. Transcendent. Life Changing.  <SEP> Without getting too hyperbolic, YUI's music is literally some of the best I have ever heard. I challenge ANYONE who says they like music, to listen to Again, or Rolling Star, and not be moved. YUI's music is in Japanese, but her soul speaks human-to-human. While you will get more out of it if you understand the lyrics, it isn't necessary to enjoy her music. YUI's music is for everyone on Earth, not just J-Pop/Rock fans. I love her! Next time she is in concert, literally anywhere in the world, I'm there.

"
Another banger <SEP> I miss the sounds of Floetry however this is another great hit from Marsha and she hit this one out of the park
One Star <SEP> Not as good as the original.
One Star <SEP> Anyone who thinks this is a Christian band is sadly mistaken.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"Bob Dylans voice sounds awful. <SEP> Wow, every song I previewed was terrible. There was a time where Bob Dylan had a good 'raspy'  sound. That time has long since past."
she will be the next sarah vaughn/ella <SEP> enjoyed this first recording that I have purchased-plan to purchase more in the near future.  she was on tv recently and this is when I purchased one of her songs which I really enjoyed
Two Stars <SEP> not the original version. not what I wanted
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome! The flute arrangements are beautiful.
It sucks. <SEP> The lady who sings this should have her vocal chords ripped out and destroyed. A horrible version that not see the light of day.
so happy to find this album as i have ha difficult time finding this artist <SEP> he has such a clear sound and can count on that sound no matter what he is playing. his music was hard to find ut there and and happy to pass this info on to others that I know will be happy too.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
Ditto <SEP> What I wrote about my relaxing playlist is true for this song as well. Kenny chesney's beachy soothing no cares vibe hits the spot.
Excellent song <SEP> Paul Colman writes excellent songs and mixes in great vocals and appropriate tunes.  I thoroughly enjoy all their music and will continued to get all their music.
This is the origional version <SEP> I recently heard the version form the Unraveling that sounded with more intensity ... yet this song is great the lyrics and the intentions behind it make you wonder more about the band ....great song with a depressing atmosphere.
"Lujon <SEP> This particular arrangement is Mancini in his purest form. It's a new sound and yet you instantly know that you are listening to something by Henry Mancini. It's soft and yet vibrant and alive with an upbeat tempo.
I recommend this easy listening piece for both new and seasoned Mancini fans."
"Bleargh! <SEP> Not You is a head-cracking blast of crusty punk with a thrash metal edge from four cats whose pedigrees conjure up just that: Pete The Roadie (look him up on your favorite search engine seriously) provides the oh-so-English vocal attack and a trio of Bay Area noisemongers who have served time in bands such as Neurosis, Filth, and Dystopia provide the chaos. The predominant sound here is rooted in Subhumans, G.B.H., Stiff Little Fingers, and other UK punk legends, with overtones of brutal thrash, tightly wound Dis-core, and straight-up Bay Area noise."
Overblown <SEP> Ugh.  I bought I listened I deleted it- overwrought production not at all what I expected.  Hated it hated it-you may like but not for me
"Fine song by a fine band <SEP> Its catchy, jangly, and very sad (about a young womans death), while also very beautiful. Not as much Byrds (or folk-rock) influence here as in Whats She Done to Your Mind, from the same album. Psychedelic to some extent, but maybe not as much as I Look Around. The layered instrumentation does much more than give the song some density, because the guitars and bass are worth listening to for their singular achievements, as well as for their interactions. They seem to indulge themselves, as well as answer one another, much the way the trumpet, trombone, and clarinet do in the best of Dixieland jazz. ""Blue"" is simply one good song."
"the ""sample song"" didn't show me what I needed to know. <SEP> I was so excited to have this in my library,  I heard it in the radio and got the artist off the station playlist. THIS IS NOT WHAT I HEARD ON THE RADIO! I don't know where the mistake was, but I'm deleting this version,  I dislike it that much."
Like each one <SEP> Thank you for music. Like each one.
Five Stars <SEP> great song
"CCR <SEP> What else can you say (if you're an old ""hippie"" from the 60's and 70's era)? One of best and most talented bands ever. Good old Southern Classic Rock-n-Roll!! -- Keep On Chooglin is one of the top 10 best hits of CCR in my opinion."
"Had to Be You Review <SEP> I had recently heard another song by Dara Maclean and fell in love with it, which led to me searching for more of her work. I soon found this song and fell in love with it as well. Her voice is amazing, many different ranges, the lyrics are simple, and it's a good song for whatever you need it to be, whether dedicated to your significant other or to the Lord in worship."
Five Stars <SEP> Music is soft with nice bass in drums
not the original soundtrack <SEP> this was not the original soundtrack. These songs were sung by different people and I wish I could get my money back.
Two Stars <SEP> The quality of the sound wasn't ad good. It sounds empty!
One of the original rap songs still played today. ... <SEP> One of the original rap songs still played  today. Made a second come back on the Fish Prince of Bel Air when Will and Carlton ended a talent Contest dancing to it's music.
"Sharpest lives <SEP> Really good song.
It will be hard to get tired of.
I have had a lot of friends say its a great song."
One Star <SEP> Not the version I was looking for.
One of their best songs in my opinion <SEP> One of their best songs in my opinion. I am kind of biased because I graduated from a school near Virginia Beach. ;]
One Star <SEP> Song is very low comparing to other songs.
"This stinks <SEP> Not the original version. This sounds like he recorded this while he was either very tired, or very drunk. Wasted my money on this."
One Star <SEP> Don't like it
Five Stars <SEP> Great.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
"A different take on an old favorite <SEP> I have always enjoyed listening to Royal Wade Kimes. His voice is deep and soothing. While I prefer his original songs, I have to say his country take on this song, is spectacular. This is not the original version. It is as good. His style doesn't veer too far from the original but he adds what is unique to him and his voice. It works. It works very well. If you like good old country music, this is for you. If you have always loved this song, give Royal Wade Kimes a chance to make you fall in love with it all over again."
"sultry and powerful... <SEP> this particular song makes you charged up contemplate life.. it is sultry and powerful.. if you like this one try ""the big secret"" by Michael Tomlinson .. to me all of his music is excellent listening music."
Good song <SEP> Ca$h out is one of the best rapper there is out there that why I love this song by him.
"Sound quality is horrible <SEP> Souns quality is bad, no stars"
"Second phrase played wrong <SEP> The short preview clip doesn't make it apparent but the 2nd phrase (praise Him all creatures here below) isn't played as is normal; it's missing 2 notes, as if the words ""praise Him"" are missing. How disappointing!  I'm all for creative license but some things shouldn't be messed with."
Four Stars <SEP> Nice.
One Star <SEP> Nice.
Five Stars <SEP> Love boosie and webbie they real n@#%$$
"The song is fine, if i had it on the <SEP> won't go to my MP3 player, spent too much time trying. Didn't go to my music folder, either.
Needed for a funeral, now i'm ass out and pissed off. Paid for nothing. The song is fine, if i had it
on the MP3"
"Jim Reeves and Four Walls <SEP> I have this song on numerous tapes, CD's, phonograph records, so naturally it would be one of the first I put on my new Kindlefire.  This is my husband's favorite Jim Reeves song."
"Awesome track <SEP> I really love Alicia Keys, she is one of my favorite artist.. I especially enjoyed this track. It played really smooth as all the tracks I download from Amazon."
Five Stars <SEP> Good beat and lyrics. All around good song.
"Five Stars <SEP> great song for kids, blessed!!!"
"Did not say this was a LIVE version <SEP> This song looked like it was off the original album, or so I thought.  After downloading it and listening to it with a young girl I was babysitting, I was motified to hear tons of cursing and this was a horrible live version that sounded absolutely NOTHING like the original. This was the first time I wanted to ""return"" an mp3 purchase. Not cool."
"meh <SEP> I really like this group,  however this single just doesn't really do it for me. Tho, since I am a fan, I don't regret purchasing it."
Unrecognizable <SEP> I did not realize that it was a music box version when I purchased it. The entire song is made from a small number of tones and is barely recognizable.
Five Stars <SEP> A Totally beautiful song.
great song <SEP> this is a great song and i like it very much
Scott Rocks! <SEP> Not too many people know that SR is a talented musician (unless you have Call Of Duty: Black Ops II).  Scott Rock did a fine job putting these tunes together
"poorly recorded, old recordings, you won't enjoy. <SEP> poorly recorded, old recordings, you won't enjoy."
"Hook after hook after hook <SEP> This song grabs you from the beginning and hold you on the edge of your seat to the end.

If you are at all a fan of pop bass work put on some good headphones and listen carefully.

Minus one star for overall mix quality.  Sounds like 70s radio.  But the composition and performance are outstanding.

BTW - Not knowing a word of Portuguese, I do not know what the song is about.

There are several excellent tracks on this album covering quite a variety of styles."
Outstanding CD.  Music is life changing <SEP> Outstanding CD  the music is well written and a nice change to the traditional Christmas music as usual.  I highly recommend this CD
"not studio recording <SEP> I'm a weirdo and don't like to listen to live performances, unless of course I am their with them. I should have previewd before buying."
Sometimes you can never go back. <SEP> These are rather uninspired versions of the original recordings. The vocals lack the same spirit and the instruments are just a bit off.  It would have better for Dokken to just let the past die.  The whole album sounds as though someone was forcing them to return to the studio and regurgitate what was supposed to be faded glory.
"Five Stars <SEP> I love this song from ""back in the day""! Thank you Amazon for making it available again."
Not a good version. <SEP> Not the version i thought it was. Not a good version.
"Classic <SEP> I got this for a compilation CD of all the versions of ""Lilly of the Valley"" and I enjoyed this one."
"Love it <SEP> I love this song, just added it to my ipod.  This is one of those songs you want to listen to in your car"
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
Love this song!!! <SEP> I've always been a Dawkins & Dawkins fan I still have their first album.. glad to hv them back & this song right here stay on repeat!!
"Not The YouTube Classic Video Song Version! <SEP> I was disappointed in this version because it does not have the same earnest delivery as the version that appears in the 1969 video on YouTube. This is a great song, just not as good as the original which hopefully you can get on ANOTHER compilation or try ListenToYouTube.com to see if you can tell the difference. I definitely could, and it is a shame for this too-often-neglected, excellent Scottish band. My advice: listen to the sample before you buy, which I forgot to do in this case!"
Beautiful music on cd! <SEP> Lovely cd full of well-known Christmas and non-Christmas melodies. Came on time in mail as well. Very happy with this Christmas CD.
Ahhhh - REAL Hip Hop! <SEP> This song reminds me of a time when there was REAL hip hop produced.  One of my favorites from KRS-One and just a great overall song.  HIGHLY recommend for someone looking to explore KRS-One's less popular classic songs.
i like <SEP> i really enjoy this song and many others by this singer and i just recently discover him and i really like his music.
I give it a 5!!! <SEP> It feeds my SPIRIT! ! ALSO love to do my run with a lil up beat latin music to help me keep my pace going. .
"Yep. <SEP> All the tracks are on point, like red shells."
YES HONEY!! <SEP> So love this group!! Have been a big fan of theirs since I was a little girl.....best gospel group of all times if you ask me!!
"For Fans of Enigma <SEP> Like many people who stumble onto this album, I thought it was by ""MUSE"", not ""muse"". If you want ""MUSE"" music, click on by. Having said that, I do like this album. The closest thing I can compare it to, that most people would recognize, is Enigma; which makes sense since I believe this is a French band. On top of that, for me, it has a very similar vibe as the Cross of Changes. As the saying goes, ""imitation is the highest form of flattery"". If you are willing to take a bit of a chance, give this a try!"
"These are not the Muse you are looking for. <SEP> I should have listened to the free samples, so this is bad, but this is NOT MUSE, the British band. Its some folksy late 90s slightly techno elevator music. It might be your cup of tea but please take a listen to the samples first before purchasing."
The Raver <SEP> So the Raver release by Ayah Mara is really loaded with great remixes.  The Mutated Forms Remix is easily the best one.  It has a surging baseline that keeps the tune held tight together.  Grab this remix!
"This album is just cool. There's just so much creative energy behind the ... <SEP> This album is just cool.  There's just so much creative energy behind the sound.  And it's defiant.  Many of the songs are on the garage/metal side of surf-revival with noise and experimental jazz stirred in for added flavor.  The thing I love about this album, though, is the artistry. For example:

* ""It's For You"" is very surfy, with lightning fast drum fills. Then it falls open into a few measures of pure quirk, before tightening back into a pounding rhythm and then snapping shut with a hard stop. ""Outsider in All"" is super fast, high-energy, pounding punk-surf from beginning to end.
* ""Easy"" is my favorite. Expressive drum fills and stops dice up the tempo beneath a slow melody. It seems almost measured and methodical, but if you listen, the drums really never do the same thing twice.  Instead, they are kind of singing lyrics of their own, taking turns with the vocalist in the pauses.
* ""Comfort Rules"" is complex and jazzy, and has really interesting guitar, especially when you consider there's only one guitarist and no overdubbing. The drums are symbol crashes, then experimental, and then a muddy wash until the end when a final riff tightens the whole song into a close.

The album is rebellious and quirky, but skillful and intentional. The sounds are old, the music is evolved. The energy is high!  I hope Plutonium Farmers releases another album soon.

You might like Plutonium Farmers if you like Man or Astro-man or Mermen."
"NOT FLORENCE <SEP> This was the mix I was looking for, the sample on the site 'sounded' like Florence, it says it's Florence, so I bought it. Then, listening to the song a few lines in-""Heyyyyy, that's not Florence! Who the hell is that?!""
VERY disappointed that there was no description saying that it is another singer. but, whatever, It was only around a dollar."
Four Stars <SEP> Great song
"Great! <SEP> Great song, great price."
Five Stars <SEP> yasss! upset they didn't release a physical copy. :(
Five Stars <SEP> great
"Five Stars <SEP> Enjoyable, listen everyday, helping with weigth loss efforts"
Great Music <SEP> The music is great. I have many Steven Halpern CDs and his music is always exceptional and this CD is no different.
Two Stars <SEP> Box damaged
Five Stars <SEP> Plays great
Five Stars <SEP> love this salsa album its one of my  favorite
definition of basic <SEP> Boring predictable and repetitive and that is this albums good qualities . Lame hipster nonsense taken to a new degree
"Glad this is finally available <SEP> When I had checked in the past it was impossible to get YUI songs legally in the US so Orange Garden Pop and Green Garden Pop showing up really made my day.

The vocals are great and the music is good too. There is variety in the songs so they don't all sound the same.  I suggest listening to some of the audio samples before buying it if you are not familiar with the artist.

I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in anime themes or just doesn't mind the songs being in Japanese.  I personally don't speak Japanese but I still enjoy the album."
"Amazing <SEP> All four of the artists here have unique styles that can interchangeably be individualized into their own category and pack the punch to back it up, however, when put together as one they create a force that is so easily in sync, they become this jazzy, witty, gritty, bowl of gumbo that you would think it preposterous to split.

Love the mellow feel of the intro and how it brings you into this subtle trance, but as the beat slowly rises it prepares you for an explosive lyrically challenging piece that you can't help but groove to. Music to the soul. Awesome piece as well as the entire album, a must have for those for an ear for masterpieces."
"Would of been very disappointed to buy this <SEP> All covers and when you start listening you miss the quality of the originals. Would of been very disappointed to buy this; lucky was able to sample it on Prime music.  The music lacks the same kick as the original tracks, the singers try to do a good job with what they have been given. I'm sure it would be passable at a karaoke bar."
"Great song.... Great Album.... Two Thumbs up.... <SEP> Great song.... Great Album.... Two Thumbs up....

Rock on Creek...."
Hot Fire!!! <SEP> Not a big Joe Budden fan but this is a hot song. Tank makes the song with the hook. High recommended.
"The Best <SEP> Feel lucky to ever have encountered this piece, years ago when the movie Meetings first came out. Happy to have the digital copy. Highly recommend!"
"JUST A TEASER <SEP> Don't waste your money on this partial EP. Short versions of new Rev Theory songs, marketed as an EP....shame on the band, and shame on Amazon. RT is going to have an album out with full versions, and hopefully, a album full of more of these great teasers. C'mon, doesn't anybody have ethics?"
Well worth the price! <SEP> It is difficult not to be impressed by the fact that not only does Will Lowry perform the vocals and play the guitar accompanying himself but that he wrote all the music and lyrics. I am enjoying listening to the words he has written and unpeeling the layers of meaning and the Scriptural validity of his writings. Highly recommended!
Through the lens. <SEP> I loved this song ever since it came out it's a great song It's a great band love everything that they do. I love the older works better works better. If I could find them I would get them.
"Pre-tay, pre-tay, pre-tay...pretty good! <SEP> I am the female Larry David. Seriously. Crazy things happen to me on the regular. So I bought the Curb theme. And now, whenever I realize that life is about to toss me yet another ""Larry-ism""...for instance...when I'm standing in the wrong check-out line, I get out my phone and fire-up this baby. Because shouldn't life have theme music? Especially the absurd parts? And this theme is pre-tay, pre-tay, pre-tay...pre-tay good!"
One Star <SEP> Wasnt the song I wanted. Deleted it.
Five Stars <SEP> That voice is remarkable. He may have been old but not his heart.
Best symphony renditions I own <SEP> The London Symphony's renditions of Christmas Classics is by far the best I own for those wanting to hear Christmas music performed by a full orchestra. The recording is crisp and sounds great and adds a little class to your Christmas music list.
One Star <SEP> i want this music and cant buy ! :@ :@ :@
Sleep tunes <SEP> Nice music selection.
Five Stars <SEP> No more insert my cd at the moment I just want to fall sleep!
Two Stars <SEP> Avant Gard.  Not for me.
"Perfect Match! You caught me! <SEP> Julie's songs reach and pull the soul upwards!

This CD is a perfect match ...
...if you enjoy hearing scripture put to a modern mix with a classically trained background.
...if you connect with music coming from a variety of life experiences.
...and Psalm 45 - the wedding psalm is exceptional in its tremendous stretch from the joy of the groom to the praise of his coming victories and skillfulness with the sword. We sometimes hear songs sung from bride to groom or groom to bride - but we're not in the century of the psalmists who had warriors on horses going to battle. Not so much.
... Then Return - Turn Your Eyes is a beautiful blend of the traditional tones of the hymn and the modern sounding heart cries and prayers of the writer.
... It's All About Glory says it all and the chorus of hallelujahs is exceptional.

Julie's professional training comes through in both the complexity of potential for becoming symphonic to the simplicity of the purest sound of voice or instrument whether using jazz undertones, or gospel, classical or indie-ish.

Julie's gifts are many. I've heard she plays eleven instruments, though I've only seen her play, mmm, piano, guitar, violin, and write music for cello, bass, timpani, etc.  She conducts a joy-filled rehearsal.

Way to go, Julie! N'est pas?

You won't be sorry you listened or bought.  Perfect match for Christmas or Birthday gift!"
This is a must have Christmas CD for your Collection! <SEP> I LOVE THIS CD!!! Lynne is awesome!
"Great mix of winter-themed originals and covers with beautiful harmonies ... <SEP> Great mix of winter-themed originals and covers with beautiful harmonies and tasteful instrumentation from this Canadian singer-songwriter. Nice change from the usual music of the Holiday season. First heard on ""The Vinyl Cafe"" on NPR. Give it a try!"
"The perfect winter holiday album for those who are a bit tired of Christmas music. <SEP> The perfect winter holiday album for those who are a bit tired of Christmas music. An interesting selection of covers from Nick Lowe, Bruce Cockburn, Gordon Lightfoot, Steve Miller Band and even Tori AMos. Plus meaningful originals like the truly heartfelt Sentimental Song."
Five Stars <SEP> good cd
"Sound Of Perfection <SEP> I groove to this sound, Its fresh, inviting yet sexy all in one. I want to hear more from Pieces Of A Dream."
"Sick <SEP> This is sick and misleading, as are most of Amazon's results for Planned Parenthood. News: this is an image of what an illegal abortion looks like, and you are responsible for it if you take legal access away."
Awesome Album <SEP> I heard Chris a month ago when he opened for Jamey Johnson. This album is good country music. I bought the album because of the song Jack and Jesus that was played at the show. The whole album is awesome.
"This one works <SEP> Went to a Sybarite 5 concert in Steamboat Springs.  While they are delightful people and showmen, and extremely talented, I didn't care for most of their music.  This piece is an exception.  Love it."
"Purchased Digital music download problem <SEP> I purchased this digital music yesterday
But every time I try to play it from my iPad or cell phone , it doesnt play. I received a message saying download error. And every time I try I get the same message.
Im hoping when I contact CS that the problem will be corrected. Very disappointed. Never had this issue before"
"5 Stars for Technique and Quality <SEP> Quickly shipped--and I mean quickly as in I ordered it on Monday and it was in my mailbox on Wednesday!  As a flamenco and classical guitarist I give Amy Hite's CD 5 stars for technique and quality of sound.  As a person who enjoys Christmas music without the singing it was a treat to be able to find a good quality CD that captured the purity of the music.  Now, if we could only tempt Amy Hite to record the Nutcracker Suite for next year."
Real Hip Hop <SEP> An awesome!! return back to authentic Hip Hop
AQUI NO CANTA GINA LEON!!!! AQUI ... <SEP> AQUI NO CANTA GINA LEON!!!! AQUI TOCA UNA ORQUESTA NO GINA LEON!!!!!! LLEVA MUCHO TIEMPO EQUIVOCADO Y NADIE CORRIGE ESTE ERROR!!!!
Love it! <SEP> I'm addicted to this song!! The lyrics are clever. Their voices are flawless. The beat is irresistible. Buy it!
"Love CD,  hate amazon music app <SEP> Love this cd however I am very unhappy with the MP3 features. You can only play this from the Amazon music app and it's using data the whole time. Very unhappy. Should have used iTunes!"
One of my favorite songs though <SEP> I bought it and downloaded it bit it never added to my computer. One of my favorite songs though.
Five Stars <SEP> <3
Five Stars <SEP> great movie better than what I expected
Quite Peaceful <SEP> I would definitely recomment this piece of music to a Lord of the Rings or classical music fan. It's a very peaceful soundtrack.
One Star <SEP> Sound to low
"Love this song <SEP> This track was not on the physical Sound track, which was disappointing, as that was the main reason I wanted the sound track. I love this song!"
Five Stars <SEP> great song
"great songs/album <SEP> great song, would recommend to anyone who enjoys listening to techno, dubstep, or dj's. great for parties or cruising. buy it"
love it <SEP> This song tells the truth about weed it makes so much sense and I hope people agree with my opinion.
One Star <SEP> No good
Five Stars <SEP> Is because I like album ....
"I like to walk through the woods listening to this <SEP> I like to walk through the woods listening to this, pretending to be a hobbit walking towards Mordor, remembering my home, in the Shire."
Five Stars <SEP> An auspicious debut!
"Evolution that makes me smile <SEP> I've known of Eric Steckel, being from North Florida, for a long time. I have always felt he should get a killer singer to be his most successful, but on this CD, his voice has matured, and I am coming to respect Eric as a singer.
 Guitar-wise, he's always been very skilled, and now his own unique sound has become deeply impressive. I had lost track for years, but Dismantle the Sun has re-energized me for Eric Steckel's music and I am going to buy everything I do not yet have, and keep up from here on out. Great music, with great depth and feeling."
Two Stars <SEP> It's ok
Five Stars <SEP> Nice song!
I DID NOT LIKE THIS VERSION <SEP> I think Kanye actually ruined a great song.  I was VERY disappointed.  I didn't realize how different this version would be.
sucks <SEP> The beginning is so stupid!! Totally ruined it. I want my money back plus interest for wasting my time!! For shame
"Wha... <SEP> sounds like crap, the vocalist cant sing and there's nothing memorable to this.....sounds like they're trying to be part of a trend, nu-metal 90s crap"
Great song <SEP> Heard this song on the guest trailer but was not on the sound track hard to track down but worth it.
"Heavy... <SEP> ""Borrowed"" and ""What Have I Done"" (both ballads) off the forever delayed Spitfire are almost painfully intense and deeply personal songs and that is when LeAnn Rimes is at her best. (see Family) She is a consummate live performer who has managed to survive and thrive in the music industry for nearly twenty years. I hope all the haters at least paid for the song before they spewed their filth and bile. Ignore the 1 star venomous (mostly female) reviews, they're not reviewing the song but the person. Imagine the music made by infallible human beings. Hard to imagine because it does not exist. It's refreshing to hear an artist go deep and lay it all out there, backlash be damned. This song or any review will not change anyone's mind about LeAnn or her music. The lover's love and the hater's hate."
child star at it's worst! <SEP> Disgusting! Go away LeAnn! You're old news and gross!  What good hearted person does the things you've done to people and think its okay?
negative 5 stars if i could <SEP> She is awful and so is this sorry excuse of an album. What a narcissist. Deplorable - in every way shape and form
"Taunting <SEP> Leann Rimes taunts Eddie Cibrians ExWife, Brandi Glanville, in every single thing She does... Dont want to give it back? Leann is a SICKO!!! Brandi Glanvilles book 'Drinking and Tweeting' gets 5 Stars!!! It's now on The NYT Best Sellers list:)"
OMG <SEP> I understand the word EXPLICIT......but the intro to Diamonds is awful. Kayne West should be ashamed of himself along with Rhianna for allowing it to be placed on her CD.
"Title is decieving, this IsA REMIX!!! <SEP> I wanted just the straight song ""Diamonds"" but instead got this crappy remix with over half the song is Kanye West rapping and not his best work...now b/c I didn't look good enough...aka...feeling like an idiot...lol...don't waste it money like I did and don't join my idiot club just because u didn't read the title right!!!"
woke up this morning by A3 <SEP> I was disappointed with this record. It was supposed to be the theme song from the sopranos but it was nothing more than a jam session in four different forms. the record arrived as presented and ahead of schedule. I would recommend amazon to anyone and I am always satisfied with the way they conduct business. its unfortunate that this record was not recorded the way it was used on HBO
A return to the good old days! <SEP> A little known band from the days of big hair and fun music makes a statement with this one! Crank it up and headbang away! We need more of this in the music world today!!
Two Stars <SEP> All the songs sound the same.
"Great Song.. MUST BUY!!! <SEP> I saw the sweet youtube video  [...]  ........and followed the link to buy the song on Amazon.  You can also buy it on iTunes. The song talks to all people showing that its not necessarily easy to be an immigrant but if you shoot high you can reach your dreams. After all, we are all immigrants.. Right?

You don't have to be an immigrant to love the beat and lyrics

In short: very inspiring!

Mucha Gracias Lapidus (i am sure Joel will be proud)
M Drebin"
A great recording. <SEP> Sung in a way that makes one feel like you are listening to an old friend.
"Awesome as always <SEP> Great EP.  It has 3 songs (including a remake of the Beatles' All I've Got To Do, which she does wonderfully).  If this was on vinyl you'd wear it out.  :)  I think This Will Be Our Year, is a real gem."
no words <SEP> there are no words for what susanna has been doing with her music. her cd SOMEDAY is one of the best releases off the year. these three oldies are an extension from her live shows.  MUST LISTEN
"Not effective due to sound mix <SEP> Nearly impossible to hear the narrator over the background. I suppose there are some subliminal messages underneath the noise, but the noise itself is anything but relaxing."
"Five Stars <SEP> Great product, I love it, arrived as expected"
One Star <SEP> Its Spanish
Two Stars <SEP> good memories
"It keeps playing in my head! Gloria Dios! <SEP> I needed this for one of the members in our congregation who does not speak alot of english. She really desired to know what the words meant in spanish. Now, she can worship with us in her own language. To God Goes All the Glory!!"
guardian angle <SEP> Excellent song.  Reminds me of my mom that passed. I listen to this all the time. I would recommend this to others.
Sweet song <SEP> I found this song while putting together a playlist for when my baby is born.  Such a sweet and beautiful song.
"ME GUSTO!! <SEP> I needed this for one of the members in our congregation who does not speak alot of english. She really desired to know what the words meant in spanish. Now, she can worship with us in her own language. To God Goes All the Glory!!"
My favorite...No question...Ty Herndon <SEP> When Ty puts his touch on a song. It's magical. His voice and talent can't be topped....by anyone. Can't wait for more music.
36 seconds? <SEP> Couldn't believe it.  I thought it was 36 minutes!  I was interested in learning about the Violet Flame.  You have a tendency to trust on Amazon good value for your money.  I think this is my very first 1 star on Amazon.
Five Stars <SEP> Must Buy Salsa Listener!
Four Stars <SEP> Very good music. ..
One Star <SEP> yuck. I downloaded the wrong one.
"Melodic Ecstasy <SEP> This album is filled with fun catchy songs featuring dynamic psychedelic acoustics and evocative melodies and lyrics. If you like Broken Bells or The Decemberists, you'll like Bob Paltrow and Burning Clover. Paltrow absolutely shines as a pianist, vocalist and guitarist, blazing new territory in the alt rock indie artist."
"Too dated to be a good party record <SEP> Imagine Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata theme reduced to 2+ minutes of piano, strings and bongos with a Latin beat, and you've got the picture.  This album is a hoot the first time through.  But it's too dated to even be a funny party record any more.  Major stereo separation as Mercury liked to do in the late 1950's."
Five Stars <SEP> IF I WASNT FOR THE  SONG:Lost i wouldnt  bought it but this  band is  amazin
"Two Stars <SEP> Performance/song is very good, I don't need the added chit-chat with the audience."
"Ok <SEP> Typical Ke$ha.  It's pretty good. Got a catchy beat and lyrics.  I listen to it at the gym, helps me get going."
"Very disappointed! <SEP> I Ordered THE MOVIE, and got a CD of songs!!!! I don't have time to send it back, so in the trash it goes!! Very disappointed!"
There's a lot of vulgar language but it's <SEP> There's a lot of  vulgar language but it's hilarious
One Star <SEP> worthless
One Star <SEP> His voice sounds shot on this live performance !
Five Stars <SEP> Really like it.
"Beautiful cover of INXS song! <SEP> I first saw Paloma Faith when she appeared on The Graham Norton Show on BBC America a few years ago. I fell in love with her voice - I've got her two albums (which are awesome!). Then, on this past year's BAFTA awards, she performed this song during the tribute to 50 years of James Bond. It's a lovely cover of the original INXS song with Paloma Faith ""flair"" thrown in. Very dramatic. Love it!"
not the original <SEP> this isn't the one from the show.its a copy by another band.feel ripped off and they should state it isn't the original.
One Star <SEP> Not the original track
"One Star <SEP> NOT the original recording, sorry...this is a re-recording of lesser quality"
"Not the Original Recordings <SEP> This is being sold as a hits anthology, but what it really is, is a CD of re-recorded music.  None of the tracks are presented in their original mixes.  Some have horrible overdubs, and re-recorded vocals that undermine the original backing tracks.  'I Get Lifted' was created looping the first couple of bars of the intro to the George McCrae 1974 recording, then overdubbing a recent piano and bass track to cover the chord changes.  Bizarre.
Overall, a poorly marketed package, and should include the disclaimer 'not the original recordings'."
Sung with emotion! <SEP> Saw her first on Jay Leno where she gave a very moving heart felt performance. This song will stick in your mind all day long.
Bought it on impulse... <SEP> Silly little ditty with annoying laughter; maybe it will grow on me but it won't get the chance until next Christmas.
"A heart touching song <SEP> I love this song. I heard it on youtube while searching clips of SOA seasons for new songs. Very emotional, heart moving. If you like songs that give you cause to think of current or past events and of clear wordsyou will like this song."
The song is great. BUT the quality of the file/recording is horrible <SEP> The song is great. BUT the quality of the file/recording is horrible. Struggle to hear it even with speakers cranked. Have had this problem with a few of the mp3 purchases. Unhappy with it
"Disappointed! <SEP> I agree with the other review - this soundtrack has some amazing music.  I downloaded the entire soundtrack, and no where did it indicate I was getting instrumental instead of the REAL things!  First time I have ever been disappointed with an amazon purchase."
"Really bad samples <SEP> I reviewed all of the samples given of the supposed movie soundtrack,
and in most cases, you get a horn intro and that's it.
I am left with no where to go, as I was not able to ACTUALLY hear any of the
music.
What a shame, this movie has some of the best drum rhythems I have heard in a long time."
"sounds distorted <SEP> This song is one of my all time favorites but this version just doesn't sound right. When Mr McCrae hits those high notes they sound distorted like this was a live recording and he was having an off night. Since that ""distorted"" portion isn't available in any samples of Rock Your Baby because it's further along in the song I took a chance and purchased another version and it was perfect, the way I remember it to be. Conclusion...I'd think twice about buying this version...all tracks sound distorted."
good song <SEP> Good song and wanted to add it to my horror music collection for Halloween.
"boring. I thought it would be good for a ... <SEP> It's just...boring.  I thought it would be good for a Halloween track to play outside for a party...kinda...haunting music as people arrived....
No.  ZzZzZz....."
"Not the actual theme song <SEP> Listening to the preview for this song, it was easy to hope that it would be an extended version of the show's theme. However, although the piano base line is reproduced, and the odd whispering voice that repeats is present, none of the heavy feedback jolts that give the true theme its character are. Its not a bad attempt, but the crescendo groan sound that is used in the place of the feedback surges just doesn't cut it."
"What fans would expect from the group, personality, talent and poetic rock. <SEP> As you might expect with Tex Tex this is a fun album to listen to.  There aren't a whole lot of bands out there capable of being entertaining and talented enough to write their own material. Tex Tex seems to have a good time doing it. Songs with a good storyline that many can identify with in some way,  a bit of humor,  the grandness of a metal symphony that holds together when performed.
Probably this album is mostly to be enjoyed by the informed and loyal,  while I would still recommend one of the studio albums for a first outing.  This is the kind of group where you will probably always be wishing that there was more out there to enjoy.  They rock,  almost poetically,  and leave you smiling and energized.  The brightest stars unfortunately shine for short times before they disappear. In Spanish."
"Another Attempt <SEP> Just another attempt by Nadya Suleman and her manager to make money. Nadya Suleman blew through millions the first year the babies were born, until she set up a beg site did she provide beds for these children. Now Ocotmom is broke, again and the children are doing what they were born to to do, make mama money. Before purchasing, goggle Nadya Suleman and the pictures of her old house...just one month ago and see where money goes, NOT to the children. Your money will NOT go to the kids, NO money has ever gone to the kids, even money they earned. Save your money and buy something for your own children."
"PORN PERFORMER & MEGA GRIFTER <SEP> Another make me rich at the expense of  neglected, sometimes hungry children. Can you imagine a Pornography Performer managing children? It's the Mother Nadya Suleman recently returning from re-hab for DRUGS 7 Alcohol who is behind this SCAM. A Fame seeker & a Porn performer using children, how low can these 2 go ? Don't enable these bottom feeders. Let then go back to their ADULT ENTERTAINMENT. Dont ' buy"
"Don't contribute to the exploitation of these kids <SEP> I saw the video for this single and the kids aren't having fun and look really sad. The oldest boy looks embarrassed to be doing this and the girl looks scared. There are 14 kid, but just 13 on the song. The autistic kid got left out.

The kids don't have the talent for this. They're going to get teased in school.

The lyrics are terrible. This is a real excerpt:

Countdown to Christmas and we are so ready
Mama told me that Santa is coming
At school we love to watch
At school we love to learn
Now I'm just waiting for Christmas to come
We're just waiting on Christmas day. Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

The more people who buy this, the more their greedy mom (who blew through millions on herself since the babies were born instead of saving any of it to raise the kids with) and manager will be encouraged to keep exploiting the kids. If you want to hear the song and see the video, go to the roctuplets-dot-com website. That's the official site and it's there for free. Also look for the Anderson Cooper review clip.

These kids are singing for their supper, but they look hungrier for love and security."
"Each of the three movements of the Saint-Saens Oboe Sonata is very different from the others--and very effective <SEP> I am focusing first on the Saint-Saens Oboe Sonata in D Major, which deserves 5 stars.  Movement 1 has a Classical--rather than Romantic--main theme: a very effective movement.  Movement 2 has a plaintive melody, mostly in solo oboe, with little accompaniment by piano: entrancing.  Movement 3: a piano arpeggio introduces a wandering oboe solo, and this schema repeats several times.  There's a clear change to a middle section with a somewhat playful oboe melody over piano accompaniment.  A piano arpeggio signals a return to the beginning plan, in A-B-A form.  The Hindemith Oboe Sonata tends to sound a bit mechanical, although the first movement is humorous, and the third movement has some beautiful moments.  The whole deserves 4 stars.  Poulenc's Two Pieces For Oboe And Piano is delightful.  The first piece is pretty, and the second is playful.  They deserve 5 stars.  The performance and sound are perfect."
They need the money <SEP> Kinda cute if you like children singing.  A great attempt for a family song time.  Not worth buying but a good try.
"Survival of the Fittest <SEP> There are only 13 of the 14 kids shown above. The autistic boy (Aiden, age 7) didn't rate a mention. Is he not part of the family anymore?

The boy with the cleft palate had surgery to repair it, and it looks like the doctor botched it. His mouth is lopsided and half his face looks paralyzed.

It's kind of cruel to put these kids on the public stage to be mocked and ridiculed."
"Makes me want to cry...and not happy tears :( <SEP> These children look so sad....the one little girl is shown 4 times because she was the only one having fun and that was because her older sister was dancing with her, of course they cut out the older sister to make it appear she was dancing on her own. The blonde/blue eyed boy is crying and hitting his brother with a Santa hat.  Three of the eight are not even shown. The oldest boy just looks plain angry.  If THIS is the best footage they have I would hate to see what the rest they didn't show looks like. Seems the so called mother would be better off to just keep living off welfare and begging for money instead of embarrassing her 14 child any more than she already has.

Sad as it is the Jimmie Kimmel version is dead on to what the real Soloman children are feeling.

If I thought for a second that buying this would help those sad children I would buy a 100 copies but I know it will never benefit them."
"How much more? <SEP> I viewed the video, my heart went out to these kids. How many more people are going to earn a buck off the backs of these children. We never saw the first steps of the toddlers, first words. birthday parties where there are ripping open gifts, laughing, having a good time. So now we are expected to spend money on 14 children who have been hidden away so their greedy mother can seek stardom and riches? Everything Nadya Suleman has done has failed, much to the thanks of a woman claiming to be her manager, who represents people who are trying to stretch their seedy 15 minutes of fame into a life time career. So now after many attempts to soar to the red carpets, Nadya Suleman is broke, away on a vacation but trying to earn money off her children, something she said  she would never do, but we all know now if Octomom's lips are moving..she is telling a lie.
Please do not buy this video, it will only encourage Nadya Suleman and her manager to continue using these children, they have been through enough."
"I'm Ready for Christmas <SEP> These poor fallen-through-the-cracks children have a mother who told journalists that her babies ""disgust"" her and called them ""eight pieces of poop"". These innocents should have been spared the life they've been forced to suffer and placed in loving homes long ago. This video looked like a Save the Children ad. I swear they were blinking out a ""HELP"" message with their eyes. Gina Rodriguez, I don't know how you live with yourself."
"Don't Allow Abusers to Make Money <SEP> Two Abuser's Nadya Suleman & Gina Rodriguez are attempting to make money off this video. All well & good if any of the 14 kids benefited from the video. But, they don't. Notice the Octuplets in the video are not wearing shoes, it's because they have none. That's right none of the  8 youngest of the Suleman tribe have nor have they ever had a pair of shoes purchased from their mother who has made millions off of these children, nor has the Manager of Suleman, A.K.A.  Octomom, with all the money she has made from them ever purchased shoes. The Octuplets are barely clothed. Notice what the are wearing in the video, t-shirts & jeans that don't fit, they don't fit because the Mother Octomom does not know what size clothing her children wear. These children live in 1 locked room, and are brought out from time to time to make money. The money goes for the Mother's Plastic Surgery, and Porn life style. The kids get bupkiss!!"
"Revolting exploitation <SEP> I frankly find this appalling. These children who deserve a nurturing childhood are seen as money-making pawns for their narcissistic and greedy mother and her even worse manager. I am disgusted that it is even offered on Amazon. I don't believe for a minute that the children will profit from this in any way, it will be funneled away and spent by Nadya Suleman in the irresponsible manner in which she has been known for since they were born. I wish the children the best and hope that someday they will no longer be exploited for financial gain and that they are loved unconditionally by sane, nurturing caregivers who have their best interests at heart. Bless you kids and hope that you have a good Christmas in spite of it all."
"Exploitive and Depressing <SEP> I saw/heard a preview of the song for free and I could not watch for more than about 40 seconds. It was way too depressing.------- The kids look miserable.-------  While the kids are cute, they don't have any talent on top of their unhappy demeanor.-------Knowing their lazy, selfish, drug using, psychopathic, and narcissistic mother blew through a lot of money and now is pimping them out (along with her manager) means those poor, pathetic looking kids are being exploited. -------All in all, skip this video unless you enjoy seeing sad eyed, miserable, exploited kids who will break your heart."
"STOP EXPLOITING 14 TRAPPED KIDS IMPOVERISHED BY GRIFTER NADYA SULEMAN <SEP> How to put the CREEPY in CHRISTMAS.

 The trapped kids recording this twisted mess were forced to deliberately put this out to further exploit the existence of 14 kids birthed solely to financially provide for ther mother.

How  they actually will be spending Christmas is right there in their sad,dead eyes. Will it be just another day while their own mother and her monster manager spend the day counting the bit of loose change this travesty brings in?

Are they going to scrape up their leavings from a meager Christmas dinner into one bowl to feed ther autistic brother, the way he has been fed before -- according to witnesses? Will they be locked shoeless and half-clothed into a cold room to spend the day unattended--not even a bathroom? Again according to witnesses
If you want to contribute to these kids' future -- do not put money into a tune put out solely to make money for the people who do not care about these kids.

The music is exactly as tuneless and joyless as you would expect a group of sociopaths and grifters to shove into the mouths of kids who have no choice but to sing it. There is your 20 words about this disgusting product."
Danceable Paloma <SEP> A little more uptempo and beat laden than most other Paloma songs you may have heard.  Song has a good hook to it.
This guys voice is amazing <SEP> I am such a fan of the song and of the singer. Gavin Degraw has the most amazing voice. It is a one-of-a-kind unique voice that has been awesome so full quality. This song rocks!
Just what I was looking for. <SEP> Amazing piece of music.
Five Stars <SEP> Damn good song!
"wow, not what I expected... left me wanting more! <SEP> Ashlee really delivers with this single. Remember the sweet Emo/pop girl who was navigating the spotlight with her heart on her sleeve just a few years ago? She's gone. Now with Ashlee's record company no longer pulling the strings, she is able to be the bold edgy grown woman she has blossomed into. I've played this track for a few friends, all of them liked it and none of them believed who was singing it.
I'm looking forward to more."
"I can't believe I'm even doing a review for this crap. <SEP> She might have taken a long break, but maybe that break should have been a lot longer. I heard this song and could not believe how repetitive it was, so I actually checked the lyrics before starting this review. She rhymes ""hair"" with ""air"" and yeah, they DO rhyme, but it's just so cliche.

With a title like ""Bat For A Heart,"" you'd think she'd come up with some more original lyrics. Then again, Bat For a Heart is kind of a mystery in itself, since she just keeps repeating ""I'm gonna bang, bang, f*** you up, Twist you up inside of my head."" Is she referring to the horizontal mambo or beating some one up? I have no clue.

Not that this is about the video for the song, but seriously? She couldn't do any better than a grainy video shot (apparently) in her living room where she just pushes her hair in front of her face and crawls around on a couch in her underwear. There are a couple random shots of her standing on pointe in what appears to be fourth position. Then, in another scene, she does echappes in sneakers to arabesque to arabesque penchee while holding onto a door jamb for dear life. Okay, she used to be an amazing ballerina, I get it, but it really doesn't fit into any other part of the video.

I really think Ashlee needs to find a new hobby. Maybe since she's a mommy, she could make special, expensive diapers like Jessica Alba. Or pick up painting?"
"Really?! <SEP> Is this a joke? Unlike the other (current) reviewers i'm not a rabid Ashlee fan, i just saw the video randomly on another site, it's crazy bad! Like she is trying to be a mix between herself, Gaga & Peaches. i mean it is REALLY awful. Like i'm amazed by how truly terrible it is."
Ashlee is back in the game <SEP> This is a phenomenal first effort of self-production. This is a great direction for her music and sound; showing maturity and growth. I look forward to seeing what comes next.
"Some pretty good songs <SEP> I've always been a fan of EPIC Score. I own a few of their vols. This one I would say is more like Vol 11.5 rather than 12 - it doesn't hold me to repeat the album, but it's enough to make me want to LARP with a giant battle axe, while covered in Sex Panther (works 60% of the time...EVERYTIME) and just pwn peeps."
"Can't wait for their album! <SEP> I met one of the members at a school event, and that's where I found the band. It's a pretty slick boy band, so if you're a fan of that then you'll love these guys. I'm excited for their album this year, and can't wait for it!"
"Wonderful! <SEP> Kevin Wallace is a wonderful musician who has a great heart for God.  His desire is to glorify God and bring people closer to God through his music.  He is making a positive impact on many, many people."
"An all-time classic guitar duo at their best <SEP> Is there a dumber topic than trying to list the ""best guitarists of all time?""  Magazines do it all the time, and countless internet threads have started with the question, written in all-caps, with pointless and excessive punctuation.  What's the dumbest thing about how these lists are constructed?  Is it the predictable but lamentable adherence to rock with maybe a bit of blues?  How about the myopic focus on guitarists who have recorded recently?  At least that one is predictable for anyone familiar with the ""availability heuristic.""  For my money, the most entertainingly dumb aspect of these lists is that they tend to be populated almost exclusively by Americans and Brits (sorry, Aussies like Jeff Lang and Geoff Achison tend to get no love from the Americans).  Music fans in Mali may know about the astonishing virtuosity of Djelimady Tounkara, but Americans... not so much.  Similarly, music fans from the Balkans may know about Vlatko Stefanovski from his Macedonian jazz-rock fusion band Leb i Sol, but Americans... not so much.  Yet, both he and fellow Macedonian Miroslav Tadic are virtuosos on a level unfathomable to us mere mortals.  Their acoustic duo albums began with Krushevo, showcasing Macedonian folk tunes with flourishes from classical, jazz and flamenco (Miroslav teaches at Cal Arts, so there's nothing he can't do).  They have only recorded a few albums, and most are hard to find in the US, but once you get bit by that Krushevo bug, you want more and more.  This album, recorded live, may be my favorite.

Tracks:
1. Dafino vino crveno
2. Izlezi Vido
3. Jovano, Jovanke
4. Ej ti momce Ohridjance
5. Kasapsko oro
6. Proseta se Jovka Kumanovka
7. Kalesh Andjo
8. Eleno, kerko
9. Anadolu oyun havasi

The track listing suggests that you may already have some of these tunes.  Do you need more versions?  Yes.  Vlatko and Miroslav really stretch out here, and push each other to new heights of intensity and beauty, combining all of the fire of flamenco, the precision of classical, and the unique beauty of Macedonian folk music.  And they aren't alone.  They are joined on several tracks by Theodosii Spassov on flute, and more importantly, Swapan Chaudhuri on tabla.  The Indian tabla adds a fantastic new dimension to the Macedonian-based music, and on the last track, Chaudhuri gets a big chance to show his prodigious chops.  The flute for me is just kind of there, along with some vocalizations.  However, Vlatko and Miroslav have never played with more fire in the gut, and Chaudhuri gives the music an even more eclectic feel.

As a warning, the accompanying DVD won't play on a region 1 player.

Further listening:  Goran Ivanovic, and mandolin player Radim Zenkl (from a bit to the north)."
Fantastic <SEP> I really like this group. There is a depth and complexity to the Brilliance that stands alone in the world of worship music. They are a rare treat. Quiet and contemplative music full of rich lyrics and smooth singing.
A new favorite at our house! Even the kids ask for it! <SEP> We are thoroughly enjoying it! There are songs that the kids get up and dance to but it's calm enough to make great music during dinner too.  The musicianship is great and we are looking forward to their next offering!
LOVED IT. COULD UNDERSTAND ALL THE LYRICS AND LIKED ... <SEP> LOVED IT.  COULD UNDERSTAND ALL THE LYRICS AND LIKED THEM.
wonderful jazz <SEP> found out about Pierre's group through a French conversational group my mom actually attended... turned out along with being an amazing French teacher his jazz trio is absolutely fantastic. I have 3 of his discs including THE CRUSH and all are wonderful additions to my collection. Really soulful and thoughtful playing with passion and execution with a slant all his own. Magnifique!
"Five Stars <SEP> If you're a Chevelle fan, this is a must have."
"Enh. Just buy the 2-3 good tracks. <SEP> I like Tyrone Wells but regretted this purchase, there's only one or two songs I really like. You could just buy ""This Love"" and ""Already Falling,"" which are both the kind of love song that stick in your head and don't leave for three days. ""You and Me on Top of the World"" is one of his more upbeat, fun songs, similar to others but still worth a listen. The rest is, as far as I'm concerned, syrupy schlocky or softcore religious."
Terrible! But camp so I gave it an extra ... <SEP> Terrible!  But camp so I gave it an extra star.  It is so bad it's funny.  I like to play it to see my friends reaction.
"One Star <SEP> My CD player couldn't ""read"" the CD."
"Love It! <SEP> I am a big fan of Richard Smallwood! It Is Well is one of my favorite hymns and he plays it, along with Come Ye Disconsolate, skillfully!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love the way this kids sing a lot of talent in one place it's a great buy
"WARNING!!! THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDING!!!! <SEP> Just a warning... This is re-recorded. Amazon has the original, but this one is not it. I made the mistake of paying for this one and was disappointed. Hoping Amazon will see this and offer to make it right by at least marking this one as a re-recording.

If you're looking for the original, use this link instead: [...]"
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
One Star <SEP> My daughter the horse lover found it annoying and begs me to NOT put it on
"Maybe you should try something else <SEP> This one is as creepy as the first. We listened to it once and my daughter said ""no"". It is dull and says maybe a lot. Maybe you are in a field of flowers, maybe there is a horse there, maybe it is brown. What the hell is it already woman? I understand what they were trying to do and it will work for some people, but my daughter is autistic and very literal. All this maybe crap is just annoying."
"CD definitely helps my kids with their sleep <SEP> I so love the concept of this CD.  It makes so much sense to me as a mom and a counselor who has a 7 year old who struggles a lot with worry.  The first track walks the listener through a happy scene about ponies, the next track teaches the listener calm breathing and calm thinking techniques, the last track has soft, mesmerizing music to promote sleep and relaxation.  There are just a couple of things that I do not like.  In the first track about the ponies, my kids were all relaxed imagining their pony scenes, and then a lady starts singing.  The singing and the pitch of the song were such an abrupt change from the pony story that my kids and I were all startled and jumped.  It definitely interrupted their relaxation.  The singer of the songs is not very good.  It comes across a bit shrill and pitchy.  Also, the CD uses synthesized music at times that sounds like organ music at a funeral.  It is kind of a strange choice for music.  So besides the singing and the funeral-like music, I really like the CD.  As far as does it do what it is trying to accomplish, I would definitely say, ""yes.""  My kids love the pony story.  My 4 year old who has a very hard time settling down at bedtime usually falls asleep during the calm breathing/calm thinking track.  My kids like having the mesmerizing music played in their room all night as they sleep.  So I would definitely recommend it if you have kids who worry at night and have trouble going to sleep."
"Song is great <SEP> Jay Z is great.  Even though he is older now, his music is still tops in the industry.  This song is the shiz."
"Pre-schoolers love it! <SEP> Use this for my pre-school class while teaching simple tap steps. They all get up and move to this one, even the ones who say they don't like to dance,"
Five Stars <SEP> Better than the original!!
"One Star <SEP> Great performance, but very poor quality recording. No bass so you absolutely cannot feel the cannons."
One Star <SEP> I found a better quality version off of a YouTube video...
Keep shopping for 1812 Overture <SEP> This recorded way too quiet so even with the volume cranked it is still not loud enough. I downloaded another song at the same time that did not have this error.
"Meh <SEP> Love the song, but it would have been nice to know that only 1 chorus would be sung and the rest is instrumental."
"THIS is what I have been waiting for? Not exactly! <SEP> Maybe I am being overly literal here. But I am seeing remarks to the effect that these downloadable MP3s make up the finest set of classical music recordings ever.  Sorry but it simply isn't true.

Perhaps they meant that this was one of the finest ""selections"" of popular classics ever assembled in one set. Or that this set contained some of the finest ""performances"" of this music. I would agree with and endorse either of those statements.

But that is not what they said. What they said was that this set contained the finest RECORDINGS ever. The truth is that these recordings leave A LOT to be desired.

They are very low amplitude. At times the tape hiss and rumble intrude conspicuously on the music. There is no excuse for THAT, not with the software tools that are now available for elimination of such noise.

Really the only thing this set has going for it is that the original LPs from which they were taken seem to have been quite clean and undamaged. But I seriously doubt that the phono system used for the transfers was of much account.

We had this set of LPs at home when I was a kid - and I still have them. The basic recording quality of the originals was actually pretty good.  But the set of LPs that I have suffered a lot of abuse during their early years.

Even so, I transferred my own set over to digital format (FLAC) a couple of years ago. To effect this transfer I used what most people would consider a high end phono system, preamp and dedicated digital recorder. I then massaged the files with Audacity software to eliminate hiss and reduce surface noise as much as possible (even the clicks & pops). But there is only so much you can do in cleaning up damaged LPs.

So... I was hoping that a high quality remastered set of these recordings would become available.  But this isn't it.  Despite the flaws of my original LP set, there is simply more life in the transfers that I did and they sound a whole lot more like music.

The real shame is that now that this set is available for sale all hope of a professional remastering, such as those done for the Mercury Living Presence, Decca Sound and RCA Living Stereo sets is gone."
"Great Song, Great Version! <SEP> One of my all time classical pieces and this orchestra does a great job from start to finish.  I listen to it to relax, paint, or just feel good!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great rap song with good lyric
Five Stars <SEP> Perfect theme song to a video game buy the perfect band.
Awesome song. It got me feeling really nostalgic and ... <SEP> Awesome song.  It got me feeling really nostalgic and wanting to play Sonic CD again.  I love it to bits.
"So boring I could have fell asleep.....ZZZ <SEP> Not nearly as good as previous years. Boring and never listen to.

Instead, get Sven Vaths live sets from previous years. Recommend Deep Dish Global Underground Toronto for an instant classic."
too short. <SEP> This piece is 36 seconds long. This is a major ripoff for .99 cents. Amazon needs to put the length of every song before we buy.
"Disappointed... <SEP> I'm a big fan of the Defected label and of their 'most rated' series, I get their compilations very regularly as I am DJ myself.  However,they dropped the ball really low on this one. Either I am getting old or the music is getting worse... or Andy Daniell did not do such a good job selecting tracks on this compilation.  Save your money and wait for the next 2013 compilation."
"Five Stars <SEP> I'm a great fan of Baroque music, and this is some of the best."
One Star <SEP> This is a poor imitation of the real Crepitation Contest
Awesome soundtrack <SEP> Superb composition!
One Star <SEP> Got wrong thing just a movie dvd
I did not get what I ordered <SEP> I thought I was getting the song but I only got the instrumentals and there is no way to get my money back. If I want the song I intended to buy I would have to buy it all over again but I won't because it'll probably be the same nonsense.
Poor sound quality <SEP> Don't know how to put it any other way. It sounds like it was recorded from a bad tape player.
Not up to date <SEP> I took my grandkids to visit Gettysburg this week and unfortunately this CD has not been updated since the new visitor center had been built.  So the directions getting to the visitor center were the old visitor center. And since that old center is not around anymore it was a little confusing from the new visitor center. Here's the directions tell you to start and end at the visitor center.  The starting and stopping at places to watch on the CD were very nice and informative. We ended up not even finishing because we got turned around somewhere. Part of that could have been my fault but we were a little upset at the very beginning when we were going in the opposite direction and then had to backtrack to find the audio tour. I think this would be great if it was made with the new visitor center in mind
"very low volume..... <SEP> very low volume.....,How can i express my dissatisfaction in 20 words...the file is bad, the file is less than perfect...i wasted a dollar...won't buy from here again"
... band at the Rye Bread festival in upstate NY Great music Paul melted my face off with his violin ... <SEP> Saw this band at the Rye Bread festival in upstate NY  Great music  Paul melted my face off with his violin and moog theramin  NICE !!!
"One Star <SEP> I love the show, but you got to be kinding me charging $299.99 for a CD!"
We Say KaTonga! <SEP> KaTonga was a grand broadway style show that performed daily in the Moroccan Palace Theater! It will be missed forever and this is a great item to remember it and listen to all the classic songs that so many of us feel in love with!
Not full song <SEP> Rip off deleted song right after only 2 minutes long !!!
One Star <SEP> Sucked! Not the original full version. Why would I want to pay for half a song? BS!
"The wrong one... <SEP> I found the one I was looking for...This was the short one and also was only about two minutes.  The one I wanted, which was neither on Amazon nor iTunes, was 3:35."
My favorite all time Zappa song <SEP> My favorite all time Zappa song. I wish there was a version without the talking. I could use it for meditation!
A keeper. <SEP> First album that is good.
Five Stars <SEP> great song
Five Stars <SEP> ok
Incredible track <SEP> This one is simply blazing in intensity. The interplay between the vocal lines adds to the feeling and helps to makes this a very moving song.
One of my favorite love songs <SEP> For years I looked for this love song. It was a song on a mixed cassette tape that was made for my mom. I was very happy to purchase it! Thanks Amazon!
Five Stars <SEP> Loved it
"one of the best rock recordings I've heard <SEP> Superb guitar skills, one of the best rock recordings I've heard. The rest of the band gives solid performances."
Wonderful Ballad <SEP> This is a wonderful song.  One of my favorite songs from the 1980's.  I am glad it is available as a download.
Manheim Steamroller Christmas Album <SEP> Their Christmas Albums are great.  So good you'll want to listen year round. I highly recommend. Listen to a few of the free clips and you will see.
"Funny <SEP> I got this around Christmas time.  I usually don't buy any of Shane Dawson's songs.  This one was funny, but had a meaning behind it unlike most of his other ones."
Five Stars <SEP> love it
love her <SEP> i love her to death she have a powerful vocie and she is one of a kind and stuff.... <3
I didn't get the 50 piece lamp work murano <SEP> I didn't  get  the 50 piece lamp work murano either
"GI rapper has skills! <SEP> I grew up in Gary IN.  Freddie's skills brings back memories of when I still lived in Gary.  There is an attitude that comes from people that grew up in that environment and Freddie captures it perfectly.  Art does not influence society, it reflects society and Freddie is a perfect reflection of what living and growing up in Gary Indiana is truly like."
Five Stars <SEP> I loved this so much I bought more to be given as Christmas gifts.
Not Sunday Best <SEP> This compilation is more like the worst of Sunday Best.  Poorly produced and the songs poorly chosen.  Surely there were much better choices that reflect what Sunday Best represents.
"Sunday Best Top 10 <SEP> All the these performers are outstanding. They brought their ""A"" game every time their foot hit the stage, over and over. Highly recommended !!!"
Freebee Xmas give away in 1975 <SEP> UGGGGgh!  As a child the catholic school I attended gave these poor records out to us kids. If you get 35.00 bucks for this I would be amazed someone wanted this so bad.  Guess it's a matter of perspective.
"Jingle Bell Rock <SEP> Everyday Sunday makes me smile! Their version of this song is so good! Took me 2 seconds of listening to know that I had to buy it! Love,love,love it!!"
Shane Dawson Christmas <SEP> Great song! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! LISTENED TO IT 10 billion TIMES! <3 Definitely worth buying. Best xmas song ever. :)
Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic 1990's classic Euro dance..
"but graphics seem grainy and crappy. This might be part of original design <SEP> The vinyl is beatifull, but graphics seem grainy and crappy. This might be part of original design."
Not his songs <SEP> Not his songs
"BUYER BEWARE!!! <SEP> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

This is NOT a legitimate 'The Best of Al Jarreau' collection!

Notice that the title of this album is The Best of AL (2 capital letters) Jarreau, and the cover photo is of a vinyl record on a turntable, no photo of the artist himself. That's a clue that this is NOT AT ALL what it appears to be.

The release date of THIS album is November 11, 2012, yet there are 40 reviews attributed to THIS album, dating back to December 1998!

AMAZON, TELL ME HOW THAT IS POSSIBLE!!!

Several of the 2013 reviews allegedly for THIS ALBUM list some of Al's most popular songs that are not even IN this compilation:
After All, and the theme from 'Moonlighting'.

The majority of these tracks are Al Jarreau covers of Bill Withers songs. I love both Al Jarreau and Bill Withers, but this SHOULD be named ""Al Jarreau sings Bill Withers Plus Bonus Tracks.""

As a compilation that has not been remastered, recording quality is highly variable. Many tracks sound like there is cotton stuffed into the speakers.

And while you're searching, here is another album labeled 'Best of', yet this 'Platinum Collection' is once again, Al Jarreau singing Bill Withers songs.

http://www.amazon.com/Best-Al-Jarreau/dp/B003KMCMBU/ref=sr_1_68?ie=UTF8&qid=1416413209&sr=8-68&keywords=Al+Jarreau"
Four Stars <SEP> My 6 year old loves this song!
"Son loves it! <SEP> This was purchased by my son with his birthday money.  He loves it, and I have to admit it's pretty clever!"
One Star <SEP> I didn't buy this because it isn't Christmas music. Duh!
One Star <SEP> ok
"Not a fan <SEP> To be honest I did download this song as a freebie.  This song just does not speak to me.  There is nothing that pops out whether its the musicality, the lyrics, the composition.  This song just doesn't get me excited."
Ok <SEP> I have never listened to this not sure where it came from. I hate to give a bad review but want to be honest.
Five Stars <SEP> Loveeeeeeeeee This Beautiful Song !!
"Five Stars <SEP> Brubeck, what else can you say?"
Five Stars <SEP> Sublime did it with this song!
"Too quuuuiiiiiiiiiiieeeetttt........ is there actually anything playing??? <SEP> 1 * for bad sample - I would never buy this sample alone.........I can't hear anything!!  It's a shame :(  I love cello and I'm just discovering how beautiful the sorrowful sounds of the cello...which are all but non-existent in this clip.

Fix please."
nice collection <SEP> Excellent collection of classical guitar music. I liked it so much that I downloaded it to my phone to have to listen to on business trips. Worth the pitance of price they offer it for here on Amazon. A great value in my opinion. Definite purchase! Definite five stars!
Rolling well <SEP> A good companion collection that rolls off the chords with easy and distinction.  Many pieces worth double or shuffle listen.
"Like you've never heard her before! Amazing voice. <SEP> I've always enjoyed Martha Wash, she has an amazing voice and delivery. Let's face it - she can belt out a tune like nobody's business - let's be real now...not even Mariah can compete with her. LOL!

But on this song she holds that all in and just sings...like an angel. No vocal acrobats. No long winded runs. Just making music from her vocal cords and instrumental background. She just sings with this beautiful melodic voice that, for the first time I can remember, showcases her true abilities as a vocal artist. With her phrasing, delivery, strong but soft presence, she sings a story right on par with Elton John's ability to sing a story.

I think it is an amazing song and touches the heart of anyone I've forced to listen HA HA. The song touches on strength, forgiveness, triumph and appreciation with wide eyed wonder. Some of my ""girls as friends"" were in tears after listening to this song - immediately relating it to relationships with their boyfriends or parents or someone else who has a special place in their life and heart. It's a modern and tasteful wedding, mother/son, father/daughter, lover/partner song that's meaningful and could only add to a special day."
New Talent <SEP> Lena's music is refreshingly contemporary yet at the same time very sophisticated. She has a soulful honest way about her that is very addictive. Can't wait to hear more from her!
"Don't Stop Believin' (Journey Cover) - Single <SEP> Why I didn't sample this I don't know, but this ""singer"" is no where even in a close category as, the ONE AND ONLY STEVE PERRY!"
"Blue Stone - always a pleasure <SEP> Was disappointed this didn't come out as a CD, but I guess I can understand as only an EP, but I still like having a tangible disk I can display, especially with such lovely cover art as this album has! If a CD is released of this EP, I will surely add it to my collection!"
"Sarea forever! <SEP> Sarea is an awesome band!
I think you all should check them out!!!
download this..you will not be dissapointed....I promise youu!"
"I didn't listen to this version before I made the ... <SEP> I didn't listen to this version before I made the purchase, my mistake.
I do not care for this version of the song Tobacco Road."
"Really Really Bad <SEP> Barely listenable, the interviewer was dry and lifeless.  The facts and stories were old and nothing new, and there wasn't a lick of a guitar throughout.  A utter waste of my time and money."
"Christian Christmas music <SEP> this is a great song. Lifts your spirits to the heavens .very uplifting,keep me in the Christmas moment,reminds me what Christmas is all about"
Truck Stop Blues.... <SEP> Real Country from BR5-49.  They know how to write/choose a good song and play it well.  Wish they were still together.
Terrific singer of jazz standards <SEP> not as well known as she should be so this huge list for so little is worth buying for your jazz standards collection
A Classic from Number 9 of the Wu-Tang Clan... <SEP> I like the slowed down beats Al Green style.....a classic love it....plus a track with ODB five stars no doubt...
"Very dissapointed <SEP> If this is all MK can pull from his soul in the last several years then MK has smoked himself silly.
Save your money and get the Czarface album with Inspectah Deck and ESO."
"starts off decently and then drastically goes downhill... <SEP> PRODUCTION: 4/8
LYRICS: 4/8
CONTENT: 4/8
ENJOYMENT: 3/8

Selling My Soul starts off decently and then drastically goes downhill after the Part 2, and it does not really recover after that. It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware."
"A Thanksgiving turkey <SEP> This is presumably an Alison Gold wannabe. She's quite successful, too. The turkey mushed potatoesIt's Thanksgivinghey, hey. That's about the level of the lyrics. And know what? The rapper from Gold's song Chinese Food is here too, this time dressed as a turkey! Believe it or not, but Patrice Wilson is the producer behind these  hopefully  very deliberate turkeys. Only two stars for you this time, Mr. Wilson, but I hope the Thanksgiving dinner tasted well, ha ha."
Hilariously horrible. <SEP> My headline says it all.  I heard it on a Sports Talk show last week.  The host knew all of the words.  I was flabbergasted/intrigued.
A treasure in American music <SEP> Discovered the wonderful Jimmie Ridgers when searching for mood music for a theater play set in the Western U.S. in the 1930's. He is a real treasure of American music.
Two Stars <SEP> not as good as her previous work
Four Stars <SEP> almost as good as the original
"why no cd? <SEP> i did not get to hear any of her new music,because it is not available on cd,and i am not inclined to buy one song at a time.i really like her music,but why not make it available for everyone,on a format for everyone? imogen cheap?"
"Best from recent Imogen <SEP> I've been an Imogen fan for a while, first from Frou Frou, then her debut solo album. However, I was a bit disappointed in Ellipse - the album was Imogen, but not progressive enough for me. It was a bit too much of same and that made it less interesting to my ear.

I love this new release though. You Know Where to Find Me ranks up there with her best work, in my opinion."
"Tired <SEP> Tori Amos used to be innovative and noteworthy for her originality. Now she's letting the ""Flavor"" of the moment to remix her mediocre efforts. It is sad."
"Incredible mixes with amazong FLAVOR! <SEP> These are hands down the best Tori dance mixes in will over a decade!  Download, crank up the volume, dance and enjoy!!!"
Spellbinding <SEP> Pollen is a maelstrom of electronic wizardry. Those familiar with Aes Dana's work will find no disappointment here. This album manages to be equally excelsior for Working Out or Chilling Out... Just don't be Left Out.
Two Stars <SEP> Not very good remake into a Christmas song
"Pleasant <SEP> Disappointing mix of songs and artists, doesn't seem to represent the genre well, pleasant as background music."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome!
Beautiful instrumental hymn arrangements for background music <SEP> Beautiful instrumental arrangement to traditional hymns that work great for background or interlude music.
"not enough fidelity or quality <SEP> I was dissapointed with these guys after only one spin.  Not much more to say at this time, OK?  n"
"Muy buen CD <SEP> Esta cantante tiene una muy buena voz, y la cancin Wonder es fantstica en sus dos versiones."
Educational and Inspirational to an aspiring student of Hula <SEP> Inspirational as I am a student of Hula.  I appreciated the deeper meaning of Hula acknowledged. I especially enjoyed Auntie.
"Horrible sound quality.  Amazon should be ashamed. <SEP> This is my favorite aria, from my favorite opera and composer.  I cannot believe Amazon couldn't publish an MP3 from a digitally mastered recording.  At least don't give us something with vinyl needle pops recorded by an amateur.  For shame.  I've got better on my own vinyl records and cassette tapes."
Great vocals <SEP> Sunday Wilde has a uniquely gifted voice that plays well into the bluesy songs she sings. Highly recommend this CD.
"The one and only with the lost 3rd verse added to it <SEP> Nicely done with the forgotten 'third verse' added to it! I bet no other rendition has that verse, except that there's the other with the lost 2nd verse done actually by Peebo Bryson and Vanessa Williams. Someday soon I'll find that one too

PS: For the record, there were five verses originally written back in the 1940s during WWII"
Five Stars <SEP> More great music from Audiomachine!
love it <SEP> This is the first time I use amazon to purchase music. It was so easy and I love this song!
Loved It! Loved It! Loved it! <SEP> Loved this CD.  First heard it on satellite radio and hunted it down.  It met all my expectations and more so.
Five Stars <SEP> Sweet and underrated!
"The Power Of The Riff Compels Me... <SEP> After becoming aware of John Lancaster via his debut solo album, Phantom Moon  which features guest vocals from the one and only dUg Pinnick on a killer track called When Shadows Grow Teeth  I have been highly anticipating a follow-up. Enter Crash Test In Progress, a new six-song EP that is the very definition of all-killer/no-filler. Lancasters chops as a guitarist are undeniable, and displayed nicely here without ever venturing into the realm of show-offy overkill. The real killer here, though, is Lancasters voice, which calls to mind Pinnick, his Kings X bandmate Ty Tabor, and journeyman hard rock vocalist-at-large John Corabi (The Scream, Motley Crue, et al) in equal measure, without ever aping any of them (or anyone else, for that matter). Crash Test In Progress offers up a heady mixture of melody and aggression that will instantly appeal to fans of any of the aforementioned bands, as well as gone-but-never-to-be-forgotten greats like Galactic Cowboys, Saigon Kick, and Mindset. Put another way, this record will instantly appeal to anyone who has even a remote interest in pure, honest, guitar-heavy rock n roll. I could go on  and on and on and on  but Crash Test In Progress is nothing if not a record that speaks for itself, so Im just going to urge you to visit Lancasters website and have a listen. If you find yourself too wrapped up in the riffery to say thank you, thats OK. I understand completely."
"Watch out Weird Al  youve got some competition here! <SEP> In 2009, by chance, I caught a ""showcase"" by Mike Rayburn at an Arts Presenters conference and figured I'd give him a look over. For the next - all too brief - 20 minutes, Mike had me rolling off my chair with laughter. This guy knows his pop culture inside and out! But between the laughter from his oddball pairings of country and heavy metal (Dan Folgelberg sings AC/DC) he performed some amazing music using just the fret board on his guitar. This led me to Mikes CD Live at Carnegie Hall  see my review under that title. I then found the DVD of his show and loved that even more. (You can find those on his website)

Now Mike  who spent more than a year with regular gigs in Vegas  in jumping on the pop music pardody wagon, that , until now, has been the kingdom of Weird Al Yankovic. And he does a fine job of it too! Starting off with the title track, his take on Taylor Swifts you Belong With Me, he aims mostly at recent songs by Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars and Talo Cruz, but reaches back to the 1980s for The Clashs Rockin the Casbah  here retitled Rocin The Snack Bar about playing in a casino. For Ducks in the Wind, Mike leaves the lead vocals to his friend Buzz Sutherland. Cute if you like duck voice imitations.

Mike plays a variety of guitars (often multiple guitars on the same track) and hes backed by a crew of Nashville musicians.
Things get more serious for the closer on this 12-track CD: Mikes solo guitar arrangement of Queens Bohemian Rhapsody. If youve not hear him play an instrumental before, this will show you that hes more than a comedian.

Mike is ""classically trained"" and has some non-comedy CDs out as well which I discovered and enjoyed and con recommend.
If you like Weird Al, youll definitely like this one. The problem with parodies of current hits is often that they become irrelevant as time goes on. That might be the case for this album. But, for now, I really like it. Its only available as an MP3 download on Amazon but you can hear samples. As far as I know the physical CD is available on Mikes Website.
The maybe, like me, you'll find yourself one of ""Mike's people"".

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

""Anything Phonographic"""
"Amazon did it again! Very satisified! <SEP> Excellent ! I bought different songs from the album from Amazon. Turned out wonderful. Price
Cannot be beat."
Leggo <SEP> This song is alright.  Its not what i thought it would be. but it gets me through the day with my other music.
Amazing!! <SEP> Soulful and classic! A great talent. Can't wait to hear the rest of the album. I'm sure it will be well worth the wait.
"but nice worship, nonetheless <SEP> Not what I had expected, but nice worship, nonetheless."
Five Stars <SEP> A wonderful song of love.
"Like Spirit's version of All Along The Watch Tower <SEP> Like Spirit's version of All Along The Watch Tower, this is an excellent cover of a Jimi Hendrix song. It's a little more psychedelic than Jimi's version and all the better for being so. It's a great addition to my MP3 ""walking the neighborhood"" collection."
"Wrong Song <SEP> Not sure qhat song I got, but it wasn't either version of Marvin's Room"
"Amazing! <SEP> Where was this song in all my previous Christmases????
This is an absolutely beautiful rendition. It is modern, yet very spiritual. It describes the hope and love that the special Baby  was to bring to our world... and its directed to His Mom, Mary!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Soft and Sporadic with Sonic Treats A Plenty <SEP> This is really nice ambient down tempo a la the German Label Electrolux and their group Fresh Moods.  It's great music for contemplation, yoga, reading, or studying.  But it's not cheesy like music for specific purposes can be.  Plug Research has always supported artists who use electro elements to create unique music.  I love it."
Five Stars <SEP> Definitely had all of the HITS!
"Horrible Audio Quality <SEP> If you're an audiophile who has listened to this record -- on an original 60s Columbia Stereo LP -- then don't buy this!
I thought a CD version would produce a little more bottom end because lower frequencies were rolled-off on 60s LPs.
I never made it that far -- the harsh, near-distorted mids and highs ruined the whole listening experience. I thought a cable disconnected or my gear was having a problem. The CD is THAT bad."
"Peter Godwin, where are you. <SEP> Sorry Eloquent.  I'm comparing your vertion to Peter Godwin's version. There is no comparison. His version was a great 80's dance song."
"Five Stars <SEP> just a great son, and singer"
Not original version. <SEP> Love the original song but this was remade and didn't have the characterizations of original. OK but not the one I had expected.
"D'Oyly Carte in the glory days <SEP> One of *four* complete G&S operas recorded by the D'Oyly Carte company in the year 1950. Yes, it's mono, and features the then-standard cuts, but all the performers (except Drummond-Grant) did these roles on stage. The sound may be better in later versions, but I like the sense of character, and the vocal acting, in this performance."
"Unimpressive Album <SEP> There is nothing really wrong with this CD, I just didn't care for it.  It is performed by three guys calling themselves ""The Smooth Jazz Instrumental Band"", one guy playing electric guitar, one guy playing rhythm, and one guy playing string bass.  They are all quite competent, but they are not virtuosos, and so the songs end up sounding exactly the same.  I suppose that is one of my knocks on the CD - it comes off as sounding rather amateurish.  Now there is nothing wrong with the performances or the recording; it just sounds boring."
"Don't buy it! <SEP> Did not like! Very different from jazz, Smooth  jazz or Bossa nova Christmas music."
Not the original version I was expecting. <SEP> This is a very funny song but the original is better by far than this remade version. Thanks much ~
Great song!!! <SEP> Great dance beat and lyrics!!!! you will love the remix!! at least i do!!! Go Krewella at being the best!!!
Best Song Ever <SEP> You will absolutely love this song.  What a message and no one brings the vocals out like the Statler Brothers. It will be your favorite too.
Not bad if this is what you are looking for <SEP> Did not meet expectation. Was not what we thought it was.
"Great Kids CD with a Good Message <SEP> My girls (4 and 2) LOVE this CD! We saw Go Fish in concert about a year ago, and I bought this for them for Easter. And I definitely don't mind listening to it. SO much better than Old McDonald for the 1000th time!"
Five Stars <SEP> I was able to use this download exactly as I wanted!
Fun song! <SEP> Great song!
cute Christmas Son <SEP> I found this song on the movie 12 Dates of Christmas. It's a cute non-traditional Christmas song. My kids love it too.
"Early 80s Fresno hardcore from teen punkers Maniax (from ""Not So Quiet"" comp <SEP> If you've ever wanted to hear more from early 80s Fresno teen punkers the Maniax, whose track ""Off to War"" appeared on the seminal 1982 Alternative Tentacles West Coast hardcore punk comp ""NOT SO QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"" & has been a favorite for three decades, you've hit the motherlode with this new compilation album!  The Maniax's ""THE LOST TAPES"" collects for the first time ever 30 (!) early demos and live tracks recorded at home in Fresno during 1980-82.  Some of these songs were first broadcast around the world on the iconic ""MAXIMUMROCKANDROLL"" punk rock radio show, where Maniax songs were regularly played to raves by TIM YOHANNON, JEFF BALE, JELLO BIAFRA (DKs) and the gang.  Now you can hear the REST OF THE STORY.  Recorded with one amp, one mic, and a held-held cassette recorder, this is ""DIY"" punk ethos at its best - and a time capsule for all those ""bedroom rockers"" that littered the landscape back in the day when punk was truly punk.  Standout tracks include (3) LIVE tracks recorded at the ""Fab Mab""/MABUHAY GARDENS, plus ""Slit Wrists,"" ""Xmas Drone,"" ""Last House on the Left,"" ""You Left Me,"" ""Stupid Fashion Scam, ""Corporate Crucifix,"" and their ode to the late Plasmatics lead singer ""Wendy O.""  Every home should have one!"
"Joan and Bobby <SEP> Great cover, really chill and nice to listen to when you are relaxing in a way that is different than their other chill songs."
"Walk off the Earth is great <SEP> These songs are the direct sound lifted off of their great youtube videos. As such, the quality of the recording is hit and miss. Still a lot of fun, even if there are some more fun to listen to than others. Love these guys. This album is mainly their earlier recordings."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song walk off the earth does an fantastic job playing and singing it
wrong CD <SEP> i love Chicken Hill.... but this isn't the CD i was looking for....and i bought it anyways.
Five Stars <SEP> It is absolutely superb music of the soul!
Four Stars <SEP> Nice recording and a good introduction to the work of Komitas.
"Great Komitas in an intimate way <SEP> Delicious piano pieces by the great Armenian composer.

I have rated it with 5 starts because: these are beautiful surprising works, the recording is nice and the interpretation is neat."
"Hauntingly beautiful - a must-own <SEP> I would urge anyone who knows about Komitas and would be interested in a first-class performance OR who has never heard of this world-renowned composer but would like an introduction OR who just plain loves the piano, to get this CD.
Komitas traveled among the villages of historic Armenia (eastern Anatolia) in the late 19th century methodically collecting Armenian folk music, notating thousands of songs and dances that might have otherwise been lost. A very informative survey of his life and work, including notes on the 15 pieces performed, appears in English, Armenian and Turkish in the striking booklet that comes with the CD.
It was a special treat to hear the complete piano works of this genius. In addition, Arzruni is such an amazing pianist - I've attended his concerts, listened to his CDs and even watched him on DVD performances - it's always moving and exciting and this proved no different. Just beautiful."
"Excellent! <SEP> An excellent Christmas album from Bruce Guthro, the frontman of the extremely successful Scottish band, Runrig.  Guthro's clear tenor brings new life to the familiar Christmas tunes, and gives us something new with the title track, Bound for Bethlehem.  Great use of traditional and celtic instruments makes for a very enjoyable listen!"
Great Relaxation <SEP> This CD is one of the best relaxation CD's I have ever enjoyed.  This CD offers techniques to unwind and breathing techniques for any time I need to destress. Amy's voice is soothing and the practice is one of the best I ever experienced. As I breath deeply I feel my self releasing tension almost immediately. I listen to it every night beofre I go to bed for a restful sleep. I think these techniques can be practiced anywhere and is a way to train yourself to instantly unwind.
"One Star <SEP> I did not order this; have no idea what it is. Take charge off my account, Please."
Cool Cool Cool <SEP> Enjoying each piece of music from this album..... You should get it if you like trailer soundtracks... I do recommend
"Something a bit different <SEP> First of all this is all instrumental. The music is lively, sometimes moody but I find it relaxing. I listen to it a lot when I go to bed, not that it's sleepy, it's just pleasant."
This is a winner! <SEP> Angie Primm is one of my favorite singers. This album didn't disappoint! I play it over and over--love the variety of songs and her distinctive arrangements.
"Maybe itll sound better in a tin can.. <SEP> It sounds better on my phone speaker rather than in my 147.4 db car system, I will stick with psyph morrison"
Do your self a favior and buy it. <SEP> Wote is a band that only comes around once in a life time. The creativity and love for music they have shines brightly through their performances. Yes most of this album and Vol. 2 are covers but their ingeniously/impeccably done.
"But, but....they did a cover of a Beatles song?? Oh yes they did :) <SEP> Normally I don't like anyone messing with Beatles music. I've always felt that some things are sacred and should be left alone. That being said, I love WOTE's version of this song. I mean I really love it. It has a sort of reggae beat to it that is so happy and infectious, I can't get enough of it. This band has so much raw talent and creativity, it is completely amazing. If the Beatles weren't, you know.......the Beatles....I think I'd like this version the best."
"Love this song! <SEP> Love this song. Love WOTE. Love Paris. This is a super catchy song, full of raw talent, good ukelele music, and amazing voices.
OHMYGOSH I LOVE THIS SONG!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love my purchase. Listen to it all the time.
"A Waste of My Money <SEP> Dismal selection of songs by mostly obscure artists. A few notable selections, this compliation pales in comparison to earlier MOS releases. For me personally, a huge  disappointment."
One Star <SEP> I'm sure someone will like this CD - not what I thought it would be
Poor. <SEP> Sad.  Highly disappointed.  It was a boring mix of easily forgettable boring tunes.  I used to enjoy purchasing these compilations each year.  Not sure ill purchase the next.
Great stuff <SEP> Has always been one of my favorites. Even more so I vinyl. Brings back a lot of memories. The quality is amazing.
"Uplifting, Feel-good  Music for Children <SEP> I downloaded this cd upon recommendation from a friend and instantly loved the track ""Radiant Child.""  The message is beautiful and the music is simple and very easy to learn and sing along with.  I played the album a few times and very quickly my 3 1/2 year old son started singing along.  I was thrilled to hear him chanting, ""I am brave, I am bold, my own spirit I do hold.""  I couldn't be more thrilled to have my children listening to empowering music aimed to center and build self-confidence while having fun."
Osobiscie zawiodlem sie. Piosenki jak Ezoteryczny Poznan czy 28 ... <SEP> Osobiscie zawiodlem sie. Piosenki jak Ezoteryczny Poznan czy 28 (one love) w wersji z tej plyty brzmia inaczej i w dodatku duzo gorzej niz orginalne. Dlatego Ci ktorzy spodziewaja sie czegos w stylu 'remastered' to zle trafili. Jest to plyta nagrana od nowa po 10 latach od wydania orginalu.
"The vocals sounds like elevator music <SEP> The vocals sounds like elevator music, but the lyrics were spot-on. Very well written..... other than the line Steve McQueen"
awesome <SEP> just love this sung bought the album then and love all the songs it thank you so much very awesome
"Effective and Efficient! <SEP> Being a lazy, busy person, tabata style workouts are becoming my new favorite because they're so efficient!  I mean, if I can't schedule out 4 minutes (plus 10 or so to get showered off and changed) out of my day, it must be a pretty ridiculous schedule.  But the songs on this album make it easy to get the timing right so you can really get the most out of your workout, in a super-efficient length of time!"
"Best meditation CD ever!! <SEP> I absolutely LOVE this meditation CD!!Shanti helped take my meditation practice to a whole new level. The soothing tones of the crystal and Tibetan singing bowls took me from a fidgety 10 minute ""quiet time"" to a deep 25 minute, truly connected meditation. The steady sounds of the singing bowls coupled with the deep tones of the gongs, spirited sounds of tuning forks and ting-sha's, culminate into this deep, rich sound that will keep you meditating long after your alarm goes off. I've found this CD is also great when I'm driving (especially in traffic) as well as for keeping my dogs calm throughout the day. I also have friends who play it while they're studying to help them focus. All and all, an amazing CD!"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great CD, Luc!"
"Good music, good lyrics <SEP> Good music , good lyrics, good chores, ,, but I would like to hear the person that wrote sing is and I was wondering how much of the .99 goes to him?????????"
"This is a bootleg <SEP> Turns out that this is a Russian bootleg that looks very good. While from a decent source recording, the sound leaves much to be desired."

"An Oasis of Peace <SEP> The speed at which the world moves is rapid and intense. We often find ourselves racing through life, pulled in seemingly a thousand directions at once. We are employees, parents, lovers, friends, and so much more  all at the same time! In what Kundalini yogis call the Aquarian Age, it can be challenging to find a way to slow down when everything around us seems so frantic. But slow down we must, because the world is now interconnected in more ways than we can imagine. The impact of our decisions carries much weight, and it is imperative that we move from a space of calm and stillness. That is where Ramdesh Kaur's Journey Into Stillness: Guided Meditations with Kundalini Mantras comes in.

Journey Into Stillness is a fantastic tool for creating stillness and peace in your life. Drawing on her wisdom and experience as a Kundalini yoga teacher, and her love of Kundalini mantras, Ramdesh Kaur created an album of guided meditations that will take you on journeys into the depths of your soul. There you will find deeper peace, healing, and love than you may have imagined possible. Each meditation was created to give the listener a profound experience of the energy and meaning of the Kundalini mantra it accompanies. Producer Ram Dass Khalsa did an amazing job balancing the meditations and the mantras, allowing each to support the other for a deep meditation experience.

The first meditation on Journey Into Stillness is Guided Meditation for Conscious Breathing. Paired with Snatam Kaur's Ong Sohung, this meditation connects you to the power of the breath, and the peace within you. Dwelling in the divine consciousness of the Universe, you will rest in a state of complete relaxation and peace. Listen to this track any time you want to connect with this state of openness and calmness. It is always available to you, as close as your breath.

In Guided Meditation for Relaxation Ramdesh's voice helps you to effortlessly relax every muscle of your body. The sounds of Mirabai Ceiba's Har Mukunday dissolves your tension and melts it away. The beautiful English lyrics accompanying the mantra give you permission to release anything holding you back from complete relaxation and peace. It is a great meditation to do after yoga practice. 9 minutes long, it's also the perfect length to practice any time you feel yourself holding stress and tension in the body. You can listen to it when preparing to sleep, to help relax your body and let go of the stresses of the day.  It is also an ideal meditation for yoga teachers to play during savasana, leading their students into a state of deep relaxation and integration of their practice.

In Guided Meditation with the Angels you will experience a sense of complete protection as you connect with angelic beings, accompanied by the sounds of Jai-Jagdeesh's Aad Guray Nameh. This meditation will leave you with the knowledge that you are never alone, that at every moment you exist in the light of divine protection. In those moments of life when anxiety and fear threaten your peace of mind, let this meditation reaffirm that nothing can harm the essence of who you really are.

The visual imagery Ramdesh creates in Meditation on the Cycle of Life is simply stunning. In this meditation you'll travel from the desert to the sea to the forest, experiencing the different environments as they cycle through the day, through the tides, and through the seasons. Mirabai Ceiba's recording of the mantra Sa Ta Na Ma is the perfect musical compliment as you connect with nature, and the timeless experience of your own soul.

Guided Meditation to the Golden Temple is perhaps the crown jewel of Journey Into Stillness. This meditation is an amazing example of the power of guided meditation to bring healing and well-being. Combining wonderful imagery with the power of the sound current, Ramdesh gently guides you to connect to the mantra Ang Sang Waheguru, and the deep healing that is available to each person. As your cells vibrate and dance with the vibration of the mantra, you will experience healing and peace on every level of your being. I can only imagine the amazing healing of heart and mind that could happen if someone were to use this meditation as a personal sadhana for 40 days or more.  The beautiful version of ""Ang Sang Waheguru"" by Snatam Kaur isn't available on any other album, making this meditation that much more special.

The final track on Journey Into Stillness is Guided Meditation for Self-Love. The beautiful instrumental track Lullaby from Ram Dass gives this meditation so much sweetness, and repeating these simple, powerful affirmations feels like bathing your heart in pure love. This should be the first thing every person says each day, and the last thing we tell ourselves before sleeping each night. How powerful it would be, how much love it would create on our planet if we could all go through our days in this space of love and forgiveness!

One of the wonderful things about Journey Into Stillness is that it truly is an album for everyone. If you're a yogi and mantra lover, this CD will be a wonderful compliment to your practice. You can use it for savasana after doing your asana practice, or choose the track that would most compliment the kriya you practiced and spend some time in deep meditation. If you've never meditated before, this is the perfect album for you. Because it's a guided meditation CD, all you have to do is press play and let Ramdesh's voice guide you. Her words evoke vivid imagery in the mind, even for people who may find visualization difficult at times. Her tone of voice brings instant relaxation and a sense of well-being.  Not only is it great for meditation, it also helps you to sleep at night.  Listen to any of the tracks as you prepare to sleep, and leave it playing through the night for a peaceful, supportive atmosphere.

Journey Into Stillness is an oasis of peace in a hectic world. The meditations and Kundalini mantras have a beautiful synergy, and they will take you on a powerful journey into yourself, into the cosmos, and into stillness."
"And now for something completely different. . . . . <SEP> The Banjo by the Massacoustics is a surprising gem.  The only word to describe this album is ""fun""!  A little bit honky-tonk, a little bit ragtime, this album proves the talented duo of Matt and Andy Thompson can write, play, and sing any kind of music.

Whether singing about a `perfect' girl in ""Unaffected"", blending beautiful harmonies in the heartfelt ""Eventually"" (my personal favorite), gassing up the DeSoto in ""Wishing You Were Here"", or singing about the joys and fears of new love in ""All Night Long"" and ""Afraid of You"", The Massacoustics will always put a smile on your face.

Kudos to the backup musicians on this album, too.  The beautiful keyboards, clarinet, and horns are perfect with Matt and Andy's guitars, drums, bass, and, of course, banjo."
Two Stars <SEP> Song starts out so well but doesn't sustain it's initial awesomeness till the end.
Awful <SEP> Really poor recording and the singer hasn't got a good grasp of technique. I have sound effects more exiting. I do like Amazon's downloading opportunities though and the service was quick and easy just very poor recording which isn't Amazon's fault.
I really did hate it. The singer does have a nice voice ... <SEP> I didn't want this version of the song. I really did hate it. The singer does have a nice voice but not on this song.
Five Stars <SEP> Kids downloaded and they love
Five Stars <SEP> I love George Straight
The stories in the songs are great. <SEP> Not something I'll listen to frequently. The stories in the songs are great.
sonic <SEP> reallly good til i realized it was 30 FREAKING SEC SEGA DA CRAP DO NOT BUY THIS ITS NOT WORTH IT
Good listening: ) Some of these songs make great ... <SEP> Good listening :) Some of these songs make great music for when I'm on the elliptical at the gym.
"Five Stars <SEP> John Serrie, his name says it all. Lush space music that is just etherial."
"Something is lacking. <SEP> I purchased this digital album after reading rave reviews about it. I disagree. I was expecting to hear something akin to the GNR sound but it sounded more like a garage band demo tape to me. I'm glad I spent my ""free"" digital dollars on this and not real money."
Five Stars <SEP> for counterfeit  cd copy
big disappointment on Christmas morning when my husband played it <SEP> I thought this was the band Firehouse from the 80's....big disappointment on Christmas morning when my husband played it.
"ordered <SEP> ordeerd on a whim. would not recommend. terrible music. mot jazz, blues, just weird and crappy. no way do i listen to this"
"A Lovely Song worth adding to my mp3 list <SEP> This girl has gotten a lot of hate from people, who rather than focusing on a critique of her music attacked the person instead. While I don't like her other songs, In Your Words stands out as a sensitive and thoughtful song with a touching message, a lovely rhythm, and a voice that doesn't hide against the music. This combination makes the song a successful ballad. Looking at this song separately from all the drama that surrounds the artist, this song stands as a good addition to the slow jams on a music list."
"Song version does not match title or sample. <SEP> After purchasing, you will wind up with the Florence Welch remix instead of the Burns remix. The file version needs to be corrected to the Burns remix to match the title and sample."
"Why? <SEP> I was curious to what this song might sound like as a remix, so I listened to some of the outtakes from different dj's and chose to purchase this one.  Once again a decent tune is ruined.  It's my opinion that the remix standards are a thing of the past, and as such people are really stretching the limits in a most horrid way in order to compensate for what 'has been'.  This remix is just that, horrid.  And, well, horribly annoying."
"short, pricey <SEP> I was in a pinch because I needed the sound immediately and didn't have time to find a similar sound, there is no way sounds that are only two seconds long should be 99 cents, Sure it's only a dollar and I could ""save"" money buy getting the entire album but I only needed the one sound..."
One Star <SEP> This song is great but the Amazon app won't play it for some reason. I'm giving the service1 star..
One Star <SEP> please stop using the tradename american alsatian  by lois denny schwarz. thank you.  Lois Denny Schwarz
Blinged Glasses <SEP> A great collaberation. The usual greatness you expect from Calvin Harris with an outstanding Preformance from Ms Florence Welch. A must Have.
"not the song I wanted <SEP> try getting the version I heard on the radio but neither of the tracks preview feature let me listen to the chorus or hook that was on the radio so I made a guess and purchase this version. Turns out it was the wrong 1, that was a waste of money."
"Thought I was ordering the Calvin Harris Version but it was all remixes <SEP> I love this song and video, but all these were remixes and not even the musical version of Calvin's. Not please with this choice. Guess I should have read the fine print. Not all of us are MP3 literate. Still doing CD's"
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! AMAZING VIDEOS AND BRILLIENT SOUND <SEP> OMG! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! AMAZING VIDEOS AND BRILLIENT SOUND!
"Good Song <SEP> Great song, used it in a presentation for my sister's wedding and she loved it. One of her favorite songs."
Awesome <SEP> One of many of Wes Morgan dynamic songs. I recommend it to the fullest. Nothing like worship in the morning.
"Not Really Explicit... <SEP> I'm a big fan of illScarlett.  This is a family friendly christmas tune... except for the Chevy Chase sample at the end (from Christmas Vacation) where Mr Chase drops the big swear word. Otherwise, easy listening and fun chirstmas tune."
"love it <SEP> can t complain, this song makes you want to turn it up and sing along at the top of your lungs"
A dancing classic <SEP> This is one of Fito's best songs of many. It's fun to listen to and great for anyone who loves Spanish dancing music.
"We Celebrate You by Wes Morgan -AWESOME SONG <SEP> This song is such a great and simple song that gives glory to the name above all names, which is Jesus.
What also makes this song great is the praise team that I sing on is singing this song.
I will be doing the lead on the song. Wes doesn't just sing but sing."
Unique <SEP> As soon as some artist hits the charts five others copy their sound.  It is difficult to find someone who is not only very talented but also has a unique sound.  Play it a few times to get used to it.  Excellent and different.
"So Entertaining! <SEP> I purchased this CD after seeing Totsy when they opened for Brian Setzer.  I had never heard them before and it was a refreshing discovery.  The lead singer has a wonderful and distinctive voice.  You are mezmorized watching her.  She and the band are a mix of cute and sexy.  Loved Them!  I like all the songs, but prefer the upbeat tunes.  Great fun!"
I have been looking to see if Nils Frahm has anything else like this but sadly I have not found anything yet <SEP> I'm going to say it; the solar system brought me here. I have been looking to see if Nils Frahm has anything else like this but sadly I have not found anything yet. Saying it sounds so good is an understatement. I looked everywhere for a lossless version but this was it.
Wagon Wheel <SEP> Because it was my nephew and his friends favorite song. He passed away in October of last year at the age of 30.
"Sound quality was poor <SEP> A good and hit song, but the sound quality was poor."
"Four Stars <SEP> Very realistic, many of us know this only too well."
One Star <SEP> I like this can music It the best for me
"Excellent song! <SEP> I previously downloaded ""Let's Groove"" from Phil; it was a very soothing and relaxing tune.  This song shows another side to Phil -- makes me wanna dance!  Excellent work; will likely download other MP3's from Phil!"
One Star <SEP> The old English song just does not take to an American jazz version.
"Arthur Prysock '74 a classic gem! <SEP> I gave this wonderful recording 5 stars because of Arthur Prysock's smooth, soulful baritone voice and beautiful orchestrations that you just don't hear in music today. Its a shame that this album isn't on CD because I would consider this recording to be one of his best. I remember my mother playing this album over and over again back in 1977 after she bought it in a record store. Also the many shows he would have at the Henry's Palace nightclub ( later Watts Club Mozambique) in Detroit back in the 70's. So many great songs. In the Rain, Don't Misunderstand, And I Love you so, Good Morning Blues, Thank Heaven for you, A day in the life of a Fool, A Man Sings the Blues, Good Morning Heartache, Colour my World, and My Sweet Lord all wonderful songs. I'm so appreciative for Amazon making this Mp3 download available for everyone so we won't miss out on this once lost treasure. A must have for the Prysock fan. I would recommend this album to anyone that is into great soulful jazz singing of the mid 70's with a nightclub type atmosphere. Those who bought the Arthur Prysock albums on vinyl back in the day knows what I'm talking about."
"Beautiful stuff <SEP> This is a fun album to listen to. Some of the songs stay close to the way you would typically hear them, while some present a more modern version of the hymn, but still remain true to the spirit of the original."
"Disappointing compared to 2009/2010 <SEP> Leave it up to Armada to rip us off, charge us more and include only radio edit versions, so sad"
"Not really a fan - too much dubstep interludes... <SEP> Maybe I am too old, but I am more a fun of older ""melodic"" trance - songs with a discernible catchy tune. On this mix, it seems even the songs I find myself liking are suddenly interrupted with an obnoxious ill-fitting dubstep burst of discordant electronics before going back to the song. I guess trying to be something for everybody but not making either camp happy..."
"Should be on Christian radio! <SEP> This album has been on repeat since I first bought it!  The songs are very catchy and have great messages, but without being too overbearing.  Currently, my favorite songs are ""The Other 167"" and ""Heavens Rejoice"", which is an honest look at when you lose someone you love.  Download it!"
wonderful new artist ! <SEP> Wonderful music. Refreshing. You can hear the lyrics clearly. Uplifting and fun.
"Love his music! <SEP> I've heard a couple of Scott's songs on the XM Margaritaville station.  When I searched for his CD, Amazon is the only place I could find it."
THANK GOD SHE IS BACK <SEP> When I saw that Carmen Electra was coming out with a new song I was thrilled. I still jam to her 1991 album with PRINCE and I have been hoping that she would come out with some new material. Well it does not dissapoint. I keep listening over and over. I really like the song and the production quality and her voice sounds great. K$SHA can now see where it originated. Thank You CARMEN.
One Star <SEP> ok
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!  Great showcase of James' voice
amazing <SEP> James is amazing his voice is pure with what he does alone and with Sixx am. People should give him the credit he deserves.
"Doesn't Disappoint! <SEP> I've been a Sixx:A.M. fan from day one, but I wasn't sure how much I would like James Michael without DJ Ashba or Nikki Sixx. This song is fantastic however! It is melodic and catchy, and just sounds great! I highly recommend"
"Amazing <SEP> I am very surprised this album has barely any information on it. Not one song is even on YouTube, not if that's a good thing or bad thing. I love the original pieces done by all the artists on here. Each song has it's own unique feel to it. This album is under rated and I only found out about by it by clicking through Spotify and just happening to find it. Buy this album or spread it around, all of these artists deserves more attention. Also none of these songs are even listed on Wikipedia with the artists credit in doing them, very strange."
"Senza ""voce"" <SEP> I purchased this CD form Amazon because of my interest in Neapolitan Songs. Senza Mamma was used in Godfather 2 as well a snipet of Lassano Napule - not on this CD - should have been. Also Pennino is Francis Ford Coppola's grandfather after whom Coppola was named.
The singer Rocco Ruggiero is a dull bass voice. Tenors and high baritones should sing these songs - not basses, I wouln't have minded if this singer was a good bass. He sounds like a rank amatuer. His Napulitan' dialect is atrocious. He should stick to chiropractoring.
I definitely will keep the CD because of the content. I'd like to know who chose this singer?"
"Easily the best EP of 09 <SEP> This is mind blowing, This is the best $6 money is going to get you right now.  There isn't one song on this album that isn't a 5/5.  Take my word, you will NOT regret this purchase."
"Lovely, harmonious singing captures true meaning of Christmas! <SEP> I'm enjoying the lovely harmonious voices of the Beane Family this Christmas Season! Just purchased the CD and am playing it in my car...Like the traditional hymn-like sound of many of the songs...reminds me of the true meaning of Christmas!! Thank you precious Beane family!!"
"Auntie Evil's Rocked My Christmas <SEP> Auntie Evil's Christmas Special made my audiences groove and laugh at the same time ... as an online DJ playing to a global audience, I'm always on the prowl for great and unusual tracks.  Sly and Reggie did an awesome job putting together this humorous and musically groovy tune!  You just have to listen once and you're hooked.  I highly recommend this track to anyone who enjoys a little something different."
Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic tune by Eric.
One Star <SEP> Great song but 10 dollars for one song sucks !
"Do not buy! Not full album, only 1 song, go to iTunes and save yourself $9. <SEP> Unbelievable that this is only 1 song. Figured for that price it was a full length CD! I totally never bother to look, so I guess it's buyer beware and my fault.  I did order this from my phone, which the phone app is poor for looking at full description. But holy crap what a rip off! I do not think I will ever purchase music from Amazon! I could have gotten this on iTunes for $0.99. Save your money, go to iTunes and buy this!!!!"
"I am the artist performing these pieces, and I ... <SEP> I am the artist performing these pieces, and I have not authorized the sale or promotion of this pirated work."
Too funny to miss! <SEP> These guys are nuts but truly genius! Buy it now for the cheapest laugh you have ever had! Well worth the .99 you will pay for it. Just makes it funnier when you know who is singing it.
"Eric is in fine voice as always <SEP> This is a stunning, albeit short set. Eric is in fine voice as always, and The Greenhornes are a tight, powerful band. ""Black Dog"", as already stated by someone else, makes the whole EP worth having. I too would love to see a full album with this lineup. This is really a pleasant surprise!"
Four Stars <SEP> Good
The story is so slow and music is boring for a 4 year old <SEP> The story is so slow and music is boring for a  4 year old. Went in the trash! I wouldn't waste my money on it.
"Wonderful! <SEP> This is a wonderful album, perfect for kids. And who better to narrate than Catherine Zeta Jones! Go Runaway Bunny!"
"Lovely Christmas Song. <SEP> Mr. Bradshaw sings with a soft, lullaby voice. The melody is simple with a transparent accompaniment. The lyrics are warmly nostalgic. Lovely song."
No way to do business <SEP> Did not download and no way to communicate easily to fix problem.i think this was a ripoff.wold not recommend to anyone
"Soothing to the soul and inspirational to the mind;  Amazing artist! <SEP> I listened to the entire album on repeat while driving down PCH (Pacific Coast Highway). It is soothing to the soul, yet inspirational to the mind. The music paired with the crashing waves of the Pacific took me on a truthful and emotional journey. Highly recommend Let's Get Married and Keep Asking Questions..."
Five Stars <SEP> The music is so beautiful. BrunuhVille has become one of my favorite artists....
"Great! <SEP> The music is mesmerizing and I would definitely get more music from this artist!  If you love Celtic music, you will enjoy this!"
Five Stars <SEP> Que est&aacute; bueno disco de electronica
"Totaly Unexpected - A Pleasant Surprise <SEP> If you are familiar with Steve Morse guitarist of (Dixie Dregs), Ian Pace drummer for (Deep Purple), Rick Wakeman keyboardist for(YES), Don Airey or Mario Fasciano you will be surprised by this music. It really shows the adversity of these great musicians. It has a smooth melodic streets of Italy feel.

Great Stuff"
Five Stars <SEP> Great music
So beautiful...... <SEP> This is my favorite song........ and the Putnam High School choir sounds GREAT !!!!! It is so refreshing to hear a high school choir sing so beautiful.
"End of a long search <SEP> Lush, expertly scored and performed arrangements of popular songs and movie themes.  I had been looking for this rendition of ""A Portrait of Jenny"" for about 40 years but had been put on the wrong track by a radio DJ who, upon inquiry back then, told me the artist was Morty Gould instead of Marty Gold.  I was very excited to stumble across it and happy to make its reacquaintance with this purchase through Amazon."
"wow <SEP> Im not some christian extremist either, but this is absolute garbage! its like poking fun at Ghandi...yea we get it -freedom of speech etc. So I guess that part is clear...outside of that, WASTE OF TIME and Sean Casey- you're an embarrassment to mankind..smh"
Outstanding! <SEP> This album is an uplifting and beautiful experience!
Inspiration <SEP> I love this song! It is inspirational and it reminds me of my time in Hawaii every time I hear it.
"Great CD, 10/10 <SEP> I got this CD as a gift and I got to say , it's incredible. I love Jeremy Sisto's Acting A lot! And his Singing is out of this world good. I hope he keeps making music! Because he's a very talented person."
I hate giving poor reviews <SEP> OK I don't like this collection of songs.  I felt like the work was phoned in.  And that really gets my goat because Mr Sisto has the chops to do much better.
"One of the best from THE best Moody Blues album- Every Good Boy.... <SEP> One of my all time favorites. Ranks  #2. This album, Every Good Boy Deserves Favor, is IMHO, The Moody Blues best  ever album."
One Star <SEP> It is a shame that such a good singer is recorded so badly this cd is unlistenable.
"what sessions? <SEP> There are 2 songs on this little 7"" record. No ""sessions"" at all. The description didn't imply this was not a full LP. Not to mention, it took almost 2 weeks to arrive."
"He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother. <SEP> Excellent Music CD, It was  number 1 hit in the UK, originally it was a fund raiser for the  family's of 96 Liverpool FC fans who died in a tragic stadium accident.  After 20 years the original court decision was reversed and the family's will get compensation from the British Government."
"Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful, soulful."
One Star <SEP> Wrong selection
I am moved deeply every time I hear it as ... <SEP> I am moved deeply every time I hear it as I remember it was the background music to Sullivan Ballou's letter to his wife Sarah.
Beautiful tribute to the Hillsborough victims <SEP> The stars who lined up to make this single and the wonderful remake of a classic song makes this tune a must have in your collection. It's going to make a classic another memorable treasure.
"A good tune for a good cause <SEP> This all-star recording is very faithful to the Hollies' hit, with some fresh touches - like Paul McCartney's hot guitar solo. Highly recommended musically, and proceeds go to a fund for the families of the Hillsborough disaster."
Wow <SEP> Really catchy song.  Who are these guys?
Avoid this re-release. No stereo...or duophonic <SEP> Both discs are in mono. Avoid this re-release.
The cover of this 2 Cd is a lie. ... <SEP> The cover of this 2 Cd is a lie. THERE IS NOT STEREO RECORDING.When you read the booklet it says false/fake stereo. AVOID!!!
"Not True Stereo...?  Not even Duophonic !  (2 mono CD's !) <SEP> What a letdown and ripoff, not to mention an incredible screw-up...
Advertised and labelled as the mono and stereo versions,
and admitted to being the mono and duophonic versions in the liner notes,
the actual discs hold 2 slightly different sounding masters of the album in MONO.
The 2nd disc, which is supposed to be the Capitol Duophonic (Fake Stereo) version of the album
is actually also in pure mono, just like disc 1.
I own the duophonic vinyl album, and as most fans know,
there is a noticeable difference in sound,
and definite R/L channel seperation using EQ and/or out of sync phasing,
depending on what year the mix was made by Capitol angineers.
There is no Stereo master of this album, which is why Capitol did not include it
in the excellent 2012 ""mono & stereo"" reissues of the Beach Boys catalog.
Looked like this would bring fans the unique duophonic version of the debut album,
but nope - they blew it. Avoid this one completely."
"Not True Stereo <SEP> I thought that this would be a remix of the original tapes to produce a true stereo version of these recordings. It is not, In fact the liner notes admit as much. No point in getting this if you bought the Capitol release of this album  in the 1990's.
I wasted my money buying this.

However, if you've never owned this album and you are a true fan that must have all the albums  then its a fine addition to your any Beach Boy collection. It's their first release and music wise is not as great an album as later releases. For any true fan though it is essential as a benchmark to chart their growth as a group."
It is much better than this one <SEP> I have another recording from the same author on Audible but that one won't play continuously. It is much better than this one.
Awful!! <SEP> Terrible! Both albums arrived broken!!
"Great Song <SEP> I connect with this song.  I knew the people it was written about.  Its a very heart felt honest song.  Well written and well performed, just like all of Billy's music."
One Star <SEP> This is the worst thing ever made.
"New cover, same WRONG SONGS. <SEP> Link Wray deserves better than this. I'm giving it ONE STAR because Amazon won't let me leave ZERO.

A new Link Wray record?  Nope.  It has a fancy cover though.

See reviews of these other mp3 Link Wray records.  This music has all been released before, but this one does it with a twist...

Like the other Link Wray mp3 downloads, instead of correctly listing the song titles, they actually CHANGE the song names! The alternate take of ""Commanche"" becomes ""Commanche Two"".  The alternate take of ""Lillian"" becomes ""Lillian My Sun"".  An honest mistake or an attempt to get someone to download a ""new"" unreleased Link song? Draw your own conclusion.

A cheap attempt to make a few bucks off Links' name. He deserves better than this effort.

Put your hard earned money to better use. Go to the original source. Pick up the far superior Link Wray ""Slinky!"" CD set on Sundazed."
"Absolute puke <SEP> Believe me, it's not what you're expecting. Don't waste your money on this pile of puke. Thankfully I didn't purchase this on physical media or I'd be even more upset"
"this was awesome <SEP> This music was amazing on so many levels-  the artistry was phenominal,  the point made was profound (and yes,  there was really deep thinking behind this music,  actually)  the connection with our history was so poiniant it brought tears to my eyes.  very rarely have i heard music so well done."
Its my Sly song of the summer winter 1994 :)was played <SEP> Its okay-Its okay-That might cause bad humor-Its okay-that's what I have to search always for I mean watch on it. But Known Techno is Techno
One Of My Favorites <SEP> I have always loved this song. This rendition is beautifully composed. I could listen to it over and over. A truly lovely tune.
Four Stars <SEP> I teally enjoy this album.
.. <SEP> Good.
One Star <SEP> Not what i was looking for - realized that NOTHING from Prince is available as a download :(
"Fantastic! <SEP> This is incredibly enlightening, entertaining and fun. Terrie is the consummate entertainer. Anything that she writes, produces, directs or acts in is always top notch and first class. This is the ultimate in fun and entertainment. Don't miss out on this wonderful production!"
A+ <SEP> great song
Good Product <SEP> Good and relaxing.  I have noticed a difference in my self defense tactics.  Recommended for anyone who wants to experiment with mind power.
"this is a very beautiful indie pop record with great childlike songs juxtaposed with ... <SEP> Clever without being cloying, charming and challenging at once, literate and playful, up/down... how many dialectics do you want here?  this is a very beautiful indie pop record with great childlike songs juxtaposed with heavy sentiments and guitars guitars guitars.  do you think Nada Surf are sometimes just a bit too sugary?  do you think Fountains of Wayne were over-rated and inferior to IVY?  that the Posies first, acoustic CASSETTE (""Failure"") was their peak moment?  do you think you'd like this?  you WOULD. buy it on vinyl if you can.  so smile-inducing.  and I do mean Brian Wilsonish too.  xox for this record.  better singers than the Big Star they're often compared to, this World Record record's a dream.  did I say buy it.  just wow so good."
Beautiful Version of this song!!! <SEP> I love this rendition of this beautiful song.
"Great songs <SEP> Great recording studio stuff.  Fun to hear Elvis working on his well known songs, talking between takes with the musicians and others in the room."
One Star <SEP> Was trying to order Psycho Bass by Jessy J. and got this.  Not my cup of tea.  Sorry
Two Stars <SEP> Not What I Thought It Would Be!!!
Gypsy is funky but mellow. <SEP> Hear this track online and really enjoyed it; so I went ahead and downloaded it. If you like Jazz give it a listen.
Awesome collection <SEP> Great songs. I just wish the actual songs were longer! I can't wait for the full releases. Glad I bought this.
Two Stars <SEP> never did get it.
Killer Tone <SEP> This is a great version of this classic tune; different than the Stray Cats version. Filled with all of the tasteful licks we love from B.S.
Five Stars <SEP> That was dazzling!
"Sleepwalk <SEP> Its amazing what artists do when they have problems sleeping. Great music to listen to, my girlfriend likes listening to it too."
"words to live by <SEP> self love is a amazing meditation and is part of my routine, Sandra has a a voice of a angel-"
Five Stars <SEP> Great guitar work
"Nothing to grab you <SEP> Sorry there's just nothing to grab you in this track. Nothing stands out in the music, lyrics, or the vocals. This one won't make it onto any of my playlists."
"worst song ever <SEP> this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks."
"Pure Rocker <SEP> Gary Hoey is a pure guitarist, plain and simple.  He rocks out and you can just tell from his playing that this is what he loves.  Like so many other musicians, he gets lost in the crowd.  It's a real shame."
"Great texture and sounds <SEP> A lot of great electronic stuff coming out of Alpha Pup lately...well, out of the west coast in general. The samples are pretty accurate in portraying the sound. This album sounds somewhat like chiptune, but a bit denser and not obnoxious. Simple song structures with many cool sounds--all working together to build a sort of sinister, dark atmosphere. My favorite tracks are Handle the Ill and Airliners Patio. However, I recommend the EP in its entirety."
I better get my money back <SEP> It never dowloaded!! I better get my money back!
Dying ducks ahoy! <SEP> Wow. That is one screwy piece of Sonic music. The lowbrow tone of Oil Desert Act 1 becomes topped with utter annoyance. The duck sounds that the song makes are irritating!
"Thank god this wasn't on consoles <SEP> This freaking song is the perfect representation of the entire level. This song comes from a solely pinball-based level that can be beaten by repeatedly bouncing Sonic into the slot machine, and the process is absolutely tedious. THIS FRIGGIN SONG complements it in the most fitting way. It feels like absolute torture as it plays during the tediousness.

So why is this song pure torture? It's a clownish tune that plays for practically SECONDS before it loops again, making an already annoying composition awful!"
"Almost Perfect... Bad Pun <SEP> White vinyl was a nice touch. Sound quality was good. This is just one of those alblums it's hard to listen to just a few songs, it really is good from start to finish. The almost continue to refine their sound and talent, and I can't help but love the message and the heart of the music"
Two Stars <SEP> Not as good as I was hoping for unfortunately.
"the entire album rocked, moved, stirred deeply <SEP> rockin, moving. They busted it out - melody still intact. hard to find that depth and power all with a kickin sound."
"good music <SEP> I love the gospel songs that Sam Cooke sang; go when I can get to download a song by Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, I am all for that"
"Great retro sensation <SEP> There are so many styles that can be heard in each of these songs, a combination of sounds of the 60's and 70's. From super mellow to the high energy blues of Naugahyde. This is a CD one would put on when the idea is to let you thoughts take a break and your body to relax. It is somewhat primitive in it's structure not many breaks and very few methodical endings, still it doesn't suck and that's a fact."
Unreal <SEP> Great for Starting a Mararothon !!!!!!! =  ) Its really pumping It will make you feel like a cloud and flying like the wind when running !!!!!
Perfect Song <SEP> This is probably the best W&W track since Invasion. It's definitely a must have! I normally don't write reviews on anything but this is an exception :)
Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar CIRCUS <SEP> There's a reason why this track was not used in Sonic 3D Blast: It's most likely because of how CLOWNISH it really sounds. So much for a threatening vibe from one of the harsher video game villains out there.
"Amazing <SEP> It's actually better than the ""original"" song by will.i.am."
"Need to Play 2 discs at the same time! <SEP> I had no idea when I ordered this that 2 discs need to be played At The Same Time. Plus, there are 3 discs, so which two? Totally confusing so I have only listened to one disc and I was not impressed."
Great song but wait till it's fixed! 5 stars after its fixed. <SEP> This song comes with ... silence at the end. If you buy it from Amazon see how long your song will be. The actual song lasts about 7 1/2 minutes. If yours like mine is longer than you will have an extra 8 minutes of silence after your song ends.
"Misleading! <SEP> The remix is not 19:53 long.. it is the standard 7 minute Tiesto Remix of the song which is great.. but there is some silence after and then what appears to be a hidden track.. I think it is called ""What If""... it is very acoustic and slow... From the appearance of the page to buy this track, it is as if it's a 20 minute long remix.  I know there is a very long Tiesto mix out there and I thought that is what this was.  It is not... so be aware before you get too excited over this..."
NOT DUSTY SPRINGFIELD!!!! <SEP> Not dusty Springfield!!!
"Don't be deceived <SEP> This is a bad imitation of someone who thinks they sound like Dusty Springfield, but does not. If you like the song, get the original version sung by Dusty."
Loves Redd Loves Blue <SEP> Good music - melodies stick in your head. Lyrics are interesting - eminently worth listening to by most under 70.
"Love Exene and DJ...  but this album is forgettable. <SEP> The idea that I would be giving a weak review to a product made by any of the members of X - let alone two of them: Exene Cervenka and DJ Bonebreak - breaks my heart.  However, this album, originally released in the 1990's, is just not very strong.  The lack of John Doe's voice, literally and figuratively, undercuts the likable and familiar contributions of Exene and DJ.  And, of course, few could step into the lead guitar shoes of Billy Zoom, Dave Alvin, or Tony Gilkyson.  Buy Exene's poetry.  Buy DJ Bonebreak's ""Syncopaters"" work.  Buy the Knitters and, of course, X.  But skip this."
"Great Song <SEP> Fantastic songs and fantastic lyrics , Piyush Mishra proves he is a genius ,  This is totally worth the money spent ."
"This is just an awesome rock and roll jam <SEP> This is just an awesome rock and roll jam. I consider Krokus a post-British New Wave of Heavy Metal band and probably more akin to the timeline of the American New Wave of Heavy Metal, and making their mark around the same time as bands like Motley Crue, Ratt, Quiet Riot, etc. IMHO they created a masterpiece with Headhunter."
Great song! <SEP> Great upbeat song about women not taking any s***! I loved this song from the first time I heard it on the show!
"Perfect Song <SEP> Sweet, great harmonies, better story, everything a song should be, more more more of Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio and Nashville"
"Beautiful song - love both versions <SEP> I love listening to them sing together.
This song is beautifully written and sung by both the original (Striking Matches) and on the show."
Five Stars <SEP> good music check it out!
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
Two Stars <SEP> Not such a great son
"I love this song I plan on playing at my wedding day <SEP> I love this song I plan on playing at my wedding Jan. 14 2017. I'm a 65 year old widow and my man is a 67 year old widower, It is perfect. I really hope this show stays on the air I have Hulu and have watched twice, just love the show."
"Wonderful <SEP> This is a wonderful love song!  It is heart warming, soft and romantic without all the teeny bopper hipe of a lot of love songs these days."
Two Stars <SEP> I LOVE AKON BUT PREFER THE CLEAN VERSION I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD ONE FOR THIS SONG
Two Stars <SEP> not their best son...
Five Stars <SEP> Great Christmas tune- a little rock and a little r&b!  It's really fun.
"Beautiful song. <SEP> Christmas music that stirs the soul, and my memories of growing up. Beautiful song."
One Star <SEP> I'll wiz on your shoe bitch!
Good music <SEP> Marvelous charming singer
"DISAPPOINTING. <SEP> I WAS JUST PLAIN DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT THAT WITH THAT GREAT CHOICE OF SONGS, THAT IT WOULD BE AWESOME. I FELT AS THOUGH SOME OF THE SONGS WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE. THE SOUND QUALITY WAS BELOW PAR ALSO. I RECOMMEND HER NEW ALBUM."
"This is a beautiful song by two of the most beautifully unique voices ... <SEP> This is a beautiful song by two of the most beautifully unique voices I have heard in a long time.  Like Lee De Wyze singing Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", this is a cut that I can listen to for hours.  It is haunting.  It is melodic.  It is beautiful. It is transendic.  it is something that anyone ever in love with the wrong person has felt, but been unable to express."
"This is terrible <SEP> I am partially to blame. I got so excited about this song, I didn't listen to the preview. Imagine my surprise when I got some second stringer doing a bad imitation of the real deal. I am a little shocked that Amazon put out such a poor product, but buyer be ware."
"Too short <SEP> It was too short and I did not fall asleep even after listening to the recording twice. It has a nice cadence, just needs to add some more depth."
not worth getting <SEP> Nice voice and okay music.  CD too short and hypnosis was ineffective.  A waste of money.
"Five Stars <SEP> Great song, talented orquesta."
Downloaded by mistake... <SEP> I was looking for a version closer to the original to help me learn the guitar part...
Five Stars <SEP> Lovely performance and music
great song <SEP> Love this song it has a nice modern swing jazz feel to it. I also bought the Call the Dudes of Swing.
Deceiving <SEP> Some artists sound like the original.  Others aren't even close.  I'd rather have gotten the original artists.
"Super geil! <SEP> Amazingly enough, I had never heard the German version until I discovered it recently on YouTube! I feel like I've uncovered a gem that went unnoticed. :-)"
One Star <SEP> Didn't realize it's not the original artists
FAKE Dont buy <SEP> These are not the real songs.  These are a group that just sings the 80's songs.  I think there may possibly be a legal issue as well since on at least some of the songs it sounds like they are using a band instrumental...wonder if they paid to use it.
"AWFUL!!!! <SEP> Badly Re-Mastered -- 80s fan and this is not 80s style music.  Sounds NOTHING like the originals!!!!

DO NOT BUY!!!"
"I should have bought the individual songs that I like <SEP> I found two songs that I like, out of 100, and I'm guessing I will find 2 or 3 more that I like.  So I would have saved $14 by just buying the individual songs that I like."
"Not the original <SEP> I get frustrated with how the less common version of a song somehow is at the top of the amazon list when I go to buy via my smart phone.  This has happened to me more than once and it is annoying.

My fault for not previewing the song, although I would expect the most popular and common version to be at the top not some random version hardly anyone buys."
"Don't buy this.. Zero Stars. It's not ... <SEP> Don't buy this..
Zero Stars.
It's not the version from the moviePerformed by ""Movie Sounds Unlimited""
Amazon, please pull this off your shelf or change the way its marketed.
The small print is too small to read."
Not the original version <SEP> This one is not the original. Falls short.
"one of my favorite song from the 80's <SEP> this is one of my favorite song from the 80's, I hope we can still buy song likes this for less than a dollar"
RIP OFF!!! <SEP> FAKE!!!!  NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!  STAY AWAY!!! RIP OFF!!!!
Great Song <SEP> Great song
"Great album from Savant. <SEP> If you are a fan of dubstep-like wub and techno-like beats paired with 8-bit synths, this album is for you.  I have been enjoying this album over and over again since I bought it."
"tune <SEP> this tune is simply amazing and easygoing to hear.  I love listening to it before going to bed, fall sound asleep peacefully."
"Solar Fields, Aes Dana...and not much else to recommend it. <SEP> When I saw this had two of my favorite artists on Ultimae Records, Aes Dana and Solar Fields, I thought I should definitely check it out.  Turns out those are the only two good tracks, period.  They are the last two.  The rest is cliched techno with too many cheesy vocal samples and beats that are too up front for ambient fans and too mellow for techno fans.  Granted, compilations can be uneven, but usually they at least strive for a cohesive identity, which is lacking here.  Pass."
Ok <SEP> I expected a little more variation from the organist. All the chords and arrangements were the same. The music was being repeated in a round robin effect. It went on and on and never really made any changes.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome CD. I am looking forward to hearing more from him.  Great praise and worship experience.
"One of the most unique guitar albums I've heard in years <SEP> This album is amazing! A combination of emotional guitar playing with clean technical precision, great tone and progressive compositions (and not in the overdone Dream Theater sounding kind-of-way, but more of the prior progressive styles of the 70's and 80's). This album is pretty unique. Haven't heard anything similar to it yet, give it a listen!"
I got played. <SEP> I should have sampled the entire CD.  After the first two songs the CD was a let down.  I thought it was smooth jazz and it went somewhere else.
"Intolerant of the traditional Christian Christmas <SEP> I bought this album shortly after it was released. Had never heard of them before, but great musicianship, the guys are good singers, the songs sound pretty good, a wide variety of musical styles, and some of the lyrics were funny. For a couple weeks I thought the album was really good, but then suddenly burned out on it. I wrote a review in January 2013 but deleted it because I wanted to listen to it again given that my impression of the album had changed so drastically.

Updated September 2016: Guess I just don't care for it like I did that first week or two.  Its the perspective and attitude the performers have about Christmas. This is really not a ""Christmas"" album. Not in either a secular or a traditional Christian sense. Jesus, whose birth has been the basis for celebration of Christmas for 2000 years now (Christ  mas, get it?)  is completely absent from every song, except for a few passing, dismissive references. OK, all Christmas music doesn't have to be about the nativity. There is certainly nothing wrong with secular Christmas or winter solstice type music, and I like ""Rudolph"" and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" just fine. There's no negative, mocking attitude toward Christmas in songs like those.

But the perspective here toward Christmas is different. It's all summed up in the words to ""Christmas With You Is the Best"": ""Let's have a nontraditional, nondenominational celebration"" and ""skip"" Christmas. Everything here is a rejection and a mockery of a traditional Christmas, both the seasonal elements and the Christian basis for the Christmas holiday through the centuries.

John Roderick wrote in the liner notes, ""The whole idea of Christmas is based on a pretty flimsy premise, after all!""  Oh, really. That is HIS narrow-minded perspective on Christmas as a religious holiday.

Im not going to apologize for being a Christian and remembering the birth of Christ on Christmas. So despite the catchy music and all, ultimately the album has no appeal to me due to what the duo composed as lyrics. After too much repeated joking and mocking of the traditional Christmas based on religious foundations, it's not funny anymore.

And why compose, record and put out a ""Christmas"" album if YOU have that perspective and don't want to celebrate Christmas? Only one song, ""Christmas is Wunnerful"", could maybe be considered as something other than another ""stick in your eye"", but even that's debatable. The simple phrase which is repeated over and over for the several minutes of the song is a really lame attempt to competently write lyrics. The duo must have completely run out of creative energy by the time this was composed. Instead of the week they say they set aside to compose and record an entire album, they should have taken a little more time to work on it.

""Wikipedia Chanukah"" doesn't even have any original lyrics. There probably are a few people who for some reason like to listen to someone else reading Wikipedia entries (?), with dance beat music in the background (?), but the novelty wears off pretty fast and even if you can bear to pay attention to this once through, it quickly becomes unlistenable. This is a verbatim recitation and does not take a hit at celebrating Chanukah, while most of the other lyrics take hit after hit at Christmas. And what's a recording about ""Chanukah"" doing in the middle of what's supposedly a ""Christmas"" album?

The continuous mocking content about celebrating a traditional Christmas ruins this album. The duo should have spent some time considering diversity, and been more respectful and less intolerant of Christian Christmas beliefs and traditions in their approach and lyrics.

Fans of the duo will get in line to mark this review ""not helpful"", which is just fine. It's too bad one dissenting opinion about this CD cannot be tolerated by the duo's entourage, despite the compliments I made about the duo's talents in the first paragraph of my review..

For those who celebrate Christmas based on religious foundations, don't make the mistake of buying this fake ""Christmas"" album like I did when it popped up as a ""recommendation"" on amazon, it's a waste of your money that supports a disrespectful and intolerant attitude about the traditional Christmas."
Love this performance! <SEP> This great Christmas traditional Victorian music fills the bill and some stockings too-have been looking for this style of music for Christmas-makes whole season bright!
"Not Just Your Same Old ""1st Time Together"" Gig <SEP> Three masters of their tools & genre play together in a very balanced way-just a wee bit too much Grisman..."
MOS have had better reases in past <SEP> Not what I was expecting. ...
Horrible <SEP> The music was good but the woman who was singing was cringe worthy horrible.  She was off key and did not have the range of Adele
"Awesome singer! Great performer! <SEP> Son Dambi is so underrated, she's my top favorite KPOP singer!
She's a very good performer and a very good singer,
and very attractive too!
If you ever catch her shows you can search her on youtube."
One Star <SEP> I was unable to download the track. I was still charged for it. I will not use amazon again
"Very poor sound quality <SEP> The sound quality is very poor. The second movement is unlistenable,and overall this recording is flat and muddled. I would avoid this,even for the bargain price. Sometimes you do get what you pay for."
Great collaboration with Pusha T! <SEP> I only wish I knew this album was released in 2012!
"Another awesome song from Erick! <SEP> No surprise...  Everything Erick sings becomes a personal favorite of mine!  I can't wait for a whole Christmas album, Erick!"
"Wow!! No review for this song yet? <SEP> Gotta give Black Dada his props for this song. It's one of the most popular songs in Miami aka ""zoe city"""
"Very cool western-themed surf-instrumental tune <SEP> As the title says!  Makes me think of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."
Addictive <SEP> The beat and uplifting lyrics are addictive and truly give me energy. I've caught myself jamming this song on repeat on many days. Glad I bought this!
Dissappointing <SEP> Only gave it 2 stars because of the background beats; other than that too much talking to the crowd to wave their hands and shout
"Opened the door to a whole different world of music with a twist <SEP> I saw On the Road and I LOVED the music.  I thought it represented a phase of early, upbeat jazz that I was unfamiliar with but really liked a lot.  Ironically I found out that the early jazz that I thought I loved on the album was actually modern compositions by Gustavo Santaolalla, a modern soundtrack guy who can't even read music supposedly!  Great album for parties."
"Amazing Soundtrack! <SEP> Really awesome music from the early 50s, great jazz, wonderful original score.  The reading by Jack Kerouac is haunting.  I highly recommend this!!"
"I was very disappointed in this album <SEP> I was very disappointed in this album. While there are some pretty arrangements, I have chosen not to listen to all of the songs because many of the songs I have listened to are overrun with static. Definitely a waste of my hard-earned money."
"You will not hear any of the great lines from JFK speeches <SEP> This CD is a complete rip-off and Amazon should pull it from their inventory.  These are not the complete speeches, not even close.  They are very small portions of the speeches that end after a minute or so, or sometimes even sooner, into the speech.  You will not hear any of the great lines from JFK speeches.  For example, you might hear someone introducing JFK, and then he starts speaking, but the speech ends before it really begins.  A huge disappointment."
"a journey to old days, and good music <SEP> One of the best albuns in the 60s, it has a wonderful version of TONIGHT, from West Side Story, plus ""Exodus"", that marvelous theme
by Ernest Gold, from the movie EXODUS (directed by Otto Preminger, in 1960), ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and other great tunes by
RICHARD RODGERS. Now it is available in CD (I have my copy). Just 12 tracks...but all of them....great music,"
Amazingggggg <SEP> Loveeeeeeeeee itttt. Favorite songgg everrrrrrrrr .. its on repeat ever single day.... I listen to ittt all the timeeeee !!!!!!!!
"Bandabandabandanaland <SEP> I think it looks good in the picture. I hope whomever has it can tell me if it matches it. Im sure it is a cotton or poly cotton blend, but I would have to use my sense of touch to find out. Im sure its flat and in the shape of a square, but thats my speculation at this point as I've only seen it in a picture. Maybe I bought the picture and im supposed to get it printed on my own fabric. Im thinking corduroy, because thats my favorite color. Yes. So ill get kinkos to print it on transfer paper and go to Michaels to get the material to print it on. And now I know, and thats half the battle. BY THE WAY SELLER. WHERE IS IT?"
Fantastic 4 <SEP> Yea ...All around tight track. hot lines. road the beat hard. This tracks been hot ever since it came out...
"Incredible! <SEP> These guys are Extremely talented.
They have great Vocals. They are truly the best of the best.
God bless them."
Five Stars <SEP> Classic!
Smashing Pumpkins <SEP> Gen X music at it's best!
not what i was looking for at all <SEP> looking for another song and this one downloaded. it is very explicit and gross. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. They should have a preview before so you can see what song it is.
"Though a couple of catchy melodies throughout may render some level of enjoyment, it is ultimately unmemorable and unworthy of S <SEP> I'm a huge fan of Seabear, but this effort is shallow and uninspired. Though a couple of catchy melodies throughout may render some level of enjoyment, it is ultimately unmemorable and unworthy of Sin Fang's usual masterfulness, especially the gorgeous warm folky sounds of his earlier works."
"Great album for both kids AND adults! <SEP> When I picked up the Silly Dilly CD for my two kids, I thought it would be filled with goofy sounds and nonsensical lyrics.  Boy, was I wrong.  Actually, it you just replaced the kid-centric lyrics with some other theme, you'd have yourself a pretty melodic, upbeat pop album.  Though the music itself (especially some of the great guitar solos) would definitely appeal to most adults, kids will find it easy to relate to. My kids (and me and my wife too!) are constantly singing the tunes, even when its not on the stereo!  The Silly Dilly band is not merely a ""kid's band"" but really a ""family band"" that mom and dad will enjoy as well.

The CD starts out with ""Come Out and Play"" which is a great opening track with a killer hook that will have you and your kids humming over and over again. However, it is the next song, ""The Happy Train,"" which really kicks off the CD with its locomotive sounds that will sure to get the little ones bobbing up and down. The third song is a beautifully fresh redention of the old classic ""Oh Suzanna.""

Mid-way through the disk we have the ""Robot Song"" where, despite a few synthesizer sounds, is more melodic than robotic. With ""Tummy Ache Blues"" you get what you expect... a fun blues with some great, mature guitar work.  ""Wazn't Me"" has a cute concept, but I'm not sure if most kids would like the minor key structure of the piece.  However, the next couple of songs get back to the smooth, fresh, sing-a-long style of the album. Towards the end we have ""Time for Dreamland,"" a beautiful lullaby that would sure to be a hit with parents looking to put the little ones down.

Overall, a great effort...great melodies, smooth, pretty harmonies, and a tight production. Highly recommended for both kids and adults."
"Not very good at all. <SEP> To associate these wonderful whiskies, the creation of which requires such love, dedication and the graceful action of time with death metal is nothing short of obscene. Nothing about these songs is evocative of the whiskies or the environment and seems nothing more than a shallow attempt to combine an inferior and strident artistic effort with distilleries who's product is both transcendental and sublime."
Yup <SEP> TFK always rocks but this is TFK on steroids.  Just because of this album/song I would consider getting a bigger sound system so I can rock out even harder and become deaf in the process.
"A pleasure to listen to! <SEP> What a great CD! Very listenable, nice variety of tunes and moods. These young musicians play with sensitivity and depth. It puts me in a good mood!"
Awesome! <SEP> The first 3 songs are the best.  The is going to be a CD version of this now.  Wish I had know that before hand.
"These are stolen, pure and simple. Don't buy. <SEP> Who is the jackass that stole this music from Incompetech.com and posted it for sale? What attorney general do we contact to fine this thief hard as a lesson to others who try to pass off someone else's work as theirs to sell?"
"do not buy, please <SEP> You can download this piece for free at my site, incompetech. I'm not sure who posted this music for sale here - but it wasn't me. Please do not support this person.

- Kevin MacLeod"
"A cheap effort to make a few bucks off the Linkster's work <SEP> Link Wray deserves better than this. I'm giving it ONE STAR because Amazon won't let me leave ZERO.

A shameless effort to make a few bucks off Link's name.  If you think this is a new Link Wray record, it ain't.

See reviews of these other mp3 Link Wray records. This music has all been released before.  And, like many of the other crop of recent Link Wray mp3 records, this one does it with a twist...

Instead of correct song titles, with this Link Wray mp3 record (and ""Young Love"", ""Moonlight Walk"", Starshine Talk"" - or whatever name the next crop of these releases will go by...) they actually CHANGE the song names! The alternate take of ""Commanche"" becomes ""Commanche Two"". The alternate take of ""Lillian"" becomes ""Lillian My Sun"".

An honest mistake or an attempt to get someone to download a ""new"" unreleased Link song? Draw your own conclusion.

A cheap attempt to make a few bucks off Links' name. He deserves better than this effort.  Amazon needs better quality control.

Put your hard earned money to better use. Go to the original source. Pick up the far superior Link Wray ""Slinky!"" CD set on Sundazed.  You even get liner notes, and credit to the photographer and songwriters.  Imagine that."
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
One Star <SEP> ok
Two Stars <SEP> Wasn't the artist singing the song.
One Star <SEP> I did not buy this.  So I there must be a mistake somewhere.
Great music <SEP> Great songs. Very soothing.
ok <SEP> I just got it because it was the only one there and I wanted to see what the music would sound like on my kindle.
"Super CD <SEP> This is a great album. The music flows well and is interesting. I love their style; in this CD and their last, each song has its own flavor. I'd highly recommend this CD for those who like funk, rock, strong instruments, Latin, or just something new and different."
True R&B. <SEP> Nice classic bedroom song.
Great voice and a catchy song! <SEP> I heard Nikki's voice on an episode of Californication and found her on Amazon.
Uh Huh Her <SEP> For me they are something special. I love their creative music. Their voices meld together in real style. You can't miss with these two. Enjoy
"Souvenirs blew my mind <SEP> Very rarely do you buy a CD that every single track is a favorite.  This is a CD that i don't have to ever use my skip button on.  What a way to be drawn into the traumatic parts of the writers life, and then brought back up with the happiness and content.  This is the only CD that i need to have anywhere.  At this point its on my Ipod, in my truck, in the stereo in my room, on my computer.  Honestly the best Rock I have heard in a very very long time.  It has a life of its own and takes from no one else (for the vocalist)especially the goo goo dolls.  I am on the edge of my seat to see what comes next."
Soothing traditional Christmas music <SEP> Beautiful Christmas instrumentals for any denomination or faith.  Will be sharing with friends and family for years to come. A great addition for my collection.
Great song. <SEP> Heard the song on a youtube video and had to know what it was. It is haunting and beautiful and I'm glad I picked it up.
"one of the world's finest orchestras, in modern sound under well known conductors ... <SEP> A real bargain...the Royal Concertgebouw , one of the world's finest orchestras, in modern sound under well known conductors (less modern in the 1950s performances by Eduard van Beinum.)  The only complaint is the that the last three movements of The Planets are not included but this can be rectified by separate purchase for $0.99 each. Otherwise, a certified hit parade of everyone's favorites."
Five Stars <SEP> doPe
Two Stars <SEP> Nowhere near the UGA Dixie Redcoat Marching Band quality.
Too bad these two didn't do more recording together <SEP> Been looking for this a long time. Too bad these two didn't do more recording together.
"FRAUD! RIP-OFF! <SEP> This is a cdr, not a real cd from the band King Lizard. The sound is really crappy lo-fi. The only place it Says King Lizzard is on the fron't cover of the booklet. The rest of the packaging including the cdr itself, the booklet and the back of the cdr case have printing and artwork for some terrible death metal band called NECROPHAGIA. I looked up this band to see if it was a real thing and sadly, it is. NECROPHAGIA means ""the need to eat dead bodies"". Nice, huh? Some of the song titles are filth and I don't want that crap in my house.

Don't buy this or anything from this seller. Garbage quality at best."
"Fantastic song! <SEP> Love this music so much,  I learned the language!"
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
Flabby and hollow <SEP> I could not get into the music on this album for the life of me. I listen to a huge variety of music and usually find something of value on each album. This sounded like people trying to sound like amazing musicians but they missed the mark. This album is a compilation of those failures.
"Five Stars <SEP> Love this song, nice creative and skillful use of auto-tuner too-which is rare."
"Great, catchy song! <SEP> Huge fan of Awkwafina, and love the song.  Sadly, it's the only one of her tracks available on Amazon MP3, but I'll be sure to get the rest as soon as they're up!"
One Star <SEP> Not interest and very boring
Headache <SEP> Maybe it is unique just for me but this subliminal with the brain wave technology it uses seems to cause me to have a headache
"Great song, Destiny, and how cool is the cover? <SEP> Great song, Destiny."
a beatle plays the blues <SEP> a beatle plays the blues. great blues from paul and steve miller man i love this song 100% blues
Five Stars <SEP> Just as I remembered.
Great love song .... <SEP> Good music . Great voice . Recommend to any wanting to listen to culture / lovers rock jams . Would listen to him any time
"A surf sound with a modern, no-nonsense attitude. <SEP> The Waterboarders are a three piece guitar, drums and bass band playing authentic surf instrumentals from way back when your mom was a beach babe.  They also infuse some modern touches (that still retain that good-ol sound).  The musicianship is gloriously rudimentary and the recording defiantly lo-fi - which is, of course, a bonus with this kind of garage groove - with echoes of The Cramps at their gnarliest (minus the sleazoid vocals). All told, a loving and loyal rendition of an era that time forgot.  ""The Waterboarders ply their surf ditties with joyful abandon -Racket from The Pit.  These guys are a fine and lively surf instrumental trio with a vintage sound."
Buy it <SEP> SMD from Sacramento turned me on to this.  Bassheads must purchase this.  Well mixed with talented lyricist.
Straight bull poo. <SEP> Terrible. Isn't original artists. That should be on the label because nobody wants to hear these lame covers.
Very Very Very low Bass! <SEP> Very Very Very low Bass! Most tracks are slow and low. Could really destroy your subwoofer with this CD! Good stuff!
"It's not spiritual <SEP> I don't agree with the previuos reviewer. This album is not spiritual.  The tribal chants are annoying and they drown out the music at times.  Flutes are nice but you can barely hear them.  My friend had recommended this to me but it is a waste of money IMO. I don't recommend this, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Visions/dp/B000QR0E5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Visions</a>&nbsp;instead!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"Not worth even being free! <SEP> I realize that free isn't always the best way to go, but this time i'm glad i DIDN'T have to pay for this!!!  NOT my kind of music for sure!!
For others, this album may be fine...but for my age range (almost 50 yrs old) it just wasn't what held MY interest!!"
"Ok, now this is the second album of reiki ... <SEP> Ok, now this is the second album of reiki music I have downloaded which advertises a bell every three minutes, but there ARE NO BELLS! Why?? We need the bells. We want the bells. Come on, Amazon and reiki music people! Give us bells!!"
"Deeply moving... <SEP> This had to be one of the most moving songs I have heard in many, many years. If you have ever known a true love or have ever loved someone very deeply, this song will speak to you in a very special way. I am so happy for the experience of listening to this song the first time -- but it gets even better time after time."
Five Stars <SEP> This CD was an excellent collection and pleased me very much
"Explore this composer's work <SEP> Beautiful music, beautifully executed. Barbara Harbach is a contemporary American composer that should not be missed for her lyricism and her accessibility to music lovers at all levels."
gerat <SEP> love the movie and song is just as good as it was in the movie
"Disappointed! <SEP> I thought these would be all of Clementi's Opus 36 pieces.  In reality, they are simply the same music over and over at different tempos.  I'm very disappointed."
"not the only I wanted <SEP> I actually downloaded it for a friend of mine who needed it for a dance, not that I like it."
Modern alternative music at its best. This song is a must for your portable ... <SEP> Modern alternative music at its best.  This song is a must for your portable electronic player's playlist.
"This is free elsewhere <SEP> Wow, how absolutely horrible of you Amazon... this was released for free, do not buy this, go to the Scion A/V website (google it) and they have an assortment of free eps from KNOWN metal bands, and the songs aren't just half-hearted ""let's cash in and spew some crap out"", they're good and full-release quality songs.  Enslaved, Arsis, Suffocation, and this ep.  All free.  You're a tool if you buy this. period."
"Music <SEP> This is one of our favorite Christmas songs.
We really enjoy listening to music.
Thank you for the oppertunity to download it."
One Star <SEP> I don't remember buying this
OUTSIDE INTRUDER <SEP> LOVED  THIS  SOUNDTRACK  VERY  MUCH  REMINDS  ME  OF  THE  ACTUAL MOVIE  AND  HOW  THEY  USED  THIS  SOUNDTRACK  TO  ARRANGE  THE  INTRODUCTION  OF  ALL  THE  CHARACTERS  WHO  ARE  IN  THIS  MOVIE  AND  OF  COURSE  THE  AVENGERS  REALLY  LOVED  THE  PART  WHERE  CAPTAIN  AMERICA  CAUGHT  HIS  SHIELD  AND  THOR  WAS  CATCHING  HIS  HAMMER  AND  WHEN  THE  CHARACTER  THAT  SUPPOSE  TO  BE  HAWK EYE  WAS  FALLING  AND  AT  THE  SAME  TIME  SHOT  HIS  ARROW  WHILE  FALLING  BACKWARDS  BUT BLACK  WINDOW  ACTUALLY  DOES  WHAT  CAPAIN AMERICA  DID  IN  THE  COMIC  BOOK  WHEN  HE  WAS  BEING  TIED  TO  A  CHAIR  AND  BEING  TORTURED  BY  THE  RED  SKULL  LOVE  THIS  SONG  VERY  MUCH  THIS  SONG  FIT  RIGHT  INTO  WHAT  THE  AVENGERS  WOULD  BE  DOING  IT  DEFINES  THEM  AS  A  TEAM ALSO  LOVED  THE  WAY  IRON  MAN  FACE  MASK  DROPS  RIGHT  OVER  HIS  FACE  ITS  TIME  TO  TAKE  CARE  BUSINESS  WHEN  THAT  HAPPENS  !
"Complex media, totally refreshing <SEP> Downloaded from CDBaby a few days ago.  Great mix of pop with a traditional and/or broadway flair uniquely her own....very catchy. Lyrics are also phenominal and unique and linger as well. Can't wait for the rest of the EP *playing card suits*.  /me wants more!"
"No it's not from Japan. <SEP> To clear up the misconceptions about this album.

Caramell is a Swedish music group who produces ""bubble gum dance"" that is based off electric dance music. They are a band so no they are not ""vocaloids"", They are real people with voice alterations done (mainly speed up as suggested by the album name ""Speedy Mixes""). Bubble gum dance originated in Denmark so this is not a ""j-pop ripoff"", This is what japan the following is based off of.

It is a very fun album to listen to and most of the songs do seem to go together. Listen to the previews and they do give you a good preview of what the album is like."
"This is what you're looking for. <SEP> If you're looking for that incredibly catchy song, Caramelldansen, that's played over all the internet memes with the anime girls, this is the album with the original meme version of the song on it. By ""original meme version"" I mean it is the speedycake ""remix"", which means it has been sped up to approximately 1.2 times its original speed (it shouldn't even be called a remix). Because of that, I will say that this is not the ""original"" version of the song that appeared on Caramell's original album Supergott because that version was, of course, played at 1.0 times speed. But don't let that confuse you, this is Caramell's original performance and everything, just sped up. You probably heard the sped up version, so this album is what you want.

You could just get the first track, but if you like Caramelldansen then you will like the rest of the album. It is Caramell's album Supergott but with all the songs sped up to 1.2 times their original speed to match Caramelldansen. If you like the style and vocals of the first song, you'll like the rest of the songs too. They are all mind-destroyingly catchy songs in the ""bubblegum dance"" genre (did you know that was a genre? I didn't) that you won't easily get out of your head. Priceless."
"just don't unless you like thus kind of music <SEP> It's all just the same vocals over and over again with different people or voicaloids its hard to tell
The only reason I give this 2 stars is because of the bass"
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song!
My kind of music. <SEP> Great album.
Fav song <SEP> I love it!!!! It gets me pumped when I work out!! I especially like Nicki Minaj. Justin Beiber is ok though.
Breath of fresh air for the soul! <SEP> Like a breath of fresh air for the soul!
"Not a good representation for klezmer music, at all!! <SEP> Very poorly arranged klezmer music.  Yuk.!"
"hilarious <SEP> As the title states,  the song is hilarious it's funny.  I like funny songs like this.  Happy New Year everyone."
MP3 Song  Never got it <SEP> Never ever got it. so how can I write a review so la la la la la la la la
Five Stars <SEP> This is great!
"Relentless Drum Solo(s) <SEP> I'm pretty sure this tune was orignally part of a 10-inch Emarcy LP titled ""Hamp in Paris."" (Dig the Polackesque cover design).

What I love about this number is the irresistable  way the drum solo propels the listener (reminscent of the clickety-clack of the rails on a train or the way a strong wind would irresistably move eveything down a  street). I believe both Hamp and Curley Hammer traded choruse and played partly in unison. Worth a listen."
Not Suitable <SEP> My 8 year old Granddaughter bought this song. I removed it from her Kindle and placed the mp3 in the trash. This song should be removed from amazon
One Star <SEP> It is a bad song
"Best cover I've ever heard. <SEP> Jess Moskaluke is so talented, and her cover of ""Try"" by P!nk just makes me smile really brightly whenever I hear it, though it's supposed to be a more sad song in parts. 5/5 stars."
A fun listen <SEP> Was on an Iron Man high. Really liked this song the most out of the whole soundtrack. Now all I need is my own Iron Man suit.
"Not for me <SEP> I love Bing, but don't like this CD. It's my fault for buying it without listening to the songs. I know the titles so thought it was safe. Well, I was wrong and very disappointed and wasted my money. I don't like the arrangements and tempo. I miss the other versions of these songs. My bad/"
What about songs included? <SEP> Can anybody tell me which are the songs included in this album? Crosby and Cole made a lot of work together and I am afraid I may already have some or many of the songs in  other albums edited under different names. Thanks a lot.
Do not buy for any type ceremony <SEP> Purchased fir a funeral and could not use.  An announcer started off the music introducing the band. Poor decision-making as it ruins the song.
Two Stars <SEP> I want the record by mail because I don't know how to hear by phone
One Star <SEP> It was horrible wouldn't install to the computer
"Poor writing and soloing with capable Big Band. <SEP> Utterly bland and boring attempt at ""modern"" style of piano. Cliches abound both in writing and hysterical playing of a piano playing soloist.
The Stockholm Jazz Orchestra could do so much better by inviting true Jazz musicians as writers and soloists. They sound capable of making much better music than this unfortunate effort."
Lovely version of the traditional song <SEP> This is a very nice rendition of the traditional song.  I particularly like the harmony and hope for much more from this group.
"DO NOT BUY THE DIGITAL VERSION OF THIS ALBUM! <SEP> A word of advice to the unwary:  DO NOT BUY THE DIGITAL VERSION OF THIS ALBUM!  I did; BIG MISTAKE!!!  Took forever to download, when it did, I couldn't do a damned thing with the files.  Couldn't extract them, couldn't move them, couldn't copy them, and last but not least, couldn't copy them onto a mp3 device to play.  Utterly useless, a complete total waste of time, money, energy and aggravation.  SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a plain old-fashioned CD instead; you'll be much better off."
This should be 320 kbps! <SEP> Great album. I would not buy it at Amazon. I was hoping for 320 kbps.  I ended up throwing these files away and getting it on iTunes.
Song review. <SEP> I just really feel this song. I can see many more great things coming from Taylor Momsen. Keep it up girl.  \m/ \m/
muy buen corridaso <SEP> Esta muy bueno este corrido pues eso es un corrido por voz de mando musica mexicana ta muy chingon arriba michoacan
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful!
"Sensitive and moving <SEP> A wonderful collection of attractive and sensitive piano pieces featuring Will Ackerman, Jeff Oster and others.
Pleasant and moving, I recommend it highly."
Time After Time <SEP> I was very much impressed with the audio quality of this song. It sounded as if the song was just released with today's technology.
Listening to Diane's music will give you peace. Many ... <SEP> Listening to Diane's music will give you peace.  Many times a week I will play her music while having the sound on the TV muted.  It comes direct from angelic realms.  Thank you Diane!
Great 60's Bossa Nova Fun <SEP> A hoot!  Bossa Nova from the 60's!  Loved the instrumentation and arranging of this somewhat kitschy rendition of The Face I Love. Brings back memories of that period of music and the styles of arranging and recording.  GG
stupid bad song <SEP> pathetic lyrics from an intelligent writer.  accidentally bought this garbage when pandora shuffled me to wrong spot.  bad pandora!  worse amazon for posting up such a crap song.
"TERRIBLE!! <SEP> TERRIBLE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY--SEE THE NAMES OF THE OTHER PERFORMER ON THE ALBUM COVER--HARD TO READ--BUT THE CO-PERFORMERS WITH MR BENNET ARE  N-O-T WHAT YOU WOULD THINK. NO PAUL MCCARTNEY--NO GAGA- NO WILLIE NELSON- NO DEAN MARTIN (READ LABEL CLOSELY IT IS D-A-N MARTIN.
THEY ARE A BUNCH OF SINGERS I NEVER HEARD OF....IF YOU ARE EXPECTING THE ""GOOD"" DUETS,SUCH AS SHOWN ON U-TUBE--GAGA,ETC ETC--LOOK AT ANOTHER ALBUM---BECAUSE THIS ONE IS PURE JUNK.
IF TONY BENNET SAW THIS UNKNOWN ARTIST'S ALBUM HE WOULD PULL IT OUT OF PRODUCTION,,,,"
Not on cd only download <SEP> Doesn't come on cd only MP3 download I would buy the cd but not a download
"Great CD! <SEP> A Friend let me listen to this, she'd gotten it through her Church.  Didn't realize it would be as soul stirring as it is.  I'm writing a review because I came to Amazon to see if they had it in stock . . . and they do so I'm buying it. I really enjoyed this one!!!"
"Can't stop listening. <SEP> This is a wonderfully masterful recording of songs both new and old. The melodies and harmonies are intricate and exciting, and it is music that I can worship with rather than simply listen to."
"Meh. <SEP> Great lyrics, and I've been a big IG fan for some time. Sent away for this as soon as it got announced. I completely support the premise of what they're doing and love to introduce their music to our congregation.

Although musical creativity has NEVER been Indelible Grace's strong suit, the musical arrangements by vol. 6 are really getting stale.  Believe it or not, there ARE other chords besides G, C, D, and Em.

Some time ago we were really rocking in this whole hymn rewrite movement. Sojourn came out with ""Over The Grave"", and IG was putting out stuff like Osenga's ""O Help My Unbelief"" and Smith's ""Lo He Comes."" Unfortunately I think this movement has seriously hit the skids as the music becomes progressively more boring and predictable.

Sadly it seems taboo to subject other Christians to a serious musical critique these days and its even harder in a small community where many folks are friends of the artists.  All I can say is no heart judgment here.  I worship the risen King right along with the artists, no doubt.  But looking at it from a strictly musical perspective (i.e., if the album as instrumentals were to be given to me without vocals), it would be a one-listen-only album."
"A pleasant surprise <SEP> Picked this up after hearing a tune on a tv show. A mix of styles, some I like more than others. Overall great ambient music when studying or socializing. Eponymous song is excellent. Look forward to following this artist"
Five Stars <SEP> good song
Five Stars <SEP> Truly the best Christmas song that ever existed...
"That's the song! <SEP> Romance authors often have someone in drawing rooms, at musicals or musicians singing or playing Greensleeves. I finally went to Amazon to hear a few bars and realized I'd heard it the music many times in the past. Usually at holiday programs as What Child is This. It is a lovely song and well worth listening to when I just need a few moments to myself."
would recommend! <SEP> rj- always a sonic pleasure! would recommend!
Five Stars <SEP> Great old school song!
"O.N.I.F.C !!! <SEP> Great Album, Huge Wiz Khalifa Fan, GREAT MUSIC #TGOD #CABINFEVER....keep up the good work and stay humble with your work!"
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent book, loved it."
"Blues Rock and Roll at its finest! <SEP> Simply put: this album is worth every penny. And more! I find myself listening to Whiskey & Rattlesnakes in all sorts of settings and moods, and it always seems to do the trick. Jake Salley is an excellent singer and writes honest, catchy songs. Check this dude."
Speechless! What an emotional and spiritual experiece with this ... <SEP> Speechless! What an emotional and spiritual  experiece with this song. Praise be to God!! Currently doing a praise dance using this song.
Great Music <SEP> I formerly went to The Village and the music was always trying to exalt God.  This album moves right along with that theme.
"Raw Honest Emotion That Tugs At Your Heart <SEP> With a cool varied style, a dynamic vocal range combined with the upbeat music, ""That's All"" looks at a one sided relationship. You will flow through the lyrics discussing the dedication and love that is extremely unbalanced, if reciprocated at all. The song is under shadowed by the hope for change that isn't coming in this relationship.

While the relationship may not have delivered on expectations, Benny and this song did. Listening to the melody and his voice on song gives you a feeling of warmth and comfort like the perfect pair of blue jeans.

Hailing from Annapolis, Maryland, Benny enjoyed local success with his college band. After graduation he recorded his first album ""Teller"" in his parent's garage. With a brief stint in Nashville to hone his songwriting skills, Benny moved to Los Angeles and formed the band, The Kings Royal, which he put on hiatus to go solo.

Be on the look out for his three song EP titled ""One More Chance"" featuring the songs ""Brass Ring"", ""Bitter"" and ""In Your Arms""."
"Present <SEP> Marcy is so very talented, but way more than that, this track is so comfortable. It's Christmas and I feel like she and I are singing about Jesus in His presence. WOW!"
"Spoiled the Beautiful Song by having this Remix <SEP> I heard the song on a WSJ interview of Priyanka Chopra. I really liked it and decided to download the song. By mistake, downloaded this Remix. I don't know what prompted Priyanka to approve this Remix. It's horrible. You should try to succeed on your own merits and not try to piggyback some other group, especially as horrible as LA Riots."
"Hilarious <SEP> As soon as I saw the video for @$$ on the Internet, I had to download the song. Great lyrics and just generally funny."
"AMAZING! <SEP> There wasn't a single part of this song disliked, it sounds PERFECT and it has quickly become on of my favorite Il Volo songs."
A fantastic progressive house track. <SEP> A fantastic progressive house track.
Great song. <SEP> 5 Stars. Great song.
Enjoy it often <SEP> Very pleasant sound. Enjoy it often.
Five Stars <SEP> BEST PAS NEOS ALBUM!
Amazing display of talent! <SEP> Trevor Hoehne is an absolute boss! Not to mention there is a killer pump up crew poem in the middle of the song!
"Cannot download - must listen in app - why buy?? <SEP> No problem with the music, but I hate that you can't download the music you buy. I didn't know this before this purchase. I bought audio books in the past and downloaded them, so I assumed I would be able to download the music too. Nope. Must listen in Amazon Music app.
WHY? I BOUGHT it - I can listen to it on the app for FREE as a Prime member. That makes no sense and I'm not happy."
"Editorial Review By Alex Handerson, Music Critic <SEP> Alain Rozan
""Man of No Importance""/""Never Leave the Moon"" (Single)
Review by Alex Henderson
3.5 stars (out of 5)

(Alex Henderson is a journalist/music critic whose work has appeared in Billboard, Spin, The L.A. Weekly, Creem, HITS, Jazziz, JazzTimes, CD Review, Skin Two, Black Radio Exclusive, Thrash Metal and a long list of other well known publications. Known for his eclectic tastes, Alex has contributed several thousand CD reviews to The All Music Guide online and series of reference books since 1996. Jello Biafra, Sonny Rollins, Megadeth, Ice Cube, Live, Chick Corea, Public Enemy, Marduk, Bobby Brown, Ra and Everlast are among the many well known artists Alex has interviewed during his long career.)

Alain Rozan is a veteran singer/songwriter who was born and raised in France but has lived in the United States since 1981.  Rozan performs in both French and English, which is a plus because both languages can be great vehicles for creative expression (French has worked well for everyone from Edith Piaf to Francoise Hardy to Charles Aznavour).  But Rozan, who is now based in New York City, sticks to English on his 2012 single, ""Man of No Importance""/""Never Leave the Moon.""  And both songs demonstrate that after 31 years in the U.S., Rozan has no problem expressing himself in English.  Rozan, at this point, sings with only slight traces of a French accent, and on the melancholic ""Man of No Importance"" and the equally melancholic b-side ""Never Leave the Moon,"" he favors a gentle, laid-back, pastoral folk-rock approach along the lines of Harry Chapin and Gordon Lightfoot.  Fans of Nick Drake should also have no problem getting into these two songs.

""Man of No Importance,"" which is about one of society's underdogs, is very much in the troubadour tradition.  Rozan is an effective storyteller, and he has no problem bringing the character to life.  ""Man of No Importance"" is performed in a spare, minimalist acoustic setting, which is a plus because that approach really makes Rozan's deep, warm vocals and poetic lyrics stand out.  And the use of acoustic guitar also serves him well on ""Never Leave the Moon.""  That song is an appropriate companion for ""Man of No Importance"" because it also deals with loss and disappointment.  Neither ""Never Leave the Moon"" nor ""Man of No Importance"" will be accused of being happy, escapist songs; both thrive on melancholia.

Rozan has rocked out on some of his other recordings, including the edgy ""Junk Bond Junkie"" and a passionate cover of Eddie Cochran's ""Summertime Blues.""  But Rozan obviously isn't going for edgy on either ""Man of No Importance"" or ""Never Leave the Moon.""  On this single, Rozan's softer side prevails and does so with lovely results."
"Wonderfully Unique! <SEP> This band has a very unique celtic sound to their music.  Whatever your path in life, these songs will speak to everyone.  I found this band via youtube, and I am so happy I did!  I have bought both their albums, and thoroughly enjoy the different rhythms, the mythologies that are referenced."
Defected product <SEP> CD was skipping very badly was defected and useless
another dream creak maker <SEP> It didn't worked. I have try it now for over a month a nothing has changed. I don't recommend this product. To me it is a phony.
"Awesome music from a talented artist <SEP> Awesome music from a talented artist whom I stumbled across on Youtube, definitely check out his YT Channel to see some raw and uncut sessions.."
"Great <SEP> I highly recommend this set for any pipe organ buff.  It tells the story of Aristide Cavaille-Coll, a 19th century French organ builder, who introduced many innovations in organ building.  Many of his organs still exist today, and this set shows 15 of his best examples from small to large.  Great photography, and excellent sound, even on my old-time two channel TV, but is also in Digital surround sound.  Five discs, including three DVD's and two CD's make for lots of music and information about these organs.  Get a copy!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> best damn song i have heard in a while
Five Stars <SEP> They are wonderful singers
"lovethiersound <SEP> great vocals, music, energy, fun fun and so easy on the ears ... and eyes, ""Wings"" / beautiful, lush, magical"
"Another great album from Ryan Farish <SEP> If you like Ryan Farish or you are a fan of melodic contemporary music with a beat you would like this. It features a combination of piano, acoustic guitar, synthesizers, and percussion. Always tastefully done and uplifting. It has a pretty good pace too and I often jog to this music. I think it may be my favorite album right now."
Something New: Motown Lost & Found <SEP> This item is a must have for all Mary Wells fans or Motown fans. It is a shame these recordings were not released earlier when Mary was still alive. I feel like the public suffered and was cheated due to these songs being withheld from us. It felt like Christmas when I received my copy. I cannot stop listening to it. It does not get any better. It is Mary Wells and Motown at its best! This music is healing to the soul.
Fantastic <SEP> Always searching for more Mary Wells songs and never disapointed with anything by her.  Appreciate these unreleased songs finally being made available.  No one who likes Mary will be disapointed.
Waylon hits another one out of the park. <SEP> Loved it!!  Only Waylon could put this song over.
"American Flag Waving Music! <SEP> I first heard this piece of music in April 2004 on the campus of Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas. The WSU Concert Band did an EXEMPLARY job of showcasing it. In many ways their rendition was SUPERIOR to this recording. However, I wanted to have this recording of ""Air Mail Special"" so I could reminisce and reflect and pretend that I just disembarked from my personal time machine that took me back to c. 1950 America.

This music reminds me of everything that is good and great about the U.S.A. If you have never heard this piece (but still like jazz), then you will probably enjoy this version with Lionel Hampton as the featured vibraphonist. It's only 99 cents--what are you waiting for?"
Excellent Song! <SEP> The song was fabulous. I have learned of so many artists thru watching Sons of Anarchy. Because I loved this song on the show - I researched who the artist was and actually have purchased additional songs of the Bihlman Brothers. I love their music!
"Awesomeness!!! <SEP> This remix is so much better than the boring ""outdated"" original mix! I listen to the other remixes and they are okay but the ""Razed in Black"" remix will be the hit of my Halloween party this year!!"
"Creative and Unique <SEP> I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this album.  The song: Star, Baby has 3 different genres/styles within one song.  Crazy International is just a really catchy head bumping song.  If you're looking for some good indie rap/hip hop check out this album."
A little disappointed. So much sreaming and yelling in the background. No good. <SEP> Why would I want to hear the people yelling and screaming during a music session. Totally wrong.  Thats just my feedback.
"Awesome Vibe! <SEP> This album has an awesome vibe. I definitely recommend this album for anyone who wants to tap their feet, bob their heads, and make their souls dance!  All three tracks are well composed and sound great, but the last track ""Silver Lining"" is my favorite.  I am so transfixed by its smooth and beautiful texture. It tells me a story each time I hear it! Louis Fouche is definitely one of the Jazz Greats! Can't wait until his next album comes out!"
another chance jerome wiggins <SEP> i love this song thank god for a second chance. he has a really nice voice i am so proud of him
Five Stars <SEP> Good song if you enjoyed the movie.
"Corny, but well worth a watch! <SEP> Its a cheesy movie that's well worth the watch. I like how its the story we all know, but done in a different way. The way characters are exaggerated can make you groan, but it all goes to the humor of the show.  I especially like the Bollywood style ending."
"WTH? <SEP> I have been trying to purchase this song and when it downloads to my cloud player it states ""Your download will begin shortly'' and nothing gets downloaded!!"
"HEM is by far my favorite group. Talk about beautiful songs <SEP> HEM is by far my favorite group. Talk about beautiful songs, amazing voices and music that is so peaceful. I hope they keep producing this great sound."
going through it for another birth... <SEP> HOW does this cd have 5 stars? there are some seriously creepy songs on it. Like the kind that wake your children up while they're sleeping and NOT relaxing or calming music. Shocking because some of the songs are great. Better off getting the Pregnancy and Birthing Specialists cd/playlist - much more reliable and way less creepy.
Wonderful <SEP> Beautiful relaxing music that puts your mind and body in a perfect place for laboring and delivery. Took me immediately to a peaceful place.
Great song! <SEP> Juliet has a great voice. Her voice is very unique and she has alot of talent. Very catchy song that will get stuck in your head!
"Good voice, song is ""eh"". <SEP> Juliet's voice is fantastic, one of the best I've ever heard but I don't like this song too much.  I don't really know why, the song is just not that appealing to my ears.  The song sounds good at times, but the makeup and lyrics of the song are pretty substandard.  I see good thing for Juliet in the future if the songs she does could just be better, since her voice is so phenomenal."
"Okay ... <SEP> No too bad. It was allot like his other music. Nothing really all that original I did listen to it a few times to try to see if anything really stuck out, but didn't."
Great Single <SEP> Great single. Very catchy. Good tune listen to just about every day. John Hart great artist needs to come out with more catchy tunes
"Great song by Anita Cochran! <SEP> Love the new Christmas song ""Snowing in My Hometown"" by the very talented Anita Cochran.  Download it at Amazon. Check out the video too!"
Two Stars <SEP> Some aspects are cool but overall it's too chopped up for my taste.
Five Stars <SEP> Great
Five Stars <SEP> flippin awesome
"It Brings A Smile To My Face!!! <SEP> I heard this song for the first time on a long drive back a little over a week ago!  I fell in love with it and had to see if I could get a copy for my listening pleasure, and I did!  Thanks to Amazon for having just about everything!  If you haven't listened to it, give it a try, but you won't hear the best part which is near the end of the song.  I guarantee it will bring a smile to your face!"
beautiful voice <SEP> This girl can sing!!!!!!!!!!! Cannot wait for her next cd to come out with a little more love songs. Keep her in mind when looking for a nice strong voice.
"They keep trying to make her into something she's not -- she's not pretty or sexy <SEP> I agree with the first reviewer.  Her handlers really messed up her singling career. They keep trying to make her into something she's not -- she's not pretty or sexy, and her songs and videos are boring.  She would have done much better in R&B, where real talent counts and her amazing voice could be properly showcased, and the genuineness she showed on xFactor appreciated. Seems like she's lost that too now though."
"Misrepresented <SEP> There is no hypnotic induction in this brief (10 minutes and 3 seconds) program whatsoever. This is NOT a hypnosis program - it is just some guy giving a quick 'rah-rah' type peptalk. The peptalk was pretty good, but because of the title, this was not what I understood myself to be buying. This item is badly misrepresented. Without an induction it wasn't even worth the .99 I paid for it. Save your money."
"Not for me. <SEP> I'm not knocking this one. I just did not like the voice on here so much. JC's apps really puts me in a trance to work. This one just did not feel right for me, even though I gave it a good try. I had high hopes that fizzled."

"An Unusual Story, an Unusual Artist <SEP> Boyd Lee Dunlop is an American jazz pianist with a richly colorful past. But nothing quite compares to his present - `On October 4, 2012 - Boyd Lee and his brother Frankie were inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of fame. Boyd played a concert that evening in front of fellow inductees past and present. PRESIDENT'S AWARD: The Dunlop Brothers- Piano player Boyd Lee is enjoying a career resurgence after being ""rediscovered"" in a Buffalo nursing home at age 85.' And after this moment of fame Dunlop suffered a major myocardial infarction that left him on death's doorstep for six minutes. After this journey to the other side Dunlop made this recording THE LAKE REFLECTIONS which is simply a great jazz pianist offering solo piano improvisations in response to a series of photographs of Lake Erie during all seasons - reproductions of these photographs are graciously included in this album as it appears in the CD format.

The eight improvisations - First Drops of Rain, America the Peaceful, The Lake, From the Creekbed, Scattered Showers, Snow on the Water, Kick the Critic Out (where that came form is anybody's guess!), and Sunset Turmoil - are mysteriously beautiful. There are moments when it seems as though Dunlop is referencing passages form classical music pieces and other when old standards appear.  But above all are the random and very virtuosic improvisations on his own momentary themes.  He is 86 years old at the time of this recording.  It is a testimony to a life well lived.  Grady Harp, January 13"
Salsa <SEP> I wish I could have listened to it first but couldn't on the website.  I wanted something more like the Gaton Project Latin Lounge.
Five Stars <SEP> This is very uplifting song!!
Sounded reasonably good in the beginning but deteriorated <SEP> This was not a lucky choice from the 30 second sampling.  Sounded reasonably good in the beginning but deteriorated.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"Pulling me through <SEP> This song has been embedded in my heart and spirit so greatful for the ministry of song.
Thanking God for your Gift"
"Gentle and Soothing <SEP> A great song, very peaceful and moving. A must have to any music collection. Even if you do not understand the words, the emotion that comes through will leave you breathless."
Four Stars <SEP> Good.
Stinks! <SEP> Sounds more like karaoke than what I used to listen to on the radio.  Would love to refund this purchase.
They've got Junior but they don't have Hank... <SEP> Great song - love the verse where he ties in dead music stars. The whole thing just makes fun of poppy country music - it's terrific!
"review of the Rojac story <SEP> I thought this was a CD, not a vinyl record. I was disappointed; maybe it should have been made clearer. Thanks"
"Tell's a story all on it's own. <SEP> The thing that I enjoy most about this soundtrack is the emotional depth it travels. There are some really unique twists and turns in the music that get my heart pumping just listening to it. What set's this whole score album apart is the fact that it tells a clear story through the music. There is an obvious journey the composer meant the audience to travel and it translates beautifully. The ambient vocals that are over a few of the tracks offer a chilling and beautiful representation of the struggle that I think is happening with in all of us. My two favorite songs are ""The Village Beach"" and ""Sad Realization"" You won't be disappointed spending the few dollars it costs to get this album!"
"Another Great Indie Band <SEP> It truly amazes me the garbage I hear on the radio yet bands like these don't get any recognition. Well, if you came across this album on Amazon you are probably curious about them. Let me just make this crystal clear, you should buy this album. The songs are well written, the lyrics are catchy, the recording quality is top notch, it's just another gem out there waiting to be grabbed. Come Take My Hand and Always, to Belong are singles waiting to happen and are my favorite songs on the album. You can't pass this amazing album up!"
Great Debut <SEP> Fans of 32 leaves will not be disappointed.  Very unique sound in a world of Nickelback wannabes.  Definitely a album you can listen to from start to finish without skipping a single track.  Buy this album.

Five Stars <SEP> Tame Impala has a unique sound.
"Reinventing the bowed guitar! <SEP> Jonathan Eric Wilson is the one responsible for bringing the bowed guitar into the spotlight, by reinventing the idea that originated in classical instruments such as Arpeggione and Viola Da Gamba. So this is a musical offering straight from the source and the master. Opening ""Marianela""drips with romantic overtones, very smooth guitar work and some warm growling bass lines. ""I'll follow the Sun"" drifts into a dreamy world and relaxing atmosphere that reminds you of long gone, warm Summer evening and romantic dinner under the stars. ""Moon Fog"" slowly picks up a pace with some nice classical approach and beautiful bowed melodies. ""Au Claire De Lune"" takes you on a moody journey with sparkling sounds and reminds you to slow down and appreciate life. ""Before I Send You Away"" is a dirge and agony of partying ways with one of the GuitarViols so lovingly built overtime by Jonathan, it is the moment of cutting the umbilical cord between the maker and the amazing gift that this instrument is going to be to it's destined player. ""Chamomile"" presents itself with some melancholy piano work, and dreamy GuitarViol melodies interwoven into the fabric of space and time.
""The Scorpion Elder"" takes us into a movie soundtrack territory, and showcases Jonathan's fascination with hard rock and ripping guitar solos, as well as epic tapestries behind the lead lines. ""Ripples"" calms things down and leads us into ""Unto The King"" with very rich, layered GuitarViol arrangement. ""Vivaldi's Drunken Stupor"" continues where the previous track left off, and offers some dirge like wailing bowed melodies. ""The Big Blue"" takes you on a car ride through out a country side and on a lazy Summer afternoon.  ""Pater Noster"" closes the album with a combination of driving rhythms and gregorian chants that conjure images of a medieval action movie.
All in all ""GuitarViol"" presents us with a different face of Jonathan, a person with deep passion for building amazing instruments, and love for music. Highly recommended to just about anyone with an appetite for beautiful, and meaningful sound! 5 stars!!!"

"Wow... <SEP> I've been an avid fan of this band since I saw them on MTV's ""120 Minutes"" in 1987 with the video ""Faith Healer"", so the release of this album (their first since 1990) was a major event for me.  I was prepared to be disappointed, but I'm happy to say the exact opposite is the case. As much as I worship ""Heavens"" and ""Craps"" as two of the best albums of all time, ""Crashes on the Platinum Planet"" is at least as good, if not better. All of the songs are great, and there has been much justified buzz about Gary Waleik's compulsively catchy composition, ""Robert Pollard"". But the best songs on the album are, in my opinion, the beautiful, sad ""Happy New Year"" by Bill Goffrier, and what I consider to be Gary Waleik's masterpiece, ""Sarah and Monica"". It is one of the most beautiful, hook-filled songs I've heard in a very long time. The ""C"" section of this song is absolutely Beatles, and it sends shivers down my spine like any preternaturally gorgeous bit of music should.

The Goffrier/Waleik song ""New Machine"" rocks just like the good old days (with biting lyrics). And it is great to see drummer Jeff Oliphant's song writing develop with ""Princess Warrior"" (an inspiring song about fighting breast cancer), and especially his elegiac song with Bill, ""Forget the Chef"".

This band's musical ingenuity has always been incredible. The added element of maturity makes them all the more must hear. And you must hear. Buy it now."
"She's NOT fetching! <SEP> OK, so it's been years and years since I felt at all inspired to review music on Amazon, but this is genuinely awful.

I'm a huge fan of 80s Indie rock. Indeed, I'm one of those geezers who thinks that the 80s were ""It."" Everything since then has been to a greater or lesser degree derivative of various movements and displacements that started in the 80s. And I loved such Big Dipper college-radio classics as ""She's Fetching"" and ""Younger Bums."" Likewise, I've owned their limited output in several formats, including LP, cassette tape and, eventually, CD. Knowing the terrible track record of most reunion albums, I was wary, but I was sold on Crashes on the Platinum Planet after reading an effusive review on AV Club that made it sound like the band had recaptured some of its old spark.

Boy, was I suckered. I hate this. Painfully awkward lyrics swaddled in melodic banality, more reminiscent of 80s goofball punk (e.g. The Dead Milkmen or Thelonious Monster) than Big Dipper's earlier albums, and lacking almost all of the harmonizing and virtuoso guitar work that characterized their 80s releases. This album sounds like your dad and his friends extemporizing lyrics and jamming in the garage...and not in a good way.

I paid full price for this on a well-known rival website, listened to it three times, then deleted it. Which I basically never do, because, in the age of terabyte hard drives, space is basically unlimited...so why delete anything you've paid for, ever? In this spirit, I restored it from the Recycle Bin. Then it came up in my media player again today, and I couldn't get past two songs without feeling profoundly annoyed. Had this been released 25 years ago, I would have dumped the cassette or LP within a week, and I know now that I'll never listen to it again. Deleted for a second time, this time for good."

"Hmm A geezer's review <SEP> Elferya's first full album. I love female fronted metal bands this album is a well crafted slice of a HUGE pie, 4 stars? The singer is a little lacking for this genre not enough attitude or variations in her voice, EDEN'S FALL their second album has a different singer that fits this talented band a lot better, this album in its own right is good but not great"
"Stick to Rock Music <SEP> Absolutely Horrible!!  It sounds like the ravings of a depressed Alcoholic mumbling his delusional rants into a borrowed cassette recorder (complete with unedited switch clicking).  Mr. Russell should stick to Rock Music .  Contrary to one review, he is definitely not Neil Young.  Please sample this POS before you spend  your hard earned money."
"Pleasantly Surprised! <SEP> This album contains all the build and drive that I look for in an album; captures well the zeitgeist in music.  I was caught off guard by this and continue to be stunned.  Track 3 = My fave.  Cheaper than a number 4 at McDonald's, this album doesn't leave me weighted down or tied in knots.  Well done!"
"Five Stars <SEP> NICE CD, NICE TRANSACTION A+"
"Great hard to find performances <SEP> Loved the movie and the music. In particular, probably the best English rendition of ""Perfidia"" by Linda Ronstadt is on the soundtrack. Her powerful voice comes across crisper and clearer on this version, I think, than the popular Spanish version on the Frenesi Album. Anyway, this is the only avenue (legit) to the English one."
Four Stars <SEP> Love the music from this movie.
"Great song <SEP> It's just a really, really great song. Very fast, fairly upbeat. Crush 40 knocks it out of the park again."

Dream <SEP> Thumbs down and definetly not Dreams finest pieces of work! Not one good song on the whole cd. I wouldn't waste your money on this purchase.
"Ugh <SEP> This comes from a hardcore old school Green Day fan. I first saw them in Isla Vista, CA in 1992; lived down the street from the band in Berkeley in the mid '90s, once even visiting their pad to smoke out with 'em; introduced my mom to Billie Joe; and got backstage on the 21st Century Breakdown tour, where BJ bought back the GD shirt I'd had for nearly two decades for two (autographed) hundred dollar bills.

Green Day have had their ups and downs over the many years, but I have always stuck with them through mediocre releases and/or questionable quality performances. That being said, ""Nightlife"" is the SINGLE WORST Green Day song I have EVER heard! It flat out sucks!!

""Nightlife"" features Lady Cobra, some lame female so-called rapper that could not rhyme her way out of a paper bag. Her pathetic attempt to appear sexy with breathy, seductive lyrics falls way flat. The song drones and drags and is not fun to listen to. BJ sounds bored to tears on the track.

I am and have always been open to checking out new styles from Green Day. I've never expected them to maintain their old sound forever or always play the same way. ""Nightlife"" is, however, a step in the wrong direction. Hopefully when Billie gets out of rehab, he will have cleared his head enough to realize that this musical angle with this Lady Cobra clown is a complete and total fail.

I recommend ""Stray Heart"" from Dos! or ""Nuclear Family"" from Uno! instead."
"All I'm hearing is a bad Who demo tape cover album <SEP> Billie wrote most of these songs while messed up on another go-round with amphetamines, and it shows. Sloppily written, produced, and played, and down right childish compared to the last 3 albums. It's barely listenable after the 2nd or so time, and all the songs kind of blend together into a halfway ok melody of ""bleh."" It's really a shame, considering this was supposed to be the come back to their older, more punk driven roots. All I'm hearing is a bad Who demo tape cover album."
Doesn't sound much like the version I hear at sporting events. <SEP> This version lacks anything that gets me going like the version I hear at sporting events.  Just doesn't do it for me.

"PSO fans of the music will love this! <SEP> I am a HUGE video game music connoisseur and I own many soundtracks of video games. My reason for owning so many? Video game music is an art. It is the art of creating the mood for the games you play. Wether it be something as demonic and ambient as Silent Hill music, or as melodic and symphonic as Phantasy Star On-line music, it gives mood to the games you play.

This CD is a remix of all the songs that I have come to love and enjoy on this CD. I listen to it while driving down the road. My favorite song is probably the 3rd to last song on the CD, which is probably the best boss fight song I've ever heard. You must get this amazing CD!"

"A treatise against Drudkh, and a plea <SEP> I have read multitude of reviews and have heard endless praises about Autumn Aurora.  The most significant observation about this album is how much it contributed to the rise of romantic naturalism in the popular conscious of the black metal community.  Even the more 'enightened' hipster is well aware of Drudkh.  But unlike their contemporaries Wolves in the Throne Room, Drudkh delivers a slightly different styling of naturalist black metal.  And not only that, their largest fanbase actually comes from within the extreme metal community unlike WitTR.  Many black metal elite are actually give the loudest applaud to Autumn Aurora.  I cannot deny their influence to push black metal in this new spiritual direction I adore.  So I have to confront this album directly and make a critical observation despite my reservations of this band.  It is important, for if I can observe and accept the innovations this band has made, it will permit me then to be frank about what I feel are their critical failings that I believe do damage to this subgenre of naturalist black metal.

And I feel compelled to immediately address what I think is this band's most grevious issue.  Autumn Aurora does not simply present a message of the beauty of nature at its most pure and man's reverence for it.  No there is so much more.  Interwoven deep into this purely landscape music is in fact a deeply impassioned energy the band and its members hold dear.  This album, like a landscape painting, is not simply any landscape... it is a Ukrainian one.  And as such like a lot of romanticist landscape painting, these silent forests and brushes of long grass hiding black glistening creeks serves as a very powerful symbol of that holy land and what it means to the people that look upon it.  The emotion pregnant in this music and this landscape is a gripping anthem to the pride of a nation.  The ancient woods have become a symbol of an apparent eternal ideal that has been lost in the modern world... the modern nation of Ukraine.  Drudkh has stated that their music is apolitical.  But even those who heartedly support this band know in fact that this music is all about a misty-eyed pride for a world they see as pure and currently in threat of extinction.

Ive tlaked about the concept of cultural pride in music.  Its truly a difficult subject, because in the grip of the modern, soul-sucking world, where people must grapple with the evils and spiritual waste they see around them, it can be very easy for the dissolutioned to grip onto cultural pride and take it an empassioned step further into nationalism.  It's easier and more instinctual for people to forego observation, and reason and blame the extremely muti-faceted problems of their world on others who are alien to them.  The next step then, a cry for the 'return of the old values'.  To return to a homogeneous society where the foreign and dissenting are silenced and purged.  Though Autumn Aurora is devoid of any direct politics, like a fine landscape work of a nation's wilderness, this throught free space instead represents a dream of a holy paradise which the artists long to see emerge once again(?) to this world.  To me, the holiest of nature has become an image by which the artist can now dress up into a concept, a cultural one, that is not only transient compared to nature, but also served as a nationalistic call to arms.

Drudkh have denied political motivations and many people have accepted this.  But I feel a close scrutiny of the artists reveals so much evidence to the contrary.  Firstoff we are all well aware the band members before Drudkh were the openly Slavic nationalist group Hate Forest.  Some could say that Drudkh is a departure from that.  But lets see... both Drudkh's first album and Autumn Aurora are published by Supernal, a label run by notorious pro-white eugenicist Alex Kurtagic, a guy who has used his label to publish dissertations and fictional novels speaking of a clandestine conspiracy against the white race.  Drudkh and Hate Forest had a long relationship with this label and its mastermind, and many of the bands side projects have been published under it.  The guys from Drudkh also themselves operate Night Birds.  And with Drudkh member Saenko himself at the helm, Night Birds have released the music of the etxremely anti-Juadic group Bewitched as well as hardcore openly neo-nazi stalwarts Veles and Darkthule.  Drudkh co-founder Thurios is currently and active member in Astrofaes, a band who are far more open about their Slavic nationalism.  Astrofaes has participated on Kurtagic's ridiculous ""Anti-Geldorf compilation, where Kurt and his friends rail against the idea of contributing food and medical care to starving African refugees.  In fact, numerous of Saenko and Thurios's little side projects on Supernal have all contributed to this appallingly disgusting comp.  If Dudkh claims to be against extremist ideologies, then what does all this evidence point to?  I haven't even bothered to check their old interviews.  Im sure there are a couple of nice Nazi easter eggs there.  But I'll leave that up to the reader.  Its now time to get back to the elements of the painting Autumn Aurora and leave its philosophical symbolism.

Naturalist black metal at its highest pinnacle of popularity was typified by the Cascadian scene and its sound.  That is a foundation of burzum style taking influence from post rock progression.  Synths are absent but there are still some acoustic guitars present, now alongside ritualistic percussion and neo-heathen auras.  But these are only accent and the main body of the sound is the electrified rock band setup.  This sound opts also for a lower production quality than even most burzum.  But instead of being an acidic burn like Ildjarn, the tone is muddled into a grey but warm haze, furthering the union with post rock.  And this became the most popular evolution of naturalist black metal.  I have often spoke of an earlier styling that never fully evolved (German mystic metal), but the other dominant school of thought in naturalist black metal was cemented into place by Drudkh and their contemporaries.  And one of its most defining creations is Autumn Aurora.

Here, like the Cascadian sound, burzum is the root influence.  In fact Autumn Aurora is extremely so compared to other albums in the school.  Simple repetitive melodic ideas carrying the music forward with some modest ambient trance inducing qualities.  But the character... it is so much different and the spirit it exudes is dramatically so.  Drudkh have left the cold hateful despondency of burzum's sound and have instead turned to using harmonies lead by shocking major chords.  The music radiates a bright sunnyness not found in burzum or most any black metal in general.  Its warm like light upon the leaves on the albums cover.  To shine such a glowing positivity into the realm of black metal is almost unheard of.  The Cascadian sound far more prefers despondency to this kind of melodic joy.  Far from being ridiculous, Drudkh's burzum-esque reduced recording and repetative haze gives these major chords a glow to them that pushes the music into the realm of a dream or thought barely remembered.  Also unlike the Cascadian sound, Drudkh opts to use the synth, and regularly.  But they politely refrain from overlayering it, giving it mostly one voice at a time and then weaving it in with the single guitar melody.  This then makes up the heart and soul of Autumn Aurora and becomes the key thread on this realm of naturalist black metal.  A hazy glowing epic sound full of life.  Its a wonderful thing to use to speak of nature.

But again, nature is not the main focus here, its nature through a special nationalist filter.  This sunny partially remembered dream, like a religious encounter, is a perfect tool for their message.  For it acts as like looking into a mental landscape, a muddled dream, of some past land full of beauty and purity.  For Drudkh and their listeners, this is a vision of a world they imagine once was 'perfect' and could perhaps one day be again.  Its so perfect... and for that reason, so very toxic.  I can think of many many many epic BM fans who claim to be not openly racist, but are most definitely racial apologists, claiming they can see why neo-nazis are motivated to what they believe and therefore are a lot more sympathetic to them.  The truth of the matter is that although culture can be the servant of nature.. nature cannot be the servant of culture.  The same species that populate the woods in the Ukraine also inhabit the lands of other nations too.  I could continue on, but that is far too great a discussion for this review.

So this is what Autumn Aurora has created.  The other major alternate school to the Cascadian.  Its important to note, many of the black metal bands of this school also tend to mirror the same nationalist ideology that Drudkh and their contemporaries do.  It is the final thread of this style in naturalist black metal.  Sunwheels and Slavic/Germanic warriors abound.  And deep under this surface often lies a extreme ideology of cultural and racial purification of their 'homeland'.  If not openly expounded then as a hazy dream of 'old values' that once were and could be again.  I am sure the ardent believers in this 'dream' will be quick to spite my words and likely will not care anything I write on this, but to all those younger less informed music fans, especially from the indie scene, let this review be a message.  What you get with Drudkh and Autumn Aurora is in fact a test of yourself.  You have to decide for yourself how far your interests in musical appreciation goes, and if it will compromise any anti-racism beliefs you hold.  When you buy the music or promote the bands, you help to spread this message.  And this is the most dangerous thread that I feel must be expunged from naturalist black metal.  You have to ask yourself, what choice will you make?  The music or the values you hold?

---

I chose values.  I love music, but I will not let my indulgence in that go so far as to accept the promotion of things I know to be exceptionally morally wrong.

But in actuallity, and this is my final point, its not that severe of a choice in the case of Autumn Aurora...

When the first song weaves its magic and the melodic ideas develop, I am absolutely amazed.  The power and organic energy within is incredable and is a deeply satisfying experience compaired to any Cascadian song.  Coupled with the album's original artwork, and there is something really fantastic here.  But....  there is a problem.  As I sink deep into this world generated here, the music progresses forward with the same emotional riff, continuous, with little to no alteration.  The songs build a little on the riff, experiment with it, but each time, the single riff is supreme.  I scratch my head.  A couple of times the transcendental synths take a backseat as another long drawn out repetitious riff is introduced.  And as this homogenous landscape expands though Autumn Aurora, and with continuous walks in it, I personally find out that there is in fact not much between these notes.  They wear out their welcome as amazing as they are at times.

I sit back and think.  There is so much here that succeeds over many other naturalist black metal bands.  Drudkh has a grip on something truly great, but as they ponder over this distant shining dream world, I wonder, what would happen if we were to take a step further.  A few more ideas, some cleverness and maybe....  Drudkh's holy landscape, a homogenous culture living on some chosen earth, is a blinding dream.  But nature alone, its still out there.  We can still touch it.  What if this music could move from a hazy dream to a touchable reality?

I still think that the ultimate naturalist black metal album has yet to be made."
"Worth trying <SEP> I listen to a wide range of music, I have a lot of favorites and now I have a new one, the songs are original and are easy to relate to, sung by a voice that is both strong and soothing ."
alright <SEP> I got this because of my friends I really don't like it but if you like otep then you will probably like it
Just funny <SEP> Just funny.  Good fun Christmas song  (B-B-Blue Christmas is the best of them)
Beautiful song <SEP> This is definitely a 5 star song.  Beautiful. Worshipful. Can listen to it over and over.  Would love to have the chord sheet for it.
"I actually enjoyed this album quite a bit <SEP> I actually enjoyed this album quite a bit, many of the songs are pretty typical. However, ""christmas+techno"" is a limited genre, and there are four compilations that have fundamentally the same track list. Not cool."
Great if you love Alvin and the Chipmunks. <SEP> I did not realize these songs were covered by other artists.  The vocals are disappointing.  A few songs remind me of an Alvin and the Chipmunks CD
Performance is excellent. <SEP> Very pleasant and intricate. Performance is excellent.
"Compilation of two solid albums <SEP> This album is a compilation that combines probably one of Garner's best live performances with a album recorded in the UK from the same era.

The first nine tracks are Erroll solo. These were recorded live on August 25, 1962 at the Seattle World Fair and were released in 1963. The sound is excellent and he is in superb form on every track.  Give them a listen in the sound samples on this page to get a hint of his playing. Normally sound samples can tell a big story in a brief snippet, but these just do not do the full tracks justice. I'll personally put the performance on par with any of his live work. And I am not talking about just sound quality. He was like from another world on these tracks.

Tracks 10 through 19 are from an October 19, 1963 session in the UK that was originally released in 1980 as Jazz Groove JG008. These tracks are well represented by the sound samples on this page and have good sound quality (although not to audiophile standards.) Erroll is backed by one of his best rhythm sections - Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums - who add a lot to the tracks in their own right. First, the reason Erroll kept them for a decade was they could keep up with his every twist and turn both improvisational and musical. Erroll would invent amazing stuff as he played and Calhoun not only could support it, but had an uncanny ability to augment it as well. That is amply shown on these final tracks. In fact, this video shot less than three months after these tracks were recorded shows the trio in a live UK performance and is a treat for fans:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erroll-Garner-In-Performance/dp/B00006CXGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erroll Garner - In Performance</a>.

If you are an Erroll Garner fan the first nine tracks are essential to your music library. Those alone are worth the price of this album. However, the remaining tracks are also amazing and add value to this compilation."
Excellent <SEP> If you love Disney music and jazz this is a great find.  The arrangements are some of the best ever.
love <SEP> Sweet music.
"good <SEP> My young daughter is just loving it!

I would recommend it to anyone looking to get music for their children."
"From Phantom Manor's Queue... <SEP> Finally, a full length recording of Phantom Manor's Gazebo Music Box. The hauntingly elegant, trance like tune is also heard (slowed down to some extent) outside of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Holiday. A wonderful track! If only Disney would release more isolated instrumentals from the ride in their original, unedited state."
"Not the best <SEP> Compatible with iTunes and fairly easy download. Initially downloading the song meant that I had to download it a certain way to access it on my computer. It was a little confusing...not super difficult, just a little confusing."
"Free doesn't mean good! <SEP> It was free so I gave it a listen... TERRIBLE MUSIC! I never want to hear this again, not ever!"
"very relaxing <SEP> Even I listen to this album to relax. My two children love this album at bedtime, we've been using this album for 3 years or so, it helps them wind down and works better at blocking sounds than ordinary white noise."
music <SEP> I love love love this music.  I relax to it.  It is so peaceful.  I recommend all there music.  Great for all ages.
Five Stars <SEP> The classic of all classics!!
daughter loves this <SEP> This really helped my daughter relax and go to sleep. It makes me sleepy too! I had to move these songs into their own separate playlist so it wouldn't play for me when I'm at work. LOL
Small price big record <SEP> I really enjoyed the pace of the album.  Lots of upbeat straight forward rocking punk-ish music.  Some of the lyrics fall a little flat occasionally but that is easily overlooked just based on energy alone.
Five Stars <SEP> memories from my growing up days
love <SEP> Sweet music.
nap time <SEP> This really helped my daughter relax and go to sleep. It makes me sleepy too! I had to move these songs into their own separate playlist so it wouldn't play for me when I'm at work. LOL
Five Stars <SEP> good love it
"Classic Miles <SEP> A must add to your MP3 collection Miles never misses a note on  this broadway classic.
doing it as only miles can. Even the most stoic person you know will have to move to Miles
rendition."
"Relaxing!! <SEP> My children are a little old for lullabies, 10 and 12. I actually downloaded all these ""Sleep Like a Princess"" songs for myself because they are truly relaxing and beautiful and I love the cultural aspect of it!! I have terrible anxiety at times and these have helped so much!!"
Beautiful! <SEP> I love listening to this kind of music! It is just so soothing and relaxing to me and other family members.
"One of my all time favorites <SEP> I simply love this song, it's in heavy rotation on every device I own"
One Star <SEP> Not what was expected
"Great Music; a Bit Too Loud to be Sleep Music <SEP> The Lullaby Tribe has a wonderful, sleep-based song here.  It is soothing and relaxing and definitely gets listeners in the mood for sleep.  Unfortunately, the volume is loud enough that it doesn't ever get quiet enough to use as a true sleep-inducing song.  Beautiful music, either way, though."
"Jumps and stumbles <SEP> Track seems defective.  Has skips, fades, and just mediocre quality.  Have re-downloaded, and the problems continues.  Will retry in a few days and re-post I can resolve the problem."
Peaceful <SEP> I use this music for background ambiance in my holistic healing practice.  It creates a very relaxing atmosphere so my clients feel rested.
Awful <SEP> Made me sick to listen such bad music. Was just bad. Wouldn't recomed this to anyone because it is such. A waist of time.
Four Stars <SEP> Awesome
"The best jazz folk I've ever heard <SEP> Chapter Two's ""Moon Shadow"" is better than Cat Stevens', and their ""Killing Me Softly"" is better than Roberta Flack's.  The entire album melts in your ears."
"A cello, not a violin! <SEP> I didn't purchase this, but from listening to the sample, it sounds like cello and piano, not violin and piano as the title suggests."
I Will featuring Tamera Mowry <SEP> This is a beautiful song!!  Jerome Wiggins and Tamera Mowry did a wonderful job with this one!! I am definetly taking this one to church!
just another rap song <SEP> not much to say other the fact its a typical rap song about money cars girls and crime. Just a buck too. u can get it free at other places or even the entire disk cheap.
Five Stars <SEP> Great music
CDR! <SEP> It's a CD-R.  Don't buy this.
"Where is Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away""? <SEP> What the hell? Where's Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away""? If that song was on this, I would purchase it."
Four Stars <SEP> Nice soothing music for baby at a fantastic price!
"Great Song <SEP> I first heard this song in the theater, and it made me smile. In the context of the movie, I hear it as the product of local rock group...that original that was never big but was SOOOO good. I think the mix sort of reflects this too in a subtle way...it doesn't sound overly produced, but not too raw either. This song proves that rock n roll is timeless. A good song is a good song. Melody is catchy, great harmony...great all around like songs of that era and leaves you wanting more (so I just play it twice)."
"The first real dog album from this artist. <SEP> His first album, Distorting the Hertzian Wave, has a lot of appealing but incomplete ideas, but hints at the more fully formed achievements to come. The second, A Declared State of Belligerence, has an oddly claustrophobic and retro synthesizer sound to its production, but grows on you over repeated listenings with a lot of really catchy and sometimes ominous musical ideas. The third and fourth, And Yet It Moves and Brotherhood of Good Explosions, appear to be Spunkshine's peak period, with modern production and catchy tunes, fast, slow and in between. Number Five, Huge Humans, starts to drift into inconsistency with uneven song ideas and an over-reliance on comic samples, but still hits some real high points. Forget this one. It feels tossed off and basically just drones on eventlessly for long periods of time. There's nothing offensive about it, but there's just nothing here at all. This is modern Muzak and that's all. I hope this artist hasn't emptied his trick bag, because the earlier albums are criminally overlooked, but I guess the next one will tell. Given the career arc of most electronic music artists, I'm regretfully not optimistic. Miscellaneous plug: If you're at all interested in this genre, you should be listening to Ulrich Schnauss's A Long Way To Fall. He's one of a kind."
One Star <SEP> Cloudy -- Skips and repeats near conclusion of the song.  Is there a way to fix this?
"Uplifting and powerful <SEP> Thoughtful words and good rhythrm. Great for dance class or just leisure listening.
Especially for women & children, good work."
Two Stars <SEP> It was ok.
ehhh <SEP> Theres about 5 decent (not good) on this album. I know it was only $4 but come on. That is of course just my opinion. You may find 7 or 8 tollerable. Good luck all.
Good song <SEP> Reflects how I feel about things. Just that people need to mind their own business instead of trying to make it harder for others.
"Best soundtrack ever. Of all time!!! <SEP> Best soundtrack ever. Of all time!!! The music goes so well with the movie, even the slow songs. Awesome!!! !"
great sound track to a grate season <SEP> enough said Jeff Williams and the RT crew set it up so good you can't say no to this collection
"Mellow and encouraging <SEP> This young man has an amazing gift!  This is a favorite liston.  His voice is mellow and just enjoy listoning.  Love the songs as well and encourage anyone to get copy of this young mans songs, it will encourage and lift you."
Eric Clapton never disappoints! <SEP> Great tunes!!
EC for me <SEP> EC is a great guitar player / composer - a classic guy
"Not bad for a buck twenty nine <SEP> I have Slowhand in my library with the exception of Cocaine and The Core. I found other Clapton Albums with Cocaine and other tunes that grew my library, but have not found The Core on any other album than Slowhand. So I decided to just buy the single from Amazon. Within a second, I was listening to the song, and my library and files were updated automatically and correctly. Not bad for a buck twenty nine.,."
Epic Rock! <SEP> One of guitar great Eric Clapton's finest moments. Probably the best song on the Slowhand album which has several high points.
Five Stars <SEP> great!
Highly Recommend!! <SEP> This is a great cd and I would highly recommend it to anyone who just loves all music genres.
One Star <SEP> was different than i thought
"Meh <SEP> After a few attempts, I have yet to finish listening to this song. I forced myself to listen to 1/2 of it, but I don't find it relaxing, inspiring, energizing or engaging."
"Satin Doll at its best! <SEP> Bill Chase plays a wonderfully musical and tasteful trumpet solo and without taking a breath leads the trumpets up to the ""screech notes""."
ok but disappointed <SEP> There is some good info BUT She keeps telling to look at the directions and info in the book that comes with the cd. but since this is a download you can't refer to the pamplet so you aren't given full info on the cd. Not worth the money i paid for it because of that.
ACTS!! <SEP> These guys don't seem to disappoint at all!! Great new song to kick off their new album with a new singer
Nothing <SEP> Never got the song. Seems there is always a problem with downloads.
sounds nice <SEP> This is one of those songs with a really nice beat. The lyrics could be a lot better. This song in my opinion could be one of chief keef songs that really have to grow on you.
Two Stars <SEP> Not really a good song
"just not my style <SEP> not what I expected, just not my style"
Five Stars <SEP> I just Love the Bolton Brothers there music just touch your soul. Wish i could see them in concert
Great fidelity and singing! <SEP> Wow! Finally can get Mom and Dad's favorite bajans and play them anytime from nearly anywhere. Thanks for having this available for download and streaming! Great quality! Singing is spot on!
Five Stars <SEP> Medleys of great Dixieland tunes
"don't like <SEP> i'm not really crazy about this song, i bought it this weekend plays fine, but its not for me.  cool lyrics though."
Nah. <SEP> Don't like this one
Love song <SEP> I love this music and it speaks to my heart. I find it very wonderful to listen to positive music.
Not what I was expecting. Just a short piece ... <SEP> Not what I was expecting.  Just a short piece of the symphony; a little over two minutes and it ended in mid...
"SOULFUL! <SEP> Better live on ""Legends of Gospel"", but he's awesome(love his harmonica playing too)."
"MA Local Death Metal at it's Finest! <SEP> Hailing from Boston MA, your pain is endearing really outdid themselves by re-recording this EP with their more suitable vokillist. While every song is mighty, the stand out tracks for me are ""Reinstate Civilization"",""Dawn of the Apocalypse"" and the Final Track ""The Final Battle"". Expect great deep growls, crushing melodic riffs and solos. Their ""live"" playing is even better as everyone is very energetic on stage headbanging and interacting with the crowds the entire time. Don't miss out on this Amazing Band! >:| \m/"
"It's Free <SEP> What can I say, it was free.  Kids seemed to like it.  Songs were nice renditions of the old classics."
"Sweet Children Sing Carols <SEP> This sampler provides six songs with the children of The Countdown Kids singing. (The production errors from an earlier release have been corrected, and the music is described correctly.)

Two tracks on the sampler stand out, and are worth the download. In, ""Deck the Halls,"" the children are accompanied by a percussion ensemble (including bells), with very beautiful French horn accents. In, ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing,"" the children's voices blend well and are full of beautiful harmonies in a very up-beat version of the song. They are accompanied by a small band ensemble that may include piano, guitars, xylophone and a drum set. These pieces earn five stars.

I like two of the other songs included, too. ""Christ Was Born on Christmas Day"" is very short. The children's voices are accompanied by a percussion ensemble, including piano, xylophone, tambourine and a drum set. ""Silent Night"" has a string orchestra and piano accompaniment with nice harmonies. These pieces earn four stars.

""Away in a Manger,"" is a children's choir with piano accompaniment. Some of the children are ""over singing,"" and they just aren't staying together very well as a group. As far as a children's choir presentation, it's ok, but nothing special. It's what I would expect to hear at a normal elementary school assembly, not on a sampler presented for sale. )Except for the parents and other close friend or relatives.)

""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" is presented with 12 child soloist parts. Simply put, this song should not have been included in the sampler. With most children's choirs (with exceptions, of course), voices are usually at their best when the children sing together, quietly. (Being able to hear each other helps them to keep their own voices in tune.) I don't want to damage any one child's self-esteem, or to discourage a budding artist who is making mistakes while learning how to sing, so I'll just explain that some of the voices were nice and others were horrible. What is especially disappointing is that the (adult?) producers didn't work around the challenges inherent in working with children to overcome the weaknesses in this presentation. I've rated the song 2 stars instead of 1 star because some of the soloists were very good.

Overall, I like most of it, so I've rated the sampler four stars. If you're in the mood for light-hearted music, you'll probably enjoy it.  Since the sampler is free, I recommend downloading the collection, enjoying the songs you like, and deleting the ones you don't like."
Disappointed <SEP> Will not allow me to export into I Tunes on my computer. Do not like the idea of having to install an exclusive player for Amazon MP3's
Five Stars <SEP> Good vinyl Chubby Wise album. He was a great fiddler.
Five Stars <SEP> Very up lifting
"Not the Radio Edit, Not Clean version <SEP> This is NOT the ""clean"" radio version. They still say the F--- word. I wish there was a way to get your money back because this is useless to me."
"this is advertized as the radio version, and it still has the bad swear word in it! <SEP> I bought this thinking it was the one I could play at school for the kids. CANT! It is the same as the one that is marked as explicit!
Can I return this somehow?!!!
thanks."
"Wonderful album and band <SEP> This album was created by 3 boys, named Danny ,Ricky ,and Jose. They created the album in there house in Ohio(maybe I forgot) and you can watch there video diary like things on youtube (look up King The Kid ,first channel that pops up). This album ahs a pop punk taste to it. I is very similar to All Time Low and they have the charm in person that makes them very lovable. They recently release some new songs and I highly suggest you buy this album and give them a try."
"Uplifting <SEP> This song was a favorite of a recently deceased friend, so while playing it, it evoked emotions at a higher plane."
So So Good!!!!!!! <SEP> I am a big Williams Brothers fan.  My father played them alot while I was growing up.  Melvin's voice is the epitome of that good ol' down home gospel.  And this song is a great example of it.
"Canton Spirituals <SEP> The Canton Spirituals will always be a favorite group to listen too. I enjoy the music, lyrics as well as the praise and worship."
Love Apocalyptica! <SEP> This is one of my favorite bands and I wanted to hear their take on Christmas carols. This is awesome to listen to!
Five Stars <SEP> This song is amazing
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Good music! <SEP> Very good music in this DVD by various artists. You will definitely be having church when you listen to this. I loved it!
One Star <SEP> terrible
Four Stars <SEP> this song is great by melvin and harvey but it still fall short to sam cooke.
"Kids voices <SEP> It reminds me of when I was a child and singing in the Christmas plays, which is many years ago. The childrens voices are sweet and pure. Thank you for allowing me to use this song for my own use. Merry Christmas!"
Traditions & Harmony <SEP> One of the great southern gospel quartet's still around.  Wonderful Christian toe tapping music that can be enjoyed for years to come.
One Star <SEP> Guh
"If you want relevancy or quality... <SEP> ...don't download this drivel.

Cheap synth meanderings, soapbox-spoken word over trash-metal (yes, that's TRASH, not ""thrash""), and the appropriately-titled (just about the only appropriate thing about this ""album"") ""Why?""'s barfing into the microphone do not a worthwhile 22 minutes, let alone $8.91, $5, or even $2 make.

To the ""artist"": For everyone's sake, including your own, please keep ""Z3rocool"" as your gamertag, and ONLY your gamertag."
Five Stars <SEP> Great product!
"Not a disco fan <SEP> Don't care for it. Actually my 2 year old granddaughter bought it. She liked the picture, I guess."
Awesome Acappella Group! <SEP> Just awesome!  Heard them in person at Christmas!  Worth the purchase to add to your collection. Would like to get more!
"Beautifully nostalgic tune that is not played often enough <SEP> Beautifully nostalgic tune that is not played often enough, IMHO.  Jim, along with the entire group, offer virtuoso performances through his trademark 'composers' approach to soloing.  Melodic, sensitive and enchanting....just sayin'...If you are not familiar with this particular track,  I think you will be in for a treat!  Great players have a way of raising the bar for the entire ensemble and I find that 'snyergy' on full display here.  RIP Jim...."
"UB40 from Amazon <SEP> I love, love this song. It's one of my favorite UB40 songs. Was introduced to this group by my husband; he is a die-hard fan. If you love the strong beat of the music and clear lyrics; then I recommend this song."
One Star <SEP> Cant listen to this or any of the other ones i baught
Very Pretty Song <SEP> I love her style.... her sound is  like the woman youd love to hear sing a love  song to you.
One Star <SEP> not as good as the movie version
Attention <SEP> Not original artists.
Five Stars <SEP> as expected
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song by an Awesome band!!
"Great song, grating remix <SEP> The aggro, meth-fueled bridge section ruins whats otherwise one of the sweetest, most gorgeous pop songs I've heard this year. The two other remixes (Bimbo Jones Vocal, Jacob Plant Dubstep) blow this one out of the water."
The Best! <SEP> Yo-Yo-Ma is just so perfect you know you get good music with his name on it! Then you put Bach with it and you have a winning buy. Cello was a forgotten instrument but helps bring the deep tones in balance. Love it!
Wow..both mixes are amazing!! <SEP> Absolutely spectacular job on track selection and flawless tight mixing.  Reminiscent of some of the best work from Above & Beyond.  Max Graham is back!!
scam this is not the whole song <SEP> iwasted my it was not a full song it was only a sentence not s song where is the song
Serious chill out music..... <SEP> When you want to Netflix and chill........
"worst ever <SEP> Worst album I have ever purchase , all songs are done by other singers  not original and if I could give it back I would."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Great Duet! <SEP> This remake of a secular song into a Gospel song is a beautiful tribute to God. Juanita Bynum and The Williams Brothers did an excellent job!
Two Stars <SEP> Won't upload on Photostory 3 even though it says its am MP3 file.
"Freestyle done right <SEP> I'd recommend this song to those who enjoy Freestyle, but want something fresh. Sharyn does not compromise when it comes to quality, and this song shows it. The edits, the effects, the singing, all very well done. If there was a DJ-friendly Flashback mix, I would have given this 5/5."
"Four Stars <SEP> This song has ""Class"""
"WACKKKKKK!!! <SEP> I was listening to the original version on Pandora and clicked ""buy now"" well it sent me this instead of what I was listening to."
Come Home---Barbara Lewis <SEP> This was a hard to find song because of it's age---It was the original version(Makes it even better!)There has been another version of the song which wasn't quite the same ---Recorded quality on original was very good!
"Two Stars <SEP> Although Ms Norman is an exquisite Wagnerian soprano, her voice is much to heavy for this song."
Sing it Jessye <SEP> nobody sings this song like she does - and this version of the melody is by far my favorite especially at Christmas
Five Stars <SEP> i like
"Music for the heart <SEP> A treasure of beautifully arranged and selected music that will delight any listener, at any age. Spanish music is A LANGUAGE ALL ITS OWN that speaks of true love, and never disappoints the listener. Weather you speak Spanish or not, these selections included in the compilation of this CD, need no translating, just listen, and enjoy."
I like this version by The French Pop Band this song ... <SEP> I like this version by The French Pop Band this song is also on quite a few French Pop albums
One Star <SEP> I thought the book with pictures and lyrics inside of cd was coming too.
Poor Very poor quality <SEP> Poor  Very poor quality
One Star <SEP> bought by mistake
"What A Silly and Forgettable Album! <SEP> Los Heroes Del Silencio is a Spanish band whose heavy melodic sound is similar to a lot of ""heavy"" American bands such as KISS, but without the theatrics. make up, and largely, without hits or even good songs. HDS is very much image and hype, beyond their sound. in this album, a 2 record set if you wish to pursue that particular avenue of audio, the album begins with the standard creaky noises, ""random"" guitar tuning and chords, then to kick start the album to a decent rocker song ""Nuestros Nombres"" - reminiscent of KISS' ""The Oath"", but then the album going downhill from there musically speaking. The album is well recorded and the CD booklet a tantalizing thing to behold, promising through its images and typeface, an album speaking or sounding of decadence, of mystery, and of something really cool, deep, dark and creepy.... but it disappoints right after the first track. At least ""(Music) From The Elder"" had some good songs in it despite the silliness of the pseudo storyline. This album has no point, no clear sense of identity beyond the image they sold you, and the songs are quite forgettable and disposable. There are metal and other sorts of guitar driven albums that on the first or second listen, hook you for life. Not this record, not by a mile. This one is only good for 1 track, maybe 2 at best, but then runs out of steam. Being the pride of Spain, this band from Zaragoza reached millions in their native Spain, Germany, and maybe a few other non-English speaking nations who actually took them seriously. You cannot help but laugh and guffaw through some of their lyrics, as they try really hard to be Iron Maiden, and fail to be even Winger. But you don't have to take my word for it: Take the fact that their next album (Avalancha) in which they were by that time, grasping at straws before they broke up; Enrique Bunbury, the lead singer, and face of the band - and the only one that could more or less fake an English name - went solo to an equally unremarkable career. In Avalancha this band turned Nazi (Iberia Submergida), this time trying to be Skrewdriver, but without their worldwide success. It is indeed fortunate that they disbanded as their next project was to be GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, complete with GG's sharing of his most intimate produce. if you still doubt my words, then how to explain the boatloads of used CDs of this title selling for under $2 on Amazon while a new copy sells for almost 10 times that amount? Market forces, the Invisible Hand allocates surplus items to where they are most needed. Apparently there are boatloads of people who bought this album at retail prices and found it to be beyond silly and ridiculous, but bordering on fraud. Buy only for under $2- and remember that $4 are added for shipping. Still overpriced for what it is."
"Diamond in the rough <SEP> An amazing release.
I've been so happy to hear this music, and all the other stuff that Hughie's family has given us.  Thank you!
Raw Sundown music is priceless. As you listen you hear how the music started. The tracks with no vocals, well, knock a few back and have an Outlaws karaoke party.
Pick this up and the others that have been released. Rough diamonds."
"Great Demo Cd <SEP> Great sounding demo cd.  I know that there are other record companies hawking some or all of these songs on quasi-legal or bootleg cds, but you've gotta get this stuff from HET.  They do by far the best job of cleaning up these vintage recordings and presenting a professional sound and product.  Highly recommend this cd!"
awesome cd <SEP> AWESOME CD FROM THE GUITAR ARMY OF FLORIDA. DEMOS ARE SO AWESOME IN THAT YOU GET THE ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BAND AND HOW THEY INTENDED IT TO SOUND.YOU WILL DEFINETLY ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I HAVE
Four Stars <SEP> great
a great version <SEP> very impressive!
"BEAUTIFUL song! <SEP> When I saw the movie, I knew I wanted to add this song to my ""Les Misrables"" playlist. It's such a beautiful, intimate moment between Valjean and the young Cosette. When I listened to this for the first time, it brought back all the emotion of that scene in the movie, and I almost cried. You can even hear the carriage at the beginning of the song! I think this song was a great addition to the movie, and I highly recommend it."
"Absolutely awful. The MP3 Downloads had no fidelity, ... <SEP> Absolutely awful.  The MP3 Downloads had no fidelity, no depth, and were flat on playback.  Would never do a download again"
"I hate old people! <SEP> I'm ""old"" and this is probably my very favorite  from Joan... I can so identify with with Joan's frustrated scenario describing the senior woman in front of her pulling out a  checkbook to use at the register in an Express Lane!  LOL"
Awful! <SEP> All instrumental! Thought collection would include vocal sound track!! Very disappointed. Have deleted the entire purchase & feel stupid for making purchase.
"Amazing new insight into traditional Christmas songs <SEP> When I saw the title list for this long awaited offering by John McDermott, I confess to being a little dubious that he could breathe new life into these beloved carols. Yet again, his spiritual depth and God-given musicianship has given me a fresh and uplifting re-introduction to songs that are traditional for all the best reasons. Highly recommended."
One Star <SEP> Short
"Crowe's performance is excellent <SEP> I'm auditioning for the role of Javert in a local production of the musical, and bought this track to prepare for the audition.

I love this performance of this song better than any I have heard, including the one on the so-called ""dream cast"" CD. I love the husky, gritty way Russell sings this...it's much easier to believe he is Javert, rather than just an actor playing a role.

Please don't listen to people who say he can't sing...I think he does a fantastic job in this role; listen to the sample and decide for yourself!"
The master returns <SEP> It's a shame Colm was a little too...seasoned to take the lead in the movie.  It was good to see him included as the Bishop and no surpirse he did a great job with this piece.
Too choppie... <SEP> I would rather listen to an entire performance rather than the edited version that this is. It was very chopped up.
Eddie Redmayne has a wonderful voice <SEP> I love Eddie Redmayne's voice. This song tells the story of Marius preparing for battle even while finding himself falling in love with Cosette.
"Love it <SEP> Fantastic track, best experienced on a decent system/headphones.  Let's support artists who made amazing music for us to enjoy.  Thanks!"
"as usual, it disappeared from my library <SEP> as usual, it disappeared from my library"
Five Stars <SEP> Great music by a great artist
Love this song. <SEP> I love to listen to Hugh Jackman as Valjean.  I think his emotion and talent are well matched to portray the difficulty of Valjean's situation.
"Was this transcribed to another key? <SEP> I have heard Hugh Jackman sing and he is very good, so it isn't like, ""Ooh Wolverine actually sang that?!?""

Rather, I felt he started off WAY TO HIGHLY PITCHED, (from every version I had previously heard, anyway.) It didn't have a good build (dynamic structure that is.)

As there are several dissapointing tracks on this album, I tend to think it is the Musical Director's fault that these songs were improperly showcased.

Especially the TEAR-JERKING Bring Him Home! Instead of reaching for a tissue, I was lurching for the refund button!"
"Bring Him Homs <SEP> This song is one of my favorites from both the movie and the musical. It really shows the plea of a father's heart, and right there you can tell that Cosette is going to end up with Marius and it just makes me happy."
"Breathtaking <SEP> The epilogue always makes me cry. Especially the part where they all stand together in (French) heaven, singing their song of liberty!
Yes. Just....YES!"
"I love this version... <SEP> I know Mr. Crowe has taken some flak for his singing voice, but I can't imagine why. I love the passion he puts into this piece, and I think it's both completely appropriate for the character, and musically valid and enjoyable. Other versions I've heard have been too ""singy"" and put on."
"Sad version of a Les Miz classic <SEP> Oh Mr. Crowe.  An actors actor for sure, but an acting SINGER he is not.  It sounds like a bad local middle school version of the song."
Five Stars <SEP> great song
"Two Stars <SEP> I didn't realize this was live, so half the song is instrumentals, talking, and crowd cheering."
"The Final Battle - The Music of Les Mis <SEP> I am a dyed in the wool Les Mis groupie. I have seen the pop opera on stage more than once and was ""hooked"" the first time. Of course the original story by Victor Hugo is compelling and captures the audience immediately but it is the music that remains with the viewer. It is at once melodic and powerful and, most importantly, very moving. It conveys perfectly the emotions of the characters in the story. In this movie rendition, the voices and orchestration are perfect."
Great Box! <SEP> Great Box!
Great track <SEP> Only found one song that I liked out of this entire album. Glad I could buy only the stuff I liked.
good choice <SEP> Needed upbeat xmas tune to choreograph a dance piece ... totally fits the bill
One Star <SEP> Terrible.
"Absolutely awful. The MP3 Downloads had no fidelity, ... <SEP> Absolutely awful.  The MP3 Downloads had no fidelity, no depth, and were flat on playback."
The quality is very poor. It also cuts out pddly at the end <SEP> The quality is very poor.  It also cuts out pddly at the end.
"Meh <SEP> Gets cut short right at the end, when it would switch to the next song on the full album."
"terrible compilation <SEP> Compared to other dubstep compilations I've heard this is terrible. I can tell there is a lot of amateur stuff in this album, in some songs the bass line doesn't even align with the melody...so odd."
"More hip hop than dubstep <SEP> A few songs are good, but the majority of the songs are a weird mix of rap and dubstep that is incredibly unappealing to me"
"Amazon MP3s for the fail again <SEP> Once again Ive wasted money on a terrible sounding MP3 album from Amazon.
The album itself isn't too bad, but Im giving it 1 star for the super poor quality audio that Amazon is becoming famous for. Audio quality is so bad that I cant even listen to it.
Sounds like it was remastered and whoever did it was obviously deaf. Theres no dynamics to the music...its all just overly compressed and poo like 90% of the music Ive gotten from Amazon. Sorry guys, but this will be the last money I waste on your poor MP3s until you get your audio issues sorted out."
Very bad <SEP> Dont buy this track. Very bad editing job on this. Few pieces are missing from the track.
One Star <SEP> I thought I was ordering thee ACDC.
One Star <SEP> I like the original better. Shouldn't have bought this.
Dang it! <SEP> The music is GREAT. I just wish there was some note about the profanity. Wanted to share the sound with young people but the embedded profanity prevents that. Just wish there was a heads up about it.
it better than anyother headphones besides beats I think its a tie with sony <SEP> Its cool.  I like it a lot rating should be a five rate it love and keep it.  I should tell u that the new ones you have to plug it in all the way.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
"Really excellent 'home grown' get down; feel good music!! <SEP> These guys are awesome. I think they're with/are Autumn and the Fall Guys, or something like this. I cannot believe how relaxing it makes you feel and the singers voice is very smooth. I just love these guys ~ I hope I can see them as I live in San Francisco! and believe they're down Santa Cruz or San Jose way ~ EXCELLENT choice. I just bought it! :)  TKS for reading.. Great playing and c'mon`feel good type..."
"Another Steve Wilson remix abomination <SEP> Steve Wilson ruins another one! His mixes are horrible. He takes the dynamics out of it and raised the levels of everything, If you listen to his music through out his career, he has no creativity or diversity. It all sounds the same. He does not hold the creative genius that Ian does. I have no idea why they let him ruin one of the greatest albums of all time along with other Tull and Crimson classics. I actually sold my copy and rebought the early remaster. Here is a warning to anyone, DO NOT buy a Steve Wilson remix! If you never heard the original, GET the original mix please. He should be selling cars at a lot, not involving himself with great music."
"Two Stars <SEP> It is ONE song, not eight."
Five Stars <SEP> Makes you wanna get freaky
"and these songs are from the best. <SEP> It doesn't matter if you're a veteran or not, if you're a true American this music will stir your soul. There's just not many things that can beat a military band....and these songs are from the best."
One Star <SEP> Too noisy not enough Salerosa
One Star <SEP> thank you
"Incompetent Piracy <SEP> These songs are by June Christy (all of them unless a couple are by Chris Connor), NOT Anita O'Day. I would give zero stars if I could."
"Okay <SEP> This is a pretty sweet song. Haven't heard Massive Attack before, so I decided to buy this song to try them out. I like what I hear!"
"A Badass Album <SEP> This is a badass album. I'd highly recommend you check this album out to see for yourself. Buy it, listen to it, and enjoy it."
"Beautiful! <SEP> Mark Hildreth is an extremely talented singer- we're in dire need of people like him to ensure there is still quality in the music industry. It's a sound that brings me back to the nineties a little- you know that sound that is as difficult to describe as it is to find these days!
Love you Sten! Er... I mean Mark! :)"
"SNOOP'S SMOKING TOO MANY PRIMOS <SEP> first of all snoop's not bob marley, and he's making wack azz reggae music very wack snoop needs to stick to rapping plus he changes more religions than madonna he was a muslim mlast year but hey anything for 4 a dollar he didn't have to become a rasta to justify his drug use we all know he's a crackhead."
"The Click Five's first album has become one of my favorite albums of all time(and I love everyone from Avril ... <SEP> I just dicovered that this cd existed a few weeks ago... The Click Five's first album has become one of my favorite albums of all time(and I love everyone from Avril to Dream Theater to Van Halen to Steve Vai). I was so excited to get this album... I bought it without even hearing a single track off the album.

Now that I have it, I wish I had listened to the album first. With the Click Five's first cd, every song was fantastic... maybe one filler song on the album. This album is the exact opposite. It sounds like all filler and maybe one or two decent songs. ""Wherever You Are"" is great!

Really disappointed... it's a shame too because I love Eric's voice. Such fantastic range, emotion and power.

Pass this album and get the first Click Five cd... absolutely fantastic."
Great song! <SEP> Used for our dance recital.  Great song!
Good Song <SEP> Liked it so I got it.
Great track! <SEP> I have to force myself to stop listening to this track sometimes so I don't get tired of it ;)
Cheesy <SEP> Cheesy sound bites from his radio show placed over some good music.  get rid of the sound bites and you might have something good here
"Sweet voice <SEP> I have no idea of what the words are in this song, but like the singer's voice and the overall sound of the piece."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"Love, love love! <SEP> I've never heard of Luis Bacalov, but ""Django"" is a deep, melodic, and ballad-like song all at once. Very enriching tune towards the film!"
Awesome!!!!!!!!! <SEP> I love this song! Its amazing and everyone I know loves it. I could listen to this all day long everyday.
"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY <SEP> Please, please do NOT waste your time with this cd.  What university puts out a cd of their marching band and fails to include its Fight Song or Alma Mater???!!!  Jacksonville State did!  As a result this could be ANY marching band recorded here.  On top of that the acoustics are lousy.  What a complete waste of my money."
"Not 4 Me <SEP> Right at the beginning a nice throat full of phlegm.  Yeah... eww... and... I noticed...

Also, listened to these for several days straight..  Nothing happened.  I think hypnosis stuff should be done in person, or perhaps some folks just don't get hypnotized.  Either way, it didn't work for me but that's not saying it wouldn't work for you."
"horrible! don't buy <SEP> This really upset me. First off the sound quality is terrible.  You can hear the feedback or something (example: the buzz sound that happens when you touch the aux cord to a sound system). The guys voice is not convincing, relaxing, hypnotic, or anything you will expect from the title. The script he reads is ok, herd better."
Not a hypnosis tape at all <SEP> I have used hypnosis tapes in the past to quit smoking.  I thought I would try it for weight loss.  Usually they talk you into a deeply relaxed state and you do go under if you are open to the experience.  This is not hypnosis.  It is more like a series of pep talks if anything.  Very sorry I purchased it.
"When shopping do not buy this recording <SEP> the whole shopping thing--just because I gained some weight doesn't mean I live by myself--couldn't get beyond that part the MP3 sucked so badly.

I wish Amazon would grab a bit from the middle of these inductions instead of the ""do not drive while listening to this recording while driving"" warning so you could get a feel for how competent the hypnotist is."
"Carelessly Issued Album With Mostly Partial Performances <SEP> One Media Publications has carelessly issued 4 albums which have much duplication, incorrect song titles and partial performances (fading a performance out after about a minute and quarter or a minute and a half). The 2 most glaring mistakes are That Lonesome Old Song mistitled as What About You and The Lonesome River mistitled as Water Rolls High. If you can get past all this, the performances are excellent and the interview is interesting. Ralph Stanley Featuring Ricky Skaggs & Keith Whitley features 10 complete performances. Man Of Constant Music (The Dave Cash Collection) features 9 complete performances & 7 partial performances (in some cases duplicates). The Greatest Ralph Stanley (Live) features 4 complete performances and 9 partial performances. Ralph Stanley Featuring Marty Stuart features zero complete performances and 10 partial performances."
"Good but not his best. <SEP> Rusty Wright and the band have exhibited pure talent and creativity through their music. Rusty is a true guitar virtuoso and his wife brings true soul to the music with her direct voice. My only regret is that this CD, although good, does not have that creative spark the others do. I am a fan but this was lacking the freshness that the band is very capable of."
Sound quality is indicative of the the days prior to ... <SEP> Sound quality is indicative of the the days prior to high fidelity. Why you Googling my name? Get a life!!
Two Stars <SEP> Close to the stones but not quite there
"Fantastic album, but digital copy is very incomplete. <SEP> Let me preface the review with this note: The rating applies to the Amazon mp3 version of the album ONLY.

The album itself is fantastic. Until buying this album (and the IA/01 -BIRTH- MD album), I had only heard of a few IA songs and there are a number that are well worth checking out.

So, since I like having all of my foreign songs be labeled in both, the native tongue and English, I went to the wiki to look up the album information....and discovered (unfortunately, after purchase) that there's a pretty massive issue. The digital copy of the album is missing nearly two-thirds of the tracks, only containing sixteen of the forty-five. I did a bit of research, this is not a case of having two variants, the way the IA/01 album was; the songs are actually missing.

In case anyone is curious, here is the list comparing the digital album to the physical:
-Tracks 1, 2, and 3 on the album are tracks 1, 2, and 3 on CD 1.
-Track 4 is the 5th track on the CD.
-Track 5 is track 6 on the CD, except about two and a half times as long.
-Tracks 6, 7, and 8 are tracks 7, 8, and 9 (respectively) from CD 1.
-Tracks 9 and 10 are tracks 13 and 14 from CD 1.
-Tracks 11 and 12 are tracks 1 and 2 from CD 2.
-Tracks 13 and 14 are tracks 4 and 5 from CD 2.
-Tracks 15 and 16 are tracks 8 and 9 on CD 2."
Five Stars <SEP> Best of his talent. Never will there be a voice like his.
"One Star <SEP> She sounds different, the song is too slow, IRS not how I remembered it."
CHILDREN <SEP> I do not want this thank you so much but my children took my kindle fire and tried to download a munch of stuff.  I did not approve of this order but I would like to thank you so much for sending this over to me so now I know just what they have been up to.  I try to let them take turns on the kindle so I don't know which one of them did the ordering of this but I am not interested in it at this time.
Two Stars <SEP> I didn't like it because the music didn't fit the song!
Great music to go with story <SEP> This music is great and if you have read the story the songs go right along with the story.  MY daughter really likes the book and was thrilled to see the music for it. She loves to listen to it. There are good messages for teenagers and adults in the songs.
"One Star <SEP> Ordered it by mistake. Was looking for the Cat Stevens ""Trouble"""
Great Song <SEP> Another best song for hand dancing or as old school would say fast dancing. LOL
One Star <SEP> audio quality is poor
Sweet Sundays is Just That- music to listen to ona Sunday <SEP> I like this song.  Amazon Music has a pretty darn good collection of the smooth jazz we both like and agree with!
"great song <SEP> I listened to this song before I purchased it, and i am enjoying it a lot thanks for having individual tracks."
Soothing to the Soul <SEP> Beyond expectations Heathers voice and the lyrics touched my soul.
"Cheer Up with Sycamore! <SEP> Matt Rineer's Sycamore is a delight.  Using such an adjective for a singer/songwriter record may feel strange, as so many of these releases are either self-indulgent or bitter, but Rineer's second EP is as pleasant and enjoyable a record as one could hope. While none of the tracks strike such a brilliant cord as ""There Is a Love"" (found on Rineer's equally strong initial outing, Survive ), each song on the 4-track Sycamore adds to the total experience which demands your ear, if even the sound is in the background. It's the type of album that you'll overhear and think ""Huh. I like this.""

And I believe that this imminent yet nonaggressive call for attention is the greatest strength of Sycamore. Rineer sings of hope and unity, and I for one believe him when he does so. His personal affinity for finding the brighter side of life and rallying against the darkness is evidenced in not only his lyrics but his melodies, instrument choices, and compositions. Wherever he has found his hope, he shows himself to be a true believer.

This thematic consistency is coupled with a level of restraint, however, that keeps him from being didactic or overbearing. Never did I feel like his enthusiasm for life was thrust upon me, as if he were saying, ""get your act together and feel how I feel"". On the contrary, Rineer seems content to simply say ""I am."" without begging for your agreement or empathy. His music delights in its own steadfast innocence, regardless of the listener's perception or attitude.

Sycamore is refreshing, engaging and wholly worth purchasing. I foresee that the work of Matt Rineer will be of value to me in the years to come, for when heartache and disappointment inevitably appear during life's ebb and flow, I will not be able to help but smile, at least a little, when I turn on these tracks."
"Fantastic new songs! <SEP> 4 awesome new tracks from a great local artist!  I'm especially enjoying Glimmer of Hope.

 I like the upbeat direction his music has been taking since his release of Survive, and I'm looking forward, with anticipation, to a full  length album. (sometime soon?)"
Two Stars <SEP> alex olkin's RM is much better
"Music <SEP> I love his voice, and his passion. It was never clear weather he won or not, but he certainly won
my heart, he is awesome. You won't be wasting your money on any of his music."
"Disk was blank <SEP> I ordered the disk and there was no music, just 7 two second clips of static.  Ordered a replacement, same thing....."
Two Stars <SEP> Do not like all the voice instructions before getting to hypnosis part.
not happy <SEP> I would have expected more than 1 song for the price of $9. Not what I expected. Should have been told
gangnam style hyper dance mix <SEP> this mix was not what i thought.it is a cover of the original song .it is ok but not for me . i did  not see that in the description.
"My bad <SEP> First off, I should of done more research on what NMK's had released.  Second, I should of been suspicious of the lack of info the page contained.

This is not an album.  This is 1 bloody song for 10 bucks.  It would of helped if the page mentioned that this was one song, but I was going fast and assumed it was an album.  Learned my lesson."
"ABBA on 45 RPM <SEP> 'DANCING QUEEN'/'FERNANDO'  $200+ for TWO ABBA songs? This recording is a reissue on Atlantic's OLDIES Series. If you're determined to collect ABBA singles, they first appeared in the US on Atlantic's red label. Most were initially released with picture sleeves. This is a total waste of money!"
"Read the fine print! <SEP> This only contains 2 songs!
I feel ripped off, for the price I paid."
One Star <SEP> It was not what I expected!
"Ripoff <SEP> Will never purchase from this seller again, one song on the whole cd?? And not even the original artist. Disappointed to say the least."
"One Star <SEP> I thought I was getting a album, but only got the one song. My fault I guess."
"I thought that Home was the title of the album ... <SEP> I thought that Home was the title of the album, and feature song. I did not know that it was the ONLY song. It was way overpriced for one song, and I would not have bought it at all if I had known the cd contained one song."
One Star <SEP> Only one song on the CD
Once in a Lifetime <SEP> His technical skill is phenomenal. His range is fantastic. His sensitivity as a player is improving all the time. He is amazing.
"This is theft <SEP> A 1 song CD for $ 9.99, that's a shame. I'll never buy anything again fron Tate Stevens, even if it are real good songs."
"This has no tie to Tate Stevens; <SEP> This is a song recorded over ten years ago.  This is not associated with Tate Stevens, he has been notified and this is being addressed."
"It Sure looks Good on you <SEP> The one song was well down, but 9.99 for ONE song, I will think twice on his next CD! Who sets pricing?"
"Only one song on the cd <SEP> My wife watches X Factor and really liked Tate Stevens, checked Amazon, saw he had released a cd in Dec.,when she got it, the cd only has one song on it. You can download the song from Amazon for .89 cents, the cd's $10."
Great Manqabat BUT only 1 8 min track <SEP> The Manqabat is great. The CD is a RIP-OFF. There is only ONE EIGHT minute 34 sec track on the whole CD for $15.23 (inc tax and shipping).No where on Amazon site does it indicate there only 1 track on the CD. I think a better term is day light robbery.
crazy good stuff <SEP> This has been one of my favorite bands for the last few years and it's great to hear some new music. Can't wait for a new record!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
"I did and it sounds like my vinyl without the scratches <SEP> This eight minute version has completely different sound.
If you want to listen to the song you know, buy a version that is about three minutes and fifteen seconds.
I did and it sounds like my vinyl without the scratches."
I love it <SEP> This is the best record I have ever heard.  There are eleven more words required so here they are: wordddds.
They charge you but you never get the downlaod <SEP> Never got my download sucks
Five Stars <SEP> Great
WILL NOT BUY MUSIC FROM AMAZON AGAIN <SEP> Cant get this to my MP3 Player!!!!!!
"Metal and no Hip-Hop <SEP> I'm probably one of the biggest necro fans out there, and when I saw this album I thought it might be good, but I was wrong. All it sounds like to me is Necro screaming over metal tracks. There is no hip hop on this record at all."
Not the original recording (and not a good one). <SEP> Not the original recording (and not a good one).. The fact that this is not an original recording should be clearly stated!!!!!
"CD-R REALESE! BEWARE AND DO NOT BUY! <SEP> be careful, this cd-r won't play on your home system, its only playable on computer. duplicated cd-rs are not
guaranteed playing everywhere!"
"..not so sure.. <SEP> ..it said this was the single version, but I was there in 1967 when the song came out and had
the lp; I've never heard this mix before and frankly, find it inferior.."
Five Stars <SEP> love it
Two Stars <SEP> Most of the live songs did not come close to the old record version
Two Stars <SEP> Wasn't the version I was looking for but it an okay version.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song from the DISCO era.
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent traditional sound, .!!"
"One Star <SEP> Love this song, but this is only a clip.  Amazon owes me a refund."
"Awesomeness <SEP> These guys are awesome, very dark heavy industrial group! If you ever get chance try to go see them live."
Love this music <SEP> Love this music and her voice - perfect for therapeutic massage!
"it was a live version that was not as good as the one listed on Grooveshark--disappointed <SEP> This is NOT the version that I listened to on Grooveshark.  That site prompted me to purchase song by linking me to Amazon but when I purchased, it was a live version that was not as good as the one listed on Grooveshark--disappointed!"
Great music! <SEP> I love this sound.  Keep up the good work and I'll keep buying!
"Explosion of Modern Blues Meets Original American Blues <SEP> This 2012 release is excellent, great driving guitars with a Canned Heat feel to it at times. It feels like a swampy,delta blues meets back woods whisky still, get off my property or I'm gonna' whup ya kinda' style.

This Virginia based band is tight. ""The band pays homage to those who have inspired them such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, R.L. Burnside, and Hound Dog Taylor, The Bush League imbues traditional blues with a modern flair.""

The modern flair comes from the arrangements like on the song ""'59 Chevy"" which brings to mind the band Clutch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pure-Rock-Fury/dp/B000058BAX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pure Rock Fury</a>&nbsp;in both the vocals and guitar work.

The tune ""Mexico"" brings back memories of classic Savoy Brown&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lions-Share-Jack-the-Toad/dp/B000KLO6RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lions Share/Jack the Toad</a>, stripped down raw blues.

A shot of the song ""Penicillin"" again has a boogie based Canned Heat feel to it. You just can't stop the toes from tappin'. Spot-on guitar, simple but to the point.

""Death of Robert"" again reeks of the band Clutch, I love it !

I read....

""The soul filled voice of co-founder JohnJason ""Sleepy Eyed Jay"" Cecil is both sin and salvation while the guitar licks of Shane ""Chicago Slim"" Parch paint a picture of Mississippi shotgun houses against a backdrop of the Windy City skyline. The Bush League's rhythm section is anchored by co-founder Royce ""I Don't Need No Nickname"" Folks on bass and Debbie Flood on drums.""

Sleepy and Slim are right on. Keep the great music coming guys. I got to get me this one very soon."
"A new Christmas classic! <SEP> Beautiful vocals by Gloria Lynne, timeless lyrics and music. Just like putting on a pair of my favorite cozy slippers. I truly love this song!"
"Perfect Love Song for a Wedding <SEP> I heard this song on Sirius one morning, and knew I had to have this in my collection. I sent the song to my son, who is getting married in July. He and his fiancee' loved it as well, and will incorporate the song into their wedding ceremony. Perfect love song for a wedding! Love, Bunny"
"Worth hearing for the interpretation regardless of the sketchy sound. <SEP> Yes, the sound is not good, but how fascinating to hear George Szell's approach to this music. It's taut and bracing music making and anyone who loves this work will enjoy listening to this."
"Forget It <SEP> Very badly recorded, sound quality is terrible.  It should be archived as an historical document of Copland';s work, but not marketed as an example of his music."
"Great band! <SEP> We used to go see these guys all the time in Richmond, glad to see they've finally put out a CD! If you like rockin' blues, these guys are for you."
Would not recommend <SEP> I didn't enjoy the song very much because the singers were horrible and did not sound like the anime actors.
"CHRISTian rap? <SEP> Boy, if this was the best Christian rap had to offer, i would've left the moment i listened to these songs. How disappointing. Simply rapping without cursing about success, people telling him he couldn't make it, a couple different tracks just about ladies, and then about feelings. It's pretty sad that he can be in a genre that's supposed to be about our faith. Reference to Christ is VAGUE... at best.
I thank the Lord for the real believer artists like Lecrae, Trip, T.R.U.T.H, Sho Baraka, Json, Thi'sl, etc. who actually rap for Him (and against the worldly lifestyles this guy boasts about). Praying this guy reads the review for his sake, and ditches the stylish ego & the fame that seems to have overcome him and these lukewarm lyrics, to begin living with a real purpose for Christ"
"I love this song!! <SEP> This song makes me realize how blessed I really am. It's such a great song, and I recommend it to any one who thinks they are not being blessed by God!"
not impressed <SEP> Not like the original sound track. It is ok but I expected much better!
"Not As Well Done as Bocelli's French Duet <SEP> The idea of Buble and his childhood hero, Bing Crosby doing a duet together is cool, but it isn't very well executed. The duet isn't very cohesive, and Crosby's recording quality isn't up to par."
"NOT a good version <SEP> NOT a good version.  Extended Sax solo for no good reason.  vocals not nearly as good as Shorrock.  If you want a faithful rendition of this song, don't get this one."
"COOL  CHANGE  BY :  LITTLE. RIVER  BAND <SEP> COOL  CHANGE  :  GET'S  5 ,  STAR'S , FOR  THE  RE - REMASTERE'D  SOUND  QUALITY ,  BY  LITTLE , RIVER  BAND  AMAZON  MUSIC  REVIEWER ,"
"Lullaby for my baby <SEP> I sing this to my newborn baby, is a go-to song to calm her down.  Remembered the song from my childhood, on the Three Amigos movie, glad Amazon had it."
Five Stars <SEP> Just the song I needed.
"Wimpy voice, strong instrumentals <SEP> voice does not do justice to strong composiion"
"Song is amazing!! Song quality.... not so much. <SEP> Today was a day I had been waiting for, the day ""To Plant a Seed"" and ""Understanding What We've Grown To Be"" cost only 5 bucks per album!! I bought them and then listened to this song on Youtube to see if it was good enough for the 99 cents or wait till later. It is awesome! So i bought it. And I am sad to say it is at a MUCH worse quality than the songs on  the two albums I bought the same day.

I am playing the music through the Amazon Cloud Player and the song is at a much lower volume and does not sound as good even when I turn it up as the other songs do. This is sad to my heart. It really is a good song and if the quality is better from Itunes or another place I say buy it! But not from here. Changing the volume every time I want to this one song it not really acceptable.

If anyone else has had a better experience with this song downloaded from Amazon please comment so I can get it straightened out and give this song the rating it deserves."
"Not so good! <SEP> I'm so disappointed with The Learn Swedish. It is disappointing because it did not include the book it refers to, begins explaining individual letters in lessons 1 and 2 then lesson 3  immediately starts giving rapidly spoken Swedish sentences with no translations and no time to hear and repeat."
"Another White Christmas for Bing! <SEP> Listened to it, enjoyed it, but never received a copy in the mail. Also could not access from the computer. Just don't know what I paid for!................the material recorded is great however!"
"Michael Buble + Bing Crosby = Christmas Greatness <SEP> Love this song!  Michael continues in the vein of Natalie Cole dueting with Nat King Cole, Celine Dion with Frank Sinatra, etc.  It's neat that with technology, we can marry the singing of two great artists that were not contemporaries.  I will say that the whole video hologram stuff a la Tupac is creepy.  As long as we keep it to audio recordings, I think we are good!"
"Ruined a classic <SEP> I love Michael Buble.  I do not like this recording at all. Frankly, I don't want to pay for Mr. Buble's adventures in Karaoke. Bing Crosby's White Christmas is a classic and to pair the two voices on Bing's rendition ruins not only this wonderful song, but both Buble and Crosby's voices.  Some things should be left well enough alone and this is one of them."
Don't get it :( <SEP> Not what I expected and was not very satisfied with the music because it does not sound like the actors.
"This album title is flat out false advertising. <SEP> First and foremost: this is NOT the best of the flying burrito brothers.  It is not ""The best of"" any incarnation of FBB.

The first/classic/most famous incarnation of this band had nothing to do with this music.
The second incarnation didn't really have much to do with this music either.

This *IS* a collection of demos from the 1979-1980 era of songs that wound up on the early 80's releases by the Burrito Brothers.  If you don't know what I'm talking about then I assure you that this isn't for you.  If you do know what I'm talking about then I'll explain why it gets two stars instead of one:  The Hearts on the Line versions of some of these songs had the contributions of sole original members Sneaky Pete turned way down in the mix.  In many of these demo versions you can actually hear Sneaky's steel guitar soaring over the songs as you would be used to on any other FBB release.  This release is really only for those interested in the long and winding story of the band following Gram Parsons' dismissal 9 years prior to its recording.  It serves as the missing link between the rather tight touring lineup on Live In Tokyo and the pop country drivel on Hearts on the Line."
"NOT the best <SEP> I HAD to give it a star just to warn anyone that would buy this! This IS NOT the best of the FBB, google the wikipedia before you buy stuff like this!"
"Wow! Original Music for a VERY NICE change. <SEP> Wow, Tom hit it out of the park! I have followed him since the Kickstarter campaign and have not been disappointed. Beautifully written by a real artist, playing a real instrument!
Contrast this with some music industry manufactured personality that can barely hold a microphone, let alone play an instrument, howling through an AutoTune Box. The music industry has changed dramatically in the last decade for the better as far as independent artist's access to the public. As for the music we actually hear on the radio...not so much, since it is still controlled by big business.
  You won't be disappointed with this CD. Tom's music is what really needs to be on POP radio. Hopefully, more people can get the word out and get this music the recognition it so richly deserves."
"An excellent album, spread the word! <SEP> I've been following Tom on YouTube for quite a while now, ever since he uploaded ""Over You"" to his channel in 2008. Just picked up his album and man is it impressive. On My Way has a very soulful and down-to-Earth feel, from the tone to the content of the lyrics. I'd love to see the word get out about this guy, he's one of my favorite independent artists."
"Otaku neckbeard <SEP> Did you poop out that album cover and decided, yup, I'm going for it?! I always knew I needed a fat white neckbeard from Rhode Island (a.k.a. meth head and euro-trash central) to teach me the urban ways of life and hip hop as I merely live in a legit city with all the urban things. LOL!!"
"Sababa Scores a Hat Trick <SEP> Sababa's appropriately named album Shalosh (Hebrew for the number 3) is fantastic. Shalosh was funded through a Kickstarter campaign that demonstrates the power of crowdsourcing in bringing top notch music to the market.

The voices of Steve Brodsky, Scott Leader and Robbi Sherwin blend together flawlessly.  The understated music allows their vocals to soar.  This album of 12 original compositions for traditional prayers and songs are a welcome addition to the flourishing contemporary Jewish music scene.  The melodies bring a new life to the L'cha Dodi and the Priestly Blessing.  Their rendition of Gam Zeh Ya'avor (This Too Shall Pass) is a toe tapper.

All the songs in this album show off Sababa's virtuoso talents."
"Simply Put...Deep <SEP> This album is a standout piece of work and aptly named.  This music is not for muscling through a day of work, unless you work poolside at a trendy boutique hotel.  No, this music is better suited for the late evenings when the mind is still active but its time to decompress a bit.  Or even better yet, its best suited for the open ended chill of the weekend.

Although this a cohesive album music, French Telephone has a lot of tracks up his sleeve that achieve a deep vibe that always induces head nodding.  Although most of the tracks have an uptempo jazzy deep house feel, there are a couple of more downtempo joints that fit right in with the vibe. If you are a listener of One Track Mind with Kristi Lomax, Garth Trinidad, Anthony Valadez, Gilles Petersen, or Benji B, you need to have this in your digital crate, stat!"
"Beautiful. What more could you ask for <SEP> Powerful. Beautiful. What more could you ask for. And no, I am not Dr. Seuss"
"more please <SEP> I'm pretty much blown away every time I play a song from these shakti tribers. This cd takes you on a ride..It was creatively put together mixing both english and sanskrit words/mantras through rap, rock,& pop...It gets loud, but also catches you in a sweet place. You should see me on the stair master at the gym singing these songs. I'm on top of the world. I play them in my (yoga) classes and i have people busting out their iphones ""shazamming"" me to figure out who it is that's loving up the room. You can FEEL it. i initially gave Larisa all the credit for her eccentric personality and powerhouse voice, but the band is really good! They are each individually amazing. Listening live or on the radio; you're there. and something makes you believe. It's inspiring, raw, happy, transformational and FUN. makes me smile- that's for sure.
breathe love and rock on~"
"Fine music! <SEP> Fabulous little Christmas album.  I saw Demetrius on a Detroit Fox morning show when I was visiting the Detroit area a couple of weeks ago.  I tried hard to get the CD of his music, but it was sold out.  Still trying to locate it, but did the download.  made the holidays merry and bright!"
"TOO Beautiful <SEP> Beautiful beautiful rendition of this song.  Joy to the World really isn't one of my favorite Christmas songs ... UNTIL NOW!!!
The piano and David's voice and the unique arrangement is unutterably beautiful.  Well worth 99 cents !!!  I wish it were on an album cd so I could have it on disc.  Hope to get his Oh Come All Ye Faithful too ... as I've heard it and it is glorious also.  Thanks for a wonderful Christmas present to myself !!"
NO product <SEP> Paid my money and never got the down loads. Could not figure out the problem and no one to ask.
"A nice musical effort but I found myself wishing the song itself would pass <SEP> The tune and singing were musically constrained and became somewhat repetitious.  This would make a good camp song, but it's not a particularly moving or inspiring piece.  But I was expecting something more of Debbie Friedman quality, which might be an unfairly high standard by which to judge."
Great music <SEP> I love this song.
The music is great! But I didn't receive the music videos as ... <SEP> The music is great!  But I didn't receive the music videos as listed in the description?  Was there supposed to be a second disc?
Five Stars <SEP> Loved it!
Great artist - engaging album! <SEP> Saw Karissa at a show and immediately connected with her and her music.  She is a dynamic performer and her spunk translates to her album.  It has some fun songs and some reflective ones.  Highly recommend it.  Great buy!
"I am very disappointed. <SEP> The title is correct but the song is wrong it doesn't even close. Ask Moe Bandy he will prove it to you, that I am right . I am very disappointed."
"Best version of Wild Irish Rose <SEP> Love this song, it is the best version of Wild Irish Rose I have ever heard. I use it as a ringtone for my mom."
Five Stars <SEP> Good song!
"Great rendition to awesome praise song <SEP> My husband and I started exercising - with moves from the insanity workout. I had collected as many upbeat songs as I could find. Only this one and ""Whom Shall I Fear"" workout mix, was able to actually help in the momentum of the workout. I recommend this for working out or in the morning for worship to help get woken up."
Five Stars <SEP> great song!
"So powerful and Beautiful <SEP> Awesome album. We play this during relaxaton, worship, and also in our little one's room. Helps to relieve tension and helps to really find rest in God's presence. We first saw her performing live on Sid Ruth's program years ago and got her album then and now. Beautiful soaking experience."
"Not worth it <SEP> It is the songs with no re-working, no re-mixing no voice work no nothing. The entire thing is not worth the value. I wasted my money. I deleted the entire thing."
"30 tracks in an album titled ""Top 40?"" Uh, no. <SEP> First of all, the poor rating goes largely to the title issue. This is NOT 40 tracks, but 30. This is really deceptive, if not outright dishonest.

Sampling the tracks, there are a few good ones, but they aren't the versions you'd hear in any decent club. Many, if not most, are versions without the good bass,without the beat that makes them danceable. In other words, these versions aren't ""anthems"" that put butts on the dance floor.

And many of the tracks are far more obscure and just not all that good.

Finally, any collection that includes Gnagham Style"" deserves zero stars and should go straight to the garbage bin of inexplicably trendy but lame and insipid music history."
"A truly inspiring and transformative voice! <SEP> Julie True doesn't sing... she is simply an instrument that is available to the ruach Elohim (breath) of God. ""Rain Down"" is obviously such a moment when the Creator of the Worlds chose to play a heavenly melody through Ms. True using her voice as one would a flute. In fact, listening isn't even required just soaking in the breath!"
Crazy good <SEP> No idea how I missed this album for so long... but its amazing. You'll love it. Spend some time daydreaming to appreciate it.
"Disappointed, cannot export from Amazon Music and get the ... <SEP> Disappointed, cannot export from Amazon Music and get the tune to play in Windows Media Player. Keep getting a notice that ""local music"" (whatever that means?)  from Amazon Music will not play in WMP."
Not for me at all... <SEP> I really do not enjoy this album at all and have not been able to make myself use it.  I couldn't run through it even once. If I could return it I would.  I so wasted my money. In the end I am listening to secular music.
Two Stars <SEP> same beat
Five Stars <SEP> Great music!
It's not so great <SEP> Music was more techno than anything.  If you like techno then this is for you. If not then just pass.
Great Music <SEP> Love listening to his music.  Very relaxing.
"Beautiful music! <SEP> I first heard TONE's music in Hawaii. The Sound of the Sea (I think that's what its called) was playing on loudspeakers during a festival held at the Byodo-In Temple. The music paired so beautifully with the beauty of the temple grounds  that I sat there for the whole song mesmerised and feeling so at peace. I had to ask a lot of people but finally found the music was provided by a TONE cd from the gift shop. I do not regret the purchase, the music is wonderful."
"I used these music for my alternative healing office and definitely my patients love to listen to them <SEP> It's amazingly relaxing when listening to it.  I used these music for my alternative healing office and definitely my patients love to listen to them.
Http://www.tang-dragon.com"
Tone <SEP> I received the CD in a very short time. The CD is in excellent condition and the music is superior. I would recommend ordering product from this site to all my friends.
"loved it! <SEP> Great for lovers of any kind of music. Wonderful music, vocals and lyrics. I'm giving it as gifts to all my friends.
Check it out!!!"
Plea for Jesus to hear our prayers <SEP> A beautiful hymn expressing love for God's only begotten Son and pleading with Him to always hear our humble prayers.
Terrible <SEP> My inner circle agrees that this is the musical equivalent to diarrhea.
"This is a hot CD to have!!!! <SEP> This is a nice Smooth jazz CD to have!!!!  It seems to be a tribute to the late Wayman Tisdale because the ""mellowness"" (I made that word up!!!) of this CD is transcendent of his style.  These brothers are grovin' on this CD, and if you are in to Smooth Jazz and the Wayman Tisdale sound, you will really enjoy it!!!"
"good, but... <SEP> Paige Anderson & the fearless kin definitely have room to grow as songwriters, the songs don't feel seamless and the lyrics seem forced at times, otherwise its pretty good, I wish they were more musicians and artists cutting their teeth on tradition instead of superficial pop music"
"I picked this up at my local library and boy am I glad i did <SEP> On a whim, I picked this up at my local library and boy am I glad i did. Flat out, this cd is engaging from first track to last track. Pat is fantastic on guitar and his ragged voice fits perfectly.
If you are open to blues, this album will not disappoint."
Four Stars <SEP> good people to deal with thanks
It was a remix. It wasn't made clear. <SEP> It was a remix.  It wasn't made clear.
"Wild at Heart <SEP> Every artist I love that has been around for a long time has reinvented themselves in some way. There s a balance to it. I get a little annoyed when people reinvent themselves too much because there s a reason people fell in love with you in the first place, but I think it s important not to regurgitate the same stuff over and over again.

Jan Terri's familiar, established blend remains firmly intact, but there s a sense of renewal about it, too.  It s an achievement that comes from the artist's journey, and from her willingness to risk. Her latest recording uses fewer instruments each of them framed distinctly in the sound andJan delivers the lead vocal with a full-on attitude and emotion that's never been completely realized in previous recordings.

I embraced risk, noted Jan Terri. When you are pushing yourself to not go back to the same well, you're gonna come up with something different, or you ll find songs that are different. And that s what happened on this album.

In some ways, The Wild One also reaffirms the very beginnings of Jan Terri. The album focuses on deft songwriting and fresh uses of her talents.  In the end, the mix of her road experiences, songwriting and challenging outside songs adds a brightness to the album that s reflected in the Wild One"
"Vintage Prog Rock!! <SEP> It's been a while since I was this excited about any new artist, but give this album a listen and you'll understand why! It truely captures the glory days of progressive rock with a ""modern day"" feel. I really love the sound and feel of this guitarist. His acoustic parts are carefully composed and tasty, while the heavier parts have just the right amount of ""raunch"" to it. If you're a fan of Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd, or just good Rock and Roll music, I suggest you try this one on for size. Nice job guys. Can't wait for the follow up!!"
"Finally, some good prog. <SEP> With much of 'today's' prog attempting to be the 'next Dream Theater' or retro efforts ending up sounding like predictable derivatives of the masters, I found this body of work to be faithful to the spirit of the classics while being entirely original, and the cover of the Beatles' ""Taxman"" demonstrates a mastery of 'new prog' as well.  Well produced, the tracks burst to life while retaining the warmth of vintage analog.  A definite must have for any prog fan."
"naked truth <SEP> Would work well at Gitmo in place of waterboarding and other forms unusual info gathering tactics.  Goes to show that anyone can put a bar code on 'anything' with the assumption that it's worthy of publication.
This is like smearing Vaseline over a camera lens; no shimmer, color, or focus."
Yikes! <SEP> Who does this album actually appeal to? Is this a joke? I actually cannot tell.
"Ward is my new found Jazz artist! <SEP> Love this dude and his style. Sad to say just happened upon him so I have some catching up to do. Ward is smooth and doing Marvin Gaye who's one of my favs,so this is double pleasure!"
"no thanks... <SEP> No thanks. The only thing that kept me from giving this ""album"" a 1 star rating was that Amanda's voice is still just as sweet and clear as ever, but the level of the material she's singing and the band is playing is several steps in quality below what I've come to expect from Kenny & Amanda Smith. Not only are the songs not up to snuff on quality, I'd only characterize 4 or 5 of them as actual bluegrass tunes, and that's probably stretching the definition a bit. Most of this collection is pleasant, syrupy folk-style stuff with guitar accompaniment. Pleasant, yes, but it's also utterly forgettable. If this is the direction Kenny and Amanda are heading with their music, then I won't be buying any more of it. Oh well...looks like another great bluegrass group has succumbed to the lure of ""going mainstream"" and ruined their sound."
"Catch me if I try <SEP> I chose the 5 star rating because the entire album is so perfectly put together it is unreal.  The songs are upbeat and provide a message.  Nothing is down hearted or dragging.  The group plays quietly and emphatically to backup the singing of Amanda.  I have this album on everything I own and have played it almost continuously.  I am a flats and Scruggs fan and play them mostly.  This album had taken over and is the best album I have heard from start to finish.  Dan Healy, Titusville Florida"
Andre Ward is someone to follow! <SEP> Andre is one of our favorite contemporary jazz artists.  He has a unique style to his jazz and yet I still feel that he has more to offer!  I am excitedly awaiting his next project.
"FLASHPOINT...SMOOTH <SEP> After watching this at first on CBS and then on Ion on Thursdays and Sundays, I really like the theme.  The mix is an extended remix and Bhatia and Posner don't disappoint.  Too bad the whole score isn't available. A+."
One Star <SEP> Not the original artist.
"The acoustic cover we deserve <SEP> Great cover and great quality. No DRM bulls*** with itunes. Look forward to future covers, good luck and Hwaiting dawg."
"do not waste of your money <SEP> Just Musics without songs not much Christmas mood, similar style of all album, do not waste of your money."
"not for kids actually <SEP> What kind of ""kids"" music has songs dropping lightly edited f-bombs
Otherwise some of the covers are great but why market it to kids?"
"OH YES! <SEP> My bro sang in this, man! This is one GREAT SONG!!!!! I love this one, it's on my mp3 player, and I will listen to it EVERY DAY!!!!! :)"
Good toons! <SEP> I like the sound of this group.
"Kick-Ass Rock and Roll <SEP> This group sounds better live. But, with this on my MP3 while cycling my chopper.....I think I go too fast"
"Chuck Johnson is as good as it gets! <SEP> We've been big fans of the Barb Wire album and finally check this earlier one out. So glad we did, this is great stuff. The only thing better than Chuck's songwriting is his vocals! We're lucky to live in the Charlotte area and get to see Chuck Johnson and the Charlyhorse band locally, He never disappoints."
"A local Americana treasure <SEP> Chuck is a singer songwriter from the Charlotte, NC area who can hold his own with the best. I started to give it five stars, but that is reserved for extremely rare and special instances. I plan on getting his first release ""Cotton Ain't King"", based on the strength of ""Snake Box on The Altar"". I can't wait to see what he comes up with next."
"Spitz can't be beat <SEP> Mikazuki Rock was released in 2002 with 13 songs, the band's first for new label Universal Music Japan. The opening song on this album, ""Yoru no kagetekuru"", basically shows how Spitz is roughly-speaking the Coldplay of Japan, but much... much... much... better. It's probably their best album-opener. ""Mizu iro no matchi"" is a charming pop song that my wife has asked me to learn how to play, it's good. ""Mekans no thema"" is a good, rockin' song with nice riffs and a driving pace. ""Babaroa"" is another Coldplay-like slow-burner with cool basslines, haunting vocal sounds, and a bit of an electronic feel to it. ""Low Tech Romantica"" is a ho-hum so-so rocker, but it's followed by another burner, ""Hanemono,"" which starts off sedately before building up into one of Spitz's most infectious rockers - this is another fun song to play on the guitar. That's followed by the sweet ""Umi wo Mi ni iko"", which is all about going to the beach, also one of their better songs. ""Escargot"" starts off with bland-ish riffs, but improves greatly with a rollicking chorus. ""Kaede"" and ""Gabera"" are both smooth, sweet tunes, and the album-closers are relatively straight-forward numbers and somewhat unmemorable."
"Couldn't get it downloaded <SEP> It probably would have been fine if I could have gotten it downloaded.  I went back to try to see what the problem was, but can't find it to download it the second time, so I think I paid for nothing."
Five Stars <SEP> enjoyed his music since 1964
Beware! <SEP> These are not the original songs. They are nothing more than poor quality re-recorded versions of the original songs. These are not authentic!
Five Stars <SEP> Purchased the music to be legal for my Christmas Light Show
"Down With The Sickness [Explicit]  - Richard Cheese <SEP> I once saw Richard Cheese live and in person, and enjoyed his music a great deal.  Not so much with this MP3."
"cheesy yeah <SEP> Never really understood what a luft balloon is.  I know it's German and the rock band Nena is German.  Okay the internet's awesome.  During a Rolling Stones concert in West Berlin in 1982, the guitar player for Nena noticed balloons being released and thought it would be stunning, given the balloons were changing shape and shifting around, if they floated over the Berlin Wall to the Soviet sector since they apparently looked like spacecrafts.  That is interesting... and weird!  This Richard Cheese version is a lounge-y soft version suitable for Frank Sinatra fans.  Not nearly as good as Nena's new wave version.  I can't even believe the song's available for purchase on amazon as a single choice."
song very short <SEP> this mp3 is less than 30 seconds long and only features 5 seconds of the actual song. It should not be available for download.
One Star <SEP> This is Lame compared to the original.
Two Stars <SEP> This is a cover version....not the original.
"excellent Electro/Dance Music <SEP> ,.excellent Electro/Dance Music,..."
"it really is his world <SEP> ""sonic 06"" may have been a glitchy game but the songs are great, currently one of the best songs on my playlist and one of my favorites"
"Neil Sedaka-Live at the Royal Albert Hall CD purchase from Amazon.com <SEP> Love Neil Sedaka.  Have many wonderful memories listening to his singing. This CD has a great sound, clear and in perfect condition.  Would purchase more is found."
Christmas <SEP> Good!
"Dubstepish EDM <SEP> I was initially skeptical about the whole dubstep endeavour, however, eventually I started to hear artists who would use the effects and interesting rhythms of the genre to actually arrange the sound in a way interesting to a listener rather than a random assortment of beeps and click.  Overwerk is one such artist.  This is the best dubstep I've heard ever, although take that with a grain of salt since I don't like most other dubsep.  If you like Deadmau5, you should check this artist out.  Daybreak is the best track on the album."
Poor app <SEP> I bought it but could not download it. I ended up buying another version.
One Night in Bangkok <SEP> These songs are NOT by the original artists. Some of the samples sounded like they were so I bought this. Very disappointed.
Two Stars <SEP> not the version i was looking for
BEWARE THIS IS A REMIX & NOT ORIGINAL SONG! <SEP> BEWARE! This is REMIX and not the original.  VERY MISLEADING & VERY DISHONEST!
"Not OG <SEP> Not a very good version, seems to be you can't find the original on Amazon anywhere."
Two Stars <SEP> This is not the original version.  It should be marked as such.
"Contrary to what the title has been set to, ... <SEP> Contrary to what the title has been set to, this is NOT the 7 minute, 9 second Coldcut Remix of Eric B. and Rakim's ""Paid in Full"". Somebody uploaded the four minute version and either mistyped the song title or intentionally labeled the song the wrong way to defraud consumers. I have a right mind to report this issue, but will see in the next few days if the issue resolves itself.  -Brian"
"the other was horrible. <SEP> Only one CD was worth it, the other was horrible."
Happy Camper! <SEP> I love the cd.. I'm enjoying it.. I really love her and music. . I love all of the songs.. Amazing cd..
"Jenni Rivera is awesome !! <SEP> I was not a Jenni Rivera fan I did know one or two songs and sadly I didn't discover her music till she passed, but now I am a big fan I love the way she sings puts passion in her songs makes you feel the pain , joy and heartbreak . I definitely have all her songs in my iPod only wished I could have seen her perform in concert. Her music and legacy will live on what a wonderful performer and human being she was helping so many people and inspiring women to not let things shake you down to get back up and be a fighter a survivor.  Definitely recommend all her CDs her music is wonderful makes me even prouder to be Mexican !!"
"Missing the Voice <SEP> Seems to me this recording is more about the background than the voice. While I like the dance and the up beats of the song, I would love to have been able to hear her words better. Good song to use clips for other media promotions."
What were they thinking <SEP> This is without a doubt the worst version of this song that I have ever heard - and I have 8 others. The relentless uptempo completely destroys the original meaning of the song.  Other than Dylan's original I suggest buying Tom Corwin and Tim Hockenberry or The Band or Joen Baez.  Jerry Jeff Walker does a passabe job but avoid this beast completely.
Should not be for sell on here... <SEP> This is in no way music or comedy or anything ANYBODY should pay money for. I have no idea why Amazon has it listed for sale it's just a guy with a bad accent talking about people.
Great song to replace my worn out record <SEP> Love Brook Benton needed this to complete my Brook CD
One Star <SEP> Not the original version.
Never heard of him either!!!!! ... <SEP> Never  heard  of  him  either!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The song sucks and it's way overplayed. <SEP> The song sucks and it's way overplayed.
The best music I ever heard doesn't get airplay you have to find it.
Taylor swift isn't one of them."
Never got it <SEP> I was totally unable to download this or any other song I purchased from play music so that I could move it from one of my devices to the other. I made several attempts to resolve it but no joy there either.
Five Stars <SEP> the wife loved it
"The King is Back!!! <SEP> Finally Ramon Ayala y Los Bravos del Norte are back. This CD is really good, I really enjoyed listening to it. This is his first CD in the United States in a little over 8yrs. Pick it up, highly recommended."
O Tay <SEP> O Tay
Five Stars <SEP> Love Jeff hardy and love this album!
jd <SEP> i love it l like francesca battistelli she has a beautiful voice . . . . . . . .
"Limitless Sound Track <SEP> Went to fast...sucked...wanted complete sound track....this is stupid...why would pay this much for less than complete sound track
If I had known this I would never had bought it..."
Disappointment <SEP> I thought this would have lyrics or at least sound like the theme from Gundam Wing. Unfortunately it is a fake and not even the song at all.
One Star <SEP> Wish more than one song.
Not Good for producers <SEP> The vocals don't flow with the tempo listed on the tracks.
"Good for digital sampling! <SEP> I've used these vocals in dance music tracks that I've released.  Great quality, and the price is right!"
One Star <SEP> Not the version from the movie. No lyric cover.
Love it <SEP> This is my family. Had to support. They always make good music. Be on the lookout for the Threat Boyzz
Lame. <SEP> They ruined the song by putting an add or something in the middle of it. Lame.
WHAT?!??!?!?  DO NOT PURCHASE <SEP> Really??!!  The girl does a PLUG within the song PLUS it cuts off at the end???  How do I get a refund for this?  I know it's only a buck or so BUT I don't like having the wool pulled over my eyes!  ESPECIALLY being a GOOD Amazon customer!!!
"Beware <SEP> It's not the original version of the song.  At about 1:40 there's a woman saying ""A Night to Remember with Tony Okumbowa and Jo Jo Flores!"" inserted in the track."
"Unfair <SEP> Was so disappointed to download this version with the drop ""a night to remember"" ruining a song I dearly wanted to enjoy I guess I should've researched more instead of shazam'n this spam!"
DANCE WITH YOU (45 single) - Carrie Lucas: WARNING ... <SEP> DANCE WITH YOU (45 single) - Carrie Lucas:  WARNING: The ending of this record has been abruptly cut off (original single has fadeout). DO  NOT PURCHASE until mp3 file has been replaced with complete version of the original single.
"Bold and Unafraid! <SEP> Artist Derek VanScoten, starts out boldly with a few bars that are repeated over and over again for the first One Third of Patrol.

THANKFULLY, that first third eventually ends with Mr. VanScoten mixing thing up a bit with a completely different set of notes that he is unafraid to repeat over and over again during the second third of the song.

Then VanScoten ties everything up in a neat bow in the last third of the Patrol, by choosing to repeat a wholly new set of bars, unlike the first two, over and over again until the music finally, mercifully, ends.

With this album, Derek VanScoten has proven, he is unafraid to reject popular ideas of how music should sound, and has created a ""Must Miss"" that will surely never allow any virtual dust to ever settle under my digital copy of his work.

And don't worry. If this review, like my last one of Patrol, does not show up, *I* am unafraid to post it over and over and over again. People need to be warned."
Off the Chain <SEP> These pranks help get me through som eof my difficult days at work.  It is also a time when I can laugh for a few minutes after an intense meeting or prior to geting ready for one.
"Kid's Music <SEP> I love Symphony of Science, but where that is rich with lofty prose by some of our greatest thinkers for people of all ages, Terra Lumina by comparison feels like rather uninspired lyrics for children.  Whereas I could listen to ""Children of Africa"" (Symphony of Science) over and over again, I've heard ""Shifting Light"" once and I don't ever need to hear it again.  Science is amazing, it is bold, it is awe inspiring, and yet this work feels positively meek--there just isn't a sense of wonder here--instead there are preachy and condescending lyrics.  ""It's good to have many questions about the world that you face.""  ""Any creature you can see needs water just like you and me.""  Thanks Daddy.

The science in the album is a little weak as well, although it must be challenging to create a musical piece that actually explains an important scientific concept.  In some places the vocals seem to simply be an unnuanced list of scientific terms without any context.  For instance it's hard to imaging creating a song about the doppler shift without ever explaining how waves are compressed when their source approaches and stretched out when their source recedes.  Just mentioning that light can ""red shift"" doesn't explain what red shift is.

The music is competently put together, much of it sounds folksy and acoustic.  It isn't bad (it's hard to appreciate it with the lyrics) but it is neither catchy nor memorable.  I won't be humming it later. :-(

This is all disappointing to me because I love so much of the author's other work.  I'm not unhappy that I purchased this album because I am gladto contribute to melodysheep for all the wonderful works he's produced in the past.  But I wasn't expecting a children's record.

If you love science and you have small children (ages 4-8), you definitely should consider purchasing this album for them to enjoy.  If you love science and you love melodysheep, purchase this album to help him out, but it's probably not going to end up on your MP3 player.

Hope to see more work from melodysheep in the future.  Something a little more mature, perhaps."
"Worst quality, didn't download 2 of the 4, terrible meditation <SEP> That's about all except that I will call about not getting the downloads on two of them.  Hopefully, I can get my money back.

Don't waste your money or time with these meditations since the two I had were awful."
Mochipet: not sure why I like this guy. <SEP> Maybe teh title is just too clever. The music has a tight feel to it as well. He seems inspired by something just not sure what.
"Probably, the most important song with respect to inspiring ... <SEP> Probably, the most important song with respect to inspiring The Rolling Stones was the song ""Rolling Stone"", which is where they got their name.  Where is that song?"
Five Stars <SEP> AWESOME!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love
Seemed pretty stale. <SEP> Not at all interesting or engaging.  Seemed pretty stale.
Get ready to laugh <SEP> This was a really really funny prank call.  I laugh so hard I almost lost my breath.  The guy who was prank was a really good guy.
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song.......
"Great for Long Haul Driving <SEP> This helps pass the lonely evening hours when I'm making that long drive home from Fort Bragg to my home back in Georgia.  Always leaves me laughing.

Not the complete song <SEP> the song was missing an entire verse. I wish they would've let me listen to it before I bought . It's unusable
Off the Chain <SEP> This one is top favorite because you will almost wet your pants laughing at him. I just love this one and play it alot while driving home.
"$38.95 !! <SEP> Way too expensive for a single CD, even with the 4 bonus songs. I returned it for 3 CD's, which cost less."
Christmas with committed <SEP> Great CD  Good work as always gentleman.  The harmonies and arrangements are awesome.  I especially like the Go Tell it on the Mountain rendition.  A wonderful holiday gift.  Keep producing awesome music !!1
Best Album Ever <SEP> this was the s*** never have heard anything like this original and sick has everything you need in this album
"Good Re-Mix <SEP> This is a great tune!  I didn't realize when I downloaded it, that it's actually not the original with Will. I.Am and Britney, but a remix...yes I see it clearly says remix, but somehow I missed it.  LOL  It wasn't until my husband listened to it and told, that I realized my mistake.  Nonetheless, I still enjoy this tune.  It has a great beat."
This is not a radio mix!  I hate it and want my money back <SEP> On Amazon MP3 - all you see is radio mix - you do not see that it is explicit.  Only after buying do you realize it has every swear word maintainabile - I want my money back
"Just not what I expect of Berlin nor Karajan <SEP> I was just looking for a second movement taken at a slightly faster tempo than the recording that I have, and I thought, ""Can't go wrong with Berlin and Karajan; even a bad recording will at least be competent.""

I was wrong. SO wrong. It almost sounds as though they were sight-reading the movement and the mics were set up by the local hobbyist AV club. Really, I'm a HUGE fan of Karajan's work and of course the Berlin Phil is spectacular, but there are points when players crack notes, the orchestra is not at all together and the balances are bizarre.

It is energetic though..."
One Star <SEP> It did not work.
"when I'm gone <SEP> Like the beat and the vocals, nice reinvention of a bluegrass song. The video for it is really neat too."
"One Star <SEP> Very short, song cut off after 38 sec.  Very unhappy with it."
"+1/2 - Sophomore slump from mid-70s pop makers <SEP> The DeFranco Family - a family act from Ontario, Canada - had several hits and a terrific run in `70s teen magazines. The fuss was centered on the super-cute Tony DeFranco, whose 13-year-old voice was complemented by his brothers' and sisters' harmony vocals, yielding a sound akin to the Partridge Family fronted by Donny Osmond. What made the records work were lyrics that Tony could croon convincingly to pre-teen girls, bubblegum hooks and sophisticated arrangements by writer/producer Walt Meskell. The group's second (and final) album features their third (and final) hit, a cover of the Drifters' ""Save the Last Dance for Me."" It's the best track on the album, though Tony's slightly funky take on Dr. John's ""Poor Boy"" isn't bad. Tony's voice still sounds fresh and young, but the arrangements are heavier, and the sweet bubblegum sounds were exchanged for MOR ballads and overcooked Vegas-styled horn-rock. There's very little here that stacks up to the hooks of ""Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat"" and ""Abra-Ca-Dabra."" Even the love letter to Tony's pre-teen fans, ""I Guess You Already Knew,"" hasn't the craft of similar sentiments on the debut; apparently the DeFranco's producer/songwriters had only one album of top-notch material. If you're new to the DeFranco's catalog, start with their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heartbeat-It-s-a-Lovebeat/dp/B003G27QH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat</a>, and come back to this when need to complete your connection with Tony.

One Star <SEP> Im not able to hear the full song
Crawfish are jumpin <SEP> The home of the true south
Don't waste your money!!! <SEP> Absolutely the lowest quality digital reproduction. It is filled with scratches and pops and sounds like a monaural cassette recording through a microphone from an old vinyl recording. Don't waste your money
One Star <SEP> Very poor audio.
"Poor quality <SEP> The quality of each song is terrible!  Wanted to use it as background for sing along and/or individual singers, and find it impossible to use.  Am disappointed that I ordered the entire album."
Beautiful and relaxing <SEP> Her voice is beautiful and the music is so relaxing.  I like to listen to it at night or just have it on in the background while I am working.
Five Stars <SEP> Nice sound quality.
"Good 15 minute free-form meditation <SEP> There's no guiding here, no voice at all. Just 15 minutes of slow Tibetan bowl. Sounds great on Kindle Fire. Excellent choice for meditators who want something without music and much structure. Very calming. The pace is very good, so it slows you down, even if you have a racing mind. No music except the bowl tones."
"Wrong Band  , <SEP> Do not know this song . I WAS TRYING TO ORDER THIS SONG  BUY THE SONG BY (HEART)  Cathy P."
Ugh.... <SEP> Not what I wanted!  Nothing else to say!  Not what I expected or wanted!!  I was looking for something different.  Sorry...
... of the few Heifetz recordings that I have not liked. He shows his a striking lack of finesse ... <SEP> This is one of the few Heifetz recordings that I have not liked. He shows his a striking lack of finesse and is playing.
One Star <SEP> It never downloaded to my phone
"but it is really pretty and uplifting <SEP> A different kind of song for Lou Bega, but it is really pretty and uplifting. I always feel good after listening to it."
badddd <SEP> Awesome old style blues
"MY JAMM!!!! <SEP> Awesome song! Downloaded when it came out. I listen to it daily. Love Shelby J , Anthony Hamilton and of course Prince. Waiting for your album ShelbyJ, #1 Fan"
Dont buy <SEP> Too much talking
Four Stars <SEP> Good Folk Rock Flavor!
"I really enjoyed this song <SEP> Even though I am not a Beatles fan, I really enjoyed this song. I heard it once and came home and bought the download. Not at all like what I think of a typical Beatles song. Love the bagpipes."
Worth every penny! <SEP> Definitely one of The Hitchcock's best albums. Strange music keeps releasing top quality products. Prozak is on top of his game here with the rap and rock fusion combined with his intelligent lyrics.
My kids and I love other Theocracy albums <SEP> Usually I am a fan of offbeat stories to get across an idea.  My kids and I love other Theocracy albums.  This song seemed inappropriately crass for no real purpose.
"I Wanted So Badly to Love This Record, and I Just Don't.... <SEP> When I first heard this album was coming, I was desperate to hear it. The idea of Enrico Rava making a large-ensemble recording (as far as I know, for the first time since Carla Bley's ""Escalator over the Hill,"" forty-odd years ago) was irresistible. And even more, the idea of his taking on Michael Jackson's gorgeously danceable music was just...wonderful. (And on ECM! How is it possible that anyone could have talked Manfred Eicher into that?) But the record just doesn't live up to that promise. The young musicians were clearly having a lot of fun, and the audience (this is a live recording) seem to be enjoying themselves tremendously, too. But somehow, for me at least, the pleasure just doesn't doesn't come through on the record. The arrangements seem perfunctory, most of the soloists are...nothing special, and even Rava seems to have dialed backed his virtuosity, perhaps to avoid showing up the others.

I've actually been reluctant to write this review, because I love Rava's music so much. This man is one of the most important musicians alive, and one of the most fun. I own perhaps two dozen of his recordings, and can recommend almost any of them unreservedly. But I'd hate to have anyone who's new to Rava's music start with this album, which is neither representative nor (in my opinion) very good. Better to start with almost any of his other recent ECM recordings, like ""Easy Living"" and ""Tribe,"" or (if you can find them) some of his more obscure titles, like ""Chanson"" with the French accordionist Richard Galliano or ""Quatre,"" with the amazing rhythm section of Miroslav Vitous and Daniel Humair, which is probably my personal favourite.

I really hope no one who reads this will be put off exploring Rava's music. He's great, truly great. But this album probably isn't the place to start."
"A rare misstep from Rava and ECM <SEP> This is truly a mediocre ensemble effort. The arrangements seem to echo one cliche after another. It is a strange mixture of old big band charts and bad disco background structures. It certainly suggests a giant step backward for ensemble jazz. The soloing is a slight relief from the pomp and repetition of the band. When I first listened, I couldn't believe that the arrangers had ever even heard Michael Jackson's music. It has more in common with the terrible soundtrack recordings from 70s youth exploitation films. I played it again today and couldn't make it through any of the tracks. It is rather surprising that the music of a seminal artist could inspire something so unlistenable. I give it one star for Rava who deserves better and one star for ECM who rarely disappoints on this scale."
Four Stars <SEP> ok
"I cannot say I like any of the remade songs <SEP> I am not sure why the could not use the original songs by the original bands. Unfortunately, I cannot say I like any of the remade songs. Pretty dissapointed."
"Empty Track. <SEP> I bought four of these ultra silent subliminal tracks, all from ""Personal Subliminal Messages Programs"", the other three are exactly what was promised. If I turn my volume and speakers up on high, there is indeed talking there. However on this track there is nothing. I also looked at this track in an audio program and zoomed in as far as the program would take me and to my sadness no noise frequency blips existed. Also re-downloading the track made no difference."
Don't BUY <SEP> This is just a ten or  15 second LOOP of the song - that's all.  This song should be removed.
look elsewhere for a electronic sub/remix. <SEP> Really? A 26 second sample? That's all this song is. It's a rip off and will be demanding a refund.
Two Stars <SEP> $.99 for the 30 second sample
rip off <SEP> This song is only like 25 seconds long. It is a waste of .99 don't waste your time or money.
It is only 26 seconds long. <SEP> It is only 26 seconds long!  Total rip off!  I really wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing.  = (
"Don't buy <SEP> This song was only 24 or so seconds long, if I knew, I wouldn't have purchased it. There was no way to get a refund."
"super short <SEP> Did not realize this was only 28 sec, but charged for a full length song. What is the point in that?"
Disappointed <SEP> I thought it would be a full song but it was only 26 seconds long and there was no way to determine that till after I paid for the download
The best song ever <SEP> I've been trying for years to get this song and Amazon made it possible. It's been truly impossible for me to get this and Amazon came through and the price was very reasonble for this download. Thank you your the best!
MP3 quality is HORRIBLE!!!!! <SEP> The quality is absolutely horrible!!!! It sounds like a BAD pirated version! It's only 89 cents but I STILL want my money back. That's how horrible it is!
Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic!!! Can't stop singing the songs!!!
Five Stars <SEP> A great 3 rd release by the talented Bill Ryan and his band.
"Cannot hear it. <SEP> It will not play so I have not heard it. I have tried everything, but it just sits there."
Save your $$$ <SEP> This gave me the worst headache. This girl cannot sing.
Trash <SEP> Artist bought the wav files as mashed them together (takes 5 minutes) then buys the license for the .wav files and attempts to sell the song that thousands of other artists now own.
Missing the main vocal music <SEP> There was this really cool vocal music which strangely enough it does not shown here ? Forget to use the APP.to identify the music when it was playing on the DVD. Grrrrrr. And the search goes on.
"BILL PHILLIPS - One of C&W's Greats <SEP> Search the web, and you cannot find high quality CD's of Bill Phillips... so the next best thing is to buy his vinyl (33's and 45's) and convert them to CD.  Bill Phillips' songs shouldn't get lost or forgotten with time.  He was one of the BEST!  Just a brilliant artist who many C&W fans have never heard."
"Love this bluegrass family band sound <SEP> Nice, solid recording. Very classic sound from Mueller family band. I can listen to this original over and over again!"
"exciting!!! <SEP> An exciting number which appeals to this bluegrass person.  Both Mark Murphy and Barry Mitterhoff  i know for their music over the  years of my living in NJ.  Barry normally likes to play classical oriented music so i am glad to hear him digress a little. Or is that progress? I do  believe, however, that this track is the best one on the album."
One Star <SEP> not what spected
One Star <SEP> Love it
"Gloria/Miami Sound Machine's around awhile but with this HIT, ""Hotel Naccional"", makes them#1 again! <SEP> I rated this product based solely on the fact that I couldn't find any extended versions because I love to dance. While I was shopping for another CD, I ran across DJ Michelangelo's disc offering me not one re-mix in addition to the original version, he has three more on it that blows your socks off!! Trustworthy, quality conscious!"
"A letdown <SEP> If you loved Warrior's Code, Meanest of Times and Blackout, you may not like this one.  Lots of meh songs on this album.  The elements are there, but the magic is gone IMO."
Five Stars <SEP> The greatest album of this band!
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
Keep your tradition <SEP> This was my grandfather's favorite March. He was a true Bavarian Original and I'm glad to have this song on my phone to listen to.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!!
She calls it their best album hands-down <SEP> Bought this album for my daughter and she's listened to it in full every day since. She calls it their best album hands-down. Thought-provoking yet danceable. She is also writing this review for me because I was nice enough to buy it for her :-)
Five Stars <SEP> The vinyl is clear so that's really cool. sounds good. would recommend!
I bought it to use it in a video and ... <SEP> I bought it to use it in a video and I was not allowed to. I wish I could get my money back. :(
One Star <SEP> Bought for a client
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
You suck at rap <SEP> Stick with your genre. You suck at rap.
"Boring <SEP> I loved Bailey's rendering of the Bach suites for unaccompanied cello so much that I was eager to hear him tackle Elgar.  I love the music but am spoiled by having listened to the Du Pre version so many times.  I listened in vain for any trace of the emotion and energy of that much earlier recording in this one.  It was really unsatisfying.
Then the Smetana section began and this recording managed to make that gorgeous bit music boring also.  I have a sneaking hunch it must have been whoever produced this disc who is responsible.  Hard to imagine such wonderful radiant music falling so flat, but it sure does, to my old jaded ears.
Buy the Du Pre version and ignore the primitive recording techniques.  Lord, if they could only re-master her work and release it in SACD!"
"great, heard it on movie track of The End ... <SEP> great, heard it on movie track of The End of the Affair with Fiennes, Moore and Reyes, was trying to purchase song as a single on cd though. this song was not from movie track but good."
Five Stars <SEP> Great.
Five Stars <SEP> A
Not made well Choppy <SEP> Not made well very choppy and jarring. The splicing of the thunder into the rain background seems to me to need better blending. NOT good for going to sleep to.
Five Stars <SEP> Good old school music
"Absolute mis-purchase - the song is chopped and lengthened and just terribly butchered - yuck <SEP> Don't get this version! Absolute mis-purchase - the song is chopped and lengthened and just terribly butchered - yuck! Love the song, but will have to download different version somewhere else."
Should have been a silent day that it was recorded. <SEP> It sounds like a few hours planning to meet a deadline.  I would really like Ronan Parke to record some traditional Christmas carols .
Cute song <SEP> The kids love this episode of Daniel Tiger and the song is a good reminder when having a play date to share the toys.
"Five Stars <SEP> Everything was perfect. Pack7ng, arrival on time, great music. Very pleased."
Not the same as the video - no intro <SEP> This does not have the ssss aaaa fffff. Etc at the beginning .  If you want the intro go with the non-bonus track version
"Stellar debut! <SEP> Superb musicianship and fresh and innovative arrangements of timeless jazz standards combine to yield listening perfection.  The CD's in heavy rotation on my system--as music to work to, cook to, and as a brilliant soundtrack for entertaining.  It's about time the Verve Jazz Ensemble hit the studio--and came to my attention!  Hopefully little time will pass before Verve's sophomore release."
Wedding song <SEP> This is a beautiful mother son dance. The words are beautiful and touching
Old school r&b <SEP> Semi-classic
Five Stars <SEP> loved it
Five Stars <SEP> Kids  love  it
Five Stars <SEP> Our granddaughter loves it!!
Five Stars <SEP> A true 80s classic
"you'll surely enjoy this debut release from NY's Infinite Spectrum <SEP> This is such a strong and solid progressive metal album... Very heavily influenced by the likes of Dream Theater and Symphony X with an additional dose of the band's own unique style. if you're a fan of prog, you'll surely enjoy this debut release from NY's Infinite Spectrum. Get it!"
CLASSIC EASY LISTENING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC AT ITS VERY BEST. <SEP> Excellent cover from Lex DeAzevedo  i highly recommend this artist and all artists on the surrey house music collection as they were originally recorded only for radio airplay on easy listening/ beautiful radio stations thru the 80s and 90s and were finally released a few years ago. If you been wanting this music and heard it on the radio back in the day then now is time to get in on it YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID.
"An Exhilarating Journey..Hop on the Allison Burnside Express <SEP> Two great artists from two great musical families. Bernard and Cedric have been around the block and back again. This 2013 release is lightening hot. From the blues/rock genre of music, this is the first collaboration between the two artists and hopefully not the last.

""Bernard Allison (guitar, vocals) is the son of Luther Allison (1939-1997), who was famous for his rocking take on the blues, a style he originally honed backing up masters like Freddie King and Otis Rush; Cedric Burnside (guitar, vocals, drums) is the grandson of R. L. Burnside (1926-2005), whose extremely raw sound was influenced by John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins and Muddy Waters.""

Besides a batch of fresh original songs, the band interprets Ike & Tina Turner's ""Nutbush City Limits,"" the classic ""Going Down"" by Don Nix as well as Willie Dixon's ""Hidden Charms.""

Besides Bernard Allison and Cedric Burnside, the band features...

Trenton Ayers..guitar
Erick Ballard..drums
Vic Jackson..bass

They will also be on board this high-speed train as it rolls through a roughly 90-minute set that focuses on material from the new album, as well as some additional songs by the Cedric Burnside Project.

You can hear the past influences in the music, not only from the masters but also from their own solo projects, North Mississippi Allstars, and a touch of funk and Cajun thrown in for good measure.

There is not one weak song out of the 11 tunes. Great collaboration guys."
One Star <SEP> horrible
Fantasic rendition <SEP> Absolute favorite rendition of this classic
"Josh nails it! <SEP> This is by far the best rendition of ""The Christmas Song"" I have ever heard. Josh has a God-given talent. I've followed his work since he joined Mountain Heart and I have always been impressed. I even got him to sing on my CD! If you like good music, you will LOVE this!

"Save your ears and last meal <SEP> Hated it, was not what I was buying. Thought it was R-Real song remixed. I truly regret this purchase. Wish I could give a negative number"
"Great stuff! <SEP> Looking forward to more stuff from Vika.
She's really a brilliant pianist. Fun listening to her versions of metal."
One Star <SEP> I never received my download
Thanks Lone Ninja! <SEP> Thank you brother for putting out a dope album that does not have a single N-word on any of the tracks.  Lyrics are thoughtful and creative.  Beats tight as always.
"Very nice! <SEP> Very Vintage, love the riffs in the tunes! ;) Currently in the studio making a new record, stay tuned!! Eric from Positronic"
"One Star <SEP> Very poor quality, lots of background noise."
"original version is much better <SEP> I chose the remix and regretted it.  The original version recorded by the artist is much better.  The short audio preview clip provided by amazon didn't play long enough to indicate enough difference between the remix and the original, so I bought the remix.  Once I received the whole song I realized the original is better."
"Boring, downloaded wrong version... <SEP> I was looking for the version they play on Area/SiriusXM... this is not the version.. I would not recommend this."
Four Stars <SEP> Brings back good old memories
Love this mellow cover! <SEP> Amazing cover.  Great music!
"The right artist can turn a song around! <SEP> Not crazy about the original Faster Pussycat version, but this shows how an artist can turn a song around and make you hear it again for the first time.  Great cover by The White Buffalo.  Heartbreaking and moving.  I was singing it to myself for days afterwards."
One Star <SEP> to fast does not sound like a christmas song
best relaxing cd i have ever had <SEP> it took a long time to find this cd but it was worth it! I suggest this cd to anybody who thinking about buying it
This is a fantastic album and best on a good or great set ... <SEP> This is a fantastic album and best on a good or great set of headphones!  Or a good stereo system. But the running order of the songs is wrong. Look to the original 1989 cassette release for proper reference. The album flows much better.
I simply hate it. <SEP> I can't stand listening to a single Minecraft song. Probably just because my brother is always singing them and it is getting really annoying.
Enjoyable Elvis Music <SEP> This is a collection of many of the beautiful love songs that Elvis made popular during his career.  A good mix that is very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to.
"Not the best value for your money. <SEP> This is one song burned on to CD-R.  The $9.99 price would imply that it's a whole album, but to be clear, it is one, single, solitary song.  A great song!  But just one."
No vocals! Deceiving album cover. This is a ... <SEP> No vocals! Deceiving album cover. This is a cover SOUNDTRACK version of the main theme I See You by Leona Lewis. Can't return once bought.
Classic material <SEP> AZ always delivers good music my opinion he is the most uderated rappers out there he still keeps it real
"Why is this guy virtually unknown? <SEP> William Topley is a top shelf songwriter with a instantly recognizable soulful voice and a great band. It is really hard to put him in to any genre, other to say it's rootsy stuff. At bluesy, folky, a little r&b. Check out his back catalog as well. Magnolia, Sycamore St., and few others are classics."
Poorly recorded. <SEP> This was recorded at a very high volume level. I had to spend an additional .99 to get a decent recording.
"Gross <SEP> Terrible album. Just god awful. Leave the electronica to Moby, Dido."
"Seller is shady scammer. Wouldn't purchase. <SEP> I wouldn't buy this ""song"". Not that funny first of all. Secondly it only supports a fake scammer. Fake youtube subs as well as fake Twitch streams. He's so boring that nobody wants to watch his youtube let alone his live Twitch streams. Which is why he has to use viewbots to get fake viewers so he's at the top of the stream list and lure unsuspecting viewers into his lame stream. Of course most leave. Probably why he isn't partnered yet.

The only review on here for this is from himself, J. Modica. Which is why the only review on Major Drip: 2D Platformer is from the same J. Modica. Because he is the dev of the game as well. His usual scam is to viewbot his twitch streams and then spam a ""giveaway"", but only if you download his game. Why? Because he makes money off the ad revenue for every person downloading that game. Which isn't many since the game sucks as well. Hence the twitch viewbotting giveaway scam."
"As expected.. <SEP> Another great song from RED. A ""Perfect Life"" is essentially a deceptive mindset, a fallacy someone lives not acknowledging what's horrible wrong.
I can hardly wait for 2.5.13 when they release their newest album."
"very fine ! <SEP> A Dutch jazzman with a very loveley, by times strong, practically allways lyrical and also nicely personal approach.
We have been in their concert yesterday. A fantastic concert !
The band has the souplesse of a snake-dancer.
A very gentle piano-player, bassplayer who is a typical dedicated working-plucker from the kind that seems to have a love-relation with the acoustic bass that makes the ladies sigh ""wish I was that bass"", nd, here it comes; an incredible young drummer..!
This Mr. Song is a talent that rises way above his generation. The guy has an easyness and relaxation in his moves while doing breathless-making things wich gives an uplift to the total of the band. His solo, done in ease, was allmost impossible in rythm/changes,subtleness, details and intuitive playing while being still in controle.. marvelous !
Ad Colen has this Sydney Bechet - kind of feel in his sound, but here and there the squeek and energy of Pharoah comes by and over all he is a good soloist nd a good space-maker for his fellow-musicians..
His somewhat shy-ness in the speaking introduction at the public-approach is disarming..
Think it was completely right that they were given a high rating in the Jazz-reviews here in Holland."
Five Stars <SEP> Good Vietnamese feeling and expression.
"For Completionists Only <SEP> Sadly, I must report, that this is the worst Ocean Colour Scene album by a country mile. I've bought every OCS album (studio, bestof, or live), nearly every single (including the 2CD singles), solo albums, dvds, attended many concerts, and purchased the T-shirts, and this is the only OCS purchase I've regretted.

It starts with six catchy, but forgettable tunes, with only ""If God Made Everyone"" having any lasting impact. Before it divebombs into the some of the worst lyrically and musically terrible songs the band has produced. Professor Perplexity is embarrassing, Mistaken Identity nonsensical. The last two songs are bland and would be b-sides on any other album.

The only truly good tracks are George's Tower, which is haunting but far too short, and The Union with it's excellent guitar riff and reminds me of Go To See Boys.

Perhaps the solo albums have taken their toll on the band as both SF and SC solo efforts are far superior to this album.

Sadly this album will go the way of On The Leyline and the Self Titled Album, pulled out only when I've overplayed everything else."
Prodigal for real <SEP> Grew up on Antonious. Sad to hear him cursing on this album. He is a prodigal for real. Pray for him.
"Disapointed <SEP> I was very disappointed but if you like their style, you might like this but I doubt it."
"Dissapointed <SEP> I wanted the original mix. Although it is in stereo, like the original album, what happened to the
piano bridge ?"
Five Stars <SEP> it's TITR - you love it already!
MAKE YOU MY EX <SEP> SEXY SONG!! IT HAS A OLD SCHOOL FEEL WITH A NEW SCHOOL VIBE!! IT REMINDS ME OF R. KELLY WHEN HE WAS WITH THE GROUP GUY.
Very Good Album <SEP> Just found him... Sounds very good ... Have to get acquainted  with his music.. But Enjoyed very much.... Great Voice
"AWESOME <SEP> Awesome, can't stop listening to it! Really like the full continuous tracks at the end of each CD, epic!"
AAAA <SEP> Happy to buy this album! is simply the BEST :D Armin Van Buuren is one of the BEST DJ and producers that ever exited in this planet!! trance music gives me peace and let me think in a better way!
Five Stars <SEP> kick ass
didn't care for this music. <SEP> didn't care for this music.
Happy upbeat children's music without the words <SEP> This was great for name that tune too.
bad <SEP> This is  not great at all. I wouldn't even give it one star really. It makes your ears squeal and makes me wish I had something to plug them with. I deleted this!
"Ooops <SEP> ordered wrong song, wish i could get rid of it but i paid for it. will read better next time"
Amazing Cover/Remix <SEP> Sick Individuals truly transform this song with their interpretation.  I came to know it because it was used for a Chanel fashion show and I had to track it down.
ok <SEP> ok
DO NOT BUY <SEP> The static you hear in the sample is also on the recording they are selling. Such a great singer but such a horrible recording. It should never have been sold. You are better off listening to this recording on YouTube. The sound quality is vastly better.
"Amazon Sucks <SEP> Good song, but I had to purchase it twice thanks to Amazon.  Guess it will be the last thing I purchase here for a while. Back to the far superior iTunes."
His eye is on the sparrow... <SEP> While this suggests that it (Feat. David Phelps And Reggie Smith) it DOES NOT.  It only features Lynda Randle with no David Phelps or Reggie Smith.
Five Stars <SEP> I'm liking this very much
"Nice... <SEP> I'm not a big Brandy's fan, but I love this song! I didn't choose to buy the full CD, but this song is hot!"
"awesome track, not so awesome album <SEP> Unfortunately this was my favorite track on the entire album, hopefully other people will like the rest of them.  I'm just very picky of the music I like."
"Dissapointing. <SEP> Most tracks are extremely simple, repetitive, and not Dubstep.

There are only a few decent tracks in the whole list."
"My Name is America <SEP> I am very patriotic.  Loved the words.  Todd has a beautiful voice and the music is great.  I would recommend this CD to
everyone who loves America."
liked it. <SEP> As old as I am I'm sure I've heard some of this before but could not remember. It was a wonderful addition to my xmas music.
Nice song <SEP> Nice song
Five Stars <SEP> Just a song I dl for my Amazon Prime Music
"Excellent Smooth Jazz Sound <SEP> Larry is a local Dallas Jazz musician who we heard at a local pub. He was so good, we hired him to play a house party. Everyone was amazed at how talented he was so we bought this CD and it is on our top playlist since."
"NOV 6 <SEP> Midnight Rambler is the Rolling Stones, particularly Mick and Keith, showing exactly how much they loved and were influenced by American blues. Both lyrically and musically, this song reflects the evolution of the blues from Mississippi to Chicago to across the pond...even if they did write this song in Positano, Italy.

It starts off like a train from the South, classic blues riff and lonesome harmonica, ready to embrace the city and the late night Chicago blues scene. Mick sings about a killer, the one you never seen before. You won't see him until it's too late. He prowls the streets at night, hunting for blood. At around 1:30 the tempo increases into a short verse that stresses the reality of the danger...Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show. This is seriously bad, you do not want to meet this guy. You need to be home, not out in the urban jungle.

The tempo really builds after 2:25, when the killer sees a potential victim and his heart beats faster with excitement. The slide guitar and harmonica ride along side by side, as Mick implores 'don't you do that' over and over, either his feeble conscience trying helplessly to get him to stop, or willing his victim not to go a certain way. At 3:57 he is getting ready to strike, waiting for the right moment. Time stands still. I love Keith's guitar from 4:07 - 4:26, this hold your breath section, walking the razor's edge. Mick at 4:27 - Well you heard about the Boston...(whomp!), It's not one of those...(whomp!). I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler You know, the one you never seen before.

The deed is done and the killer must temporarily confront his own horror and self-loathing before the music starts to pick up again at 6:10. His twisted braggadocio has won out and sends him striding off to ponder the next cycle. Don't try to catch him, for if you do...I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts!"
Great music <SEP> It's amazing and good for  when your cleaning  your car and just want something good to listen too.i live itl
Super Song!!! <SEP> N'dambi!!!! That's all I can say. This artist has been slept on. Her music is so classic and thought provoking. The instrumentation is out of this world. This song is really encouraging and everyone should get this!!!
... is a spoof of Psychedelic rock or just a bad knockoff of the Beatles <SEP> I just can't tell if this is a spoof of Psychedelic rock or just a bad knockoff of the Beatles. Either way it is a treasure and I enjoy it thoroughly. Wish they would re issue the CD or album with the original lenticular 3d cover...
"Gave up the funk! <SEP> ""Gave up the funk"" on this cover of the Funkadelic classic."

Five Stars <SEP> I love this song so much.
"The good news is Gwen isn't the worst part of this ... <SEP> Ugh. The good news is Gwen isn't the worst part of this bad version of a good song, so I don't have to feel bad about that."
"Just find it on youtube <SEP> They're such a power couple I wanted to hear this duet.  But it was no improvement, unlike the South Side combo of Moby and Gwen Stefani.  You watch the live video of the song on Youtube and then be done with it."
"AMAZON INSTALLATION IS STUPID <SEP> The song is great, was unable to download the system to my IPOD so I had to purchase it from another website after purchasing the song from amazon and downloading all amazon requirements that was not compatible to my IPOD."
Digital Downloads <SEP> I am having too much trouble using this public domain music on my blog.  Also can't find it anywhere to play it on my computer.  Downloaded a player and an installer and nothing is happening.  Such a huge waste of my time. Wasting a whole day of my life.
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorites in the 60's

"The CD/album music is good, but very repetitious though <SEP> The movie is a gem.  The CD/album music is good, but very repetitious though. Too much of the same.  I

"Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful family, the most incredable voices!!"
"Jumped all over the funk! <SEP> Smooth Jazz All Stars just ""jumped all over the funk"" on this one! I didn't know they had this in them."
Praise God! <SEP> Awesome song! Wonderful heart for God our Father!
Old scratched record <SEP> The music skips like an old scratched record. I want my money back.
"Lost Classic From 1975 <SEP> Great lost gem. This band produced 3 albums. While i'm not sure which i like best,the debut is very hard to find and well worth having in any serious collection.don't understand why the band never made it big?Great vocals,great guitar work,its a mystery...."
"greater if any old christian vinyl was reissued  more, hardly ever are <SEP> there are no reissues, and yet I never have even seen any of these folk psychedelic or hippie vinyl in the thrift stores ..why because I guess they are so good no one ever parts with them..meaning maybe they may be worth a reissue..just maybe? maybe the boring ones like ones they have at thrift stores don't have to be, but the ones no one ever parts with, yes should be because they are actually great?"
songs we forget <SEP> Was reminded of this great song after reading article. Great hit from the 90's. Had to purchase and remind friends.
"Dashed expectations <SEP> What a wonderful performance!

Too bad the selection stops about halfway into ""Wotan's Farewell.""  The first part sets up great expectations of the parting, which begins with ""Der Augen leuchtendes Paar.""  Alas, the selection was too literal, including only the section mostly saying, ""Farewell.""

The final insult to injury is that the next section, with the actual good-bye, is not available.

What a cruel, cruel joke to package such inspired singing and playing so poorly!"
"A great album that deserved better treatment! <SEP> I would love to ask the producers of the this reissue ""Just what the hell were you thinking?""
This is actually Augie Colon's classic second LP release ""Chant of the Jungle"".  Although why it was renamed is a mystery to me.

Most of you proabably already know that Augie was the percussionist for the late great Martin Denny. Denny produced both of Colon's two LP releases.

Now back to this reissue:
There really isn't much here to like other than the fact the music was reissued digitally.  But this release's audio quality is so bad, I wonder again ""What the hell were they thinking?""  The music is presented in stereo, which is a miracle, but the audio sounds like with recorded through a wall of cotton.  It is so muddy as to be ridiculous.  The original cover artwork has been replaced with something that looks like clip art from an Ibiza Remix CD.  Sad, just sad.

Ok so here is big question for all the producers out there:  Why would you reissue something and then change it and lower the quality form its original glory?  Why release it in the first place if you're going to do this to it?  Its like taking a classic old movie that was shot in color and changing the title and making it black and white."
Get your Irish on with these pipes and drums! <SEP> Perfect background music for a video containing pictures taken during a St. Patrick's Day Parade.
"I could not agree more. We all stand on the back of our parents/grand-parents <SEP> Ima, when are you releasing a sequel to this? I can't wait. Keep us in the loop. If you are a music lover, get this track and the previous CD.  Either will make a good Mother's Day present.

Five Stars <SEP> good
"Stilleto-healed boots and Eddie Lang? <SEP> Wow, that cover really says ""the 1920s"", doesn't it? I can't imagine that any care went in to the production of this album, if they put a 1990s stripper image on the cover. Stick to the Eddie Lang releases on the  JSP, Timeless, Yazoo and Retrieval record labels."
"Please do not buy. <SEP> THe Greeks don't sing they grunt!  I bought this because I love medeaval choir music and ancient hymns.  I actually lived in the Holy Land for nearly 3 years and toured the Church of the Holy Sepulchre many times.  Terribly dissapointing!

"... songs on one of the off-the-beaten-path radio stations and loved the originality <SEP> I heard one of their songs on one of the off-the-beaten-path radio stations and  loved the originality!  So, I had to purchase the album. Well, each song sounded the same unfortunately.  If you're into ""club"" sounding tracks, this is for you!"
~Misandry~ <SEP> This song speaks to me on a spiritual level you don't even know. Looking forward to their work in the future.
"Feeble form over meaning... <SEP> For the first opus of this adventure, one reviewer claimed: ""The quartets have previously been recorded by the Kronos, Arditti and Alban Berg quartets, but on this recording, Canada's Molinari Quartet puts its imprint on these works, being particularly successful at evoking the music's raw intimacy and wintry lyricism.""

Familiar with Schnittke's works, I recommended the following reference performances of the highest level:

The Borodine String Quartet for No. 1 and No. 3 - direct, unforced, meaningful-
Arditti for No. 2 - utter clarity derived from a meaningful reading-
Alban Berg for No. 4 -they are after all the dedicatee of the piece!-

Kronos for none of them.

As the volume 2 of Schnittke's chamber music is released by the same group, the shortcomings of their interpretations are now even more evident. Again, familiar with the works recorded in this second volume, the extracts provided on the label's page were sufficient to assess this new release.

Fortunately for us, the Borodine String Quartet recorded the Piano Quartet and the Piano Quintet back in 1991 on Virgin Classics. This reference version acutely exposes the difference between understanding an idiom and its meaning and simply staying on the surface, like missing the forest for a tree.

And what a miss! The pianistic drive is often weak here, bordering on cute, unsure. Especially when Schnittke's text is deliberately scarce, it comes out flat. It feels as if no dramaturgy supports the music and for Schnittke, one of the most cinematographic composers of our time, that's quite a bust! And those belly gauzing strings, they work so hard to sit heavily on each and every dissonances that they barely keep the rhythm going -Piano Quartet- and one feels this becomes a refuge to mask their endless meandering to nowhere near figuring out what this music is all about. Dissonances in Schnittke do not need this insistence, they are merely a tool to set up an atmosphere, not an end in themselves as per the Molinari prosaic stomping. Sure, arguments of authority, awards and every other pompous biographical bits will try to impress quidams, but one needs simply to listen to the Borodine to know all there is to think about that cheap trick.

But when their label promote reads ""... described by the critics as ""Canada's answer to the Kronos or Arditti Quartet"", this becomes truly farcical: since when and from whom did the Arditti Quartet need ""an answer"" and from Canada to boot? Really, what a preposterous, arrogant statement to print! I recall this anecdote when I saw the Arditti at the auditorium du Louvre in Paris in the early 90s, people were sitting on the new amphitheatre steps as it was full house. Compare this to University of Calgary where the same quartet played the Ligeti no. 2 in front of a thinning audience few months later... So much for appreciating the real deal! Again, listen to the String Quartet no. 2 played by Arditti to measure their intelligence in reading, and sensibility to this music. There is transformation not merely representation, replication.

Schnittke's music is masterful and too important to our reality to be left to such prosaic advocates. Please, do not miss its magnificence and search for the references: you'll be amply rewarded."
Same ol beat <SEP> Kind of blah.
Worth it <SEP> Arrived timely and as described.
Waste of money <SEP> Not the item described. Waste of money.

Great old Rock <SEP> I stream this and just love it.
"Not the full song <SEP> This is the second mp3 I've paid for from Amazon only to find after I downloaded it that it wasn't the full version of the song. It definitely does NOT say anything on the page itself to inform you that it isn't the full version of the song. Sorry, Amazon, but I'm not buying any more mp3s from you."
"amazing <SEP> The song is reflective, has volume and fills  me upyet unassuming. Its soul food as it also goes to my faith."

Always Excellent <SEP> Excellent music that stands the test of time. This album has brought me loads of enjoyment.  These guys have been making music for so long yet they still rock.
this is not a re-release <SEP> track 13 and 14 are missing from the 1991 release.  It is not the same album that was released in 1991
So not about Christmas <SEP> So not about Christmas
"a bunch of sounds badly piecemealed together <SEP> has no style. if you'd like to know what scrambled brains sound like then pick this.
there is a older blues version that is well worth it"
"wrong concerto <SEP> Not the 5th Mozart Concerto, but the 3rd. Great performances, however. Too bad because there is a fifth concerto with Szigeti."
Five Stars <SEP> great
OMG what a waste of $ <SEP> I was listening to this and not long into the album I was wondering who else in the office was playing some crap music and it wasn't someone else it was me.  What an absolute waste of money.  I feel silly for not listening to the song before purchase.  Learned my lesson.
"Puh-leeeez!! <SEP> First, this music isn't even remotely evocative of Christmas.  It is two Beethoven quartets and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart.  Second, although the Amazon mp3 sample list shows four musicians listed on the Beethovens, no mention of the musicians is evident on the CD packaging or on the [...] website (the site for the producer of this CD).  Third, Mozart and Beethoven are not mentioned on the Amazon listing, the CD packaging, or on the RothMar site.  The neophyte listener is left to wonder, ""How could I find more music like this?""

Now to my main complaint--this music is almost certainly midi-sequenced and in places (particularly in Eine Kleine) even sounds like an accordion rather than strings.  There are none of the slight differences in sound that an actual bowed instrument would make.  There is no rubato in the interpretation, no stretching out or minuscule pauses which are hallmarks of live interpretation of classical music; it simply plows on with metronomic accuracy.

I gave it two stars because I don't hate it (that would be the one-star rating), but I feel deceived in not being informed that this is computer-generated music.  The ""Product Description"" (above, in the Editorial Reviews section) is obviously a fantasy--no emotions are evident in this rendering nor could this have been performed in a candle-lit theater.  As background music at a party or such, it could suffice; there are none of those annoying soft or loud sections which disappear under or overwhelm conversation.  Not worth the price."
SOMETHING EASY <SEP> I RIPPED THIS SONG ON TO A MIXED CD TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH AND IT HAS A CATCHY TUNE WHICH I TRY TO AIM FOR.
"Four Stars <SEP> Davis has very good voice but don't really like the arrangement, but it does swing quite nicely"

"An Old Favorite =) <SEP> Shalamar's Full of Fire -- This track is an old favorite, which is as good today as it was...back in the day.  =)"
Proud to know her! <SEP> Priviledged to report Jazmina is a REALLY close friend of mine!! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE her music!!!
"Not so hot <SEP> This is a very early recording of chants from the monks of Encalcat.  The record is scratchy.  I can remedy that by editing.  However, the recording quality, unfortunately, is not as good as later albums produced at this monastery.  I wish they would put out a new album of chants.  These monks do a beautiful job of rendering Gregorian Chant.  I would buy anything else they released for sale.  A further problem with this album is that one complete side of the record is not done by the monks of Encalcat but by Trappist monks.  No offense, but the Trappists' renderings are just not as good at all."
"Not as advertised <SEP> The low rating is of course not for Beethoven, but for the digital version of this recording. I downloaded this to discover that the tracks do not play in the order in which they appear on the Amazon page. Instead, I get the first movement of the 13 quartet, followed by the first movement of the 14th, the first movement of the 15th, and so on. It's a pain, and if I'd known this in advance I wouldn't have bought this."
"Excellent! <SEP> This song is the reason I became a fan of Jennah Bell! Her voice is amazing, and the lyrics are very insightful and meaningful."
"Hot 5* <SEP> A MUST BUY!!!! GO AND GET IT IF YOU DON'T GOT IT NOW!!!  @WhyCueSPG

"Anonymous by TDG <SEP> This song is simply beautiful. It has a mix of a beautiful melodic tone that will go into a heavy chorus, which probably makes this song in my top 5 favorite songs by them. It also has a nice instrumental piece, and Three Days Grace does not do many instrumental pieces. Buy this song! I think it's the best off the album! Right up there with Operate."
"5 stars is not enough! <SEP> I love Liz Story music.  It is so colorfull, so joyfull that Im pretty sure Im going to keep buying more."

"I have purchased a good number of 78s from Amazon suppliers <SEP> I am not sure you can put zero stars or I would have ... first the records in the set are in no way connected to the cover, second all the records had through both sides radius cracks ... 78s are so dense the hold together but a big pop sound on each and ever rotation and one record had a huge bite (if you will) out of the edge.  I have purchased a good number of 78s from Amazon suppliers, never gotten any in this condition including a couple of ""bulkish"" ... quite a number in a pack of which you have no idea what is included.  Almost all 78s are in less the perfect condition but these are barely playable.  I just purchased two 78s on Ebay that were in GREAT shape for basically this same amount of money ... Glenn Miller  .... so even renowned music.  Very disappointing."
Great song but has a unknown noise n this one <SEP> I love the song because I had it years ago but this one has a background noise like a wratling or something through the whole song.
Not the version I wanted <SEP> This version seemed like a techno version. It was not the song I used to jam to back in college.
"Not worth it <SEP> The book brings up some good points, but the whole thing is only like 15 mins long! Most of the info is very spot-on, its just not worth the $9"
One Star <SEP> The record was scratched badly!!!!!

"Close but no sigar. <SEP> This is the closest thing I could get to the original CD track.  It's better than nothing, but it's still not what I wanted."
Five Stars <SEP> Duane Eddy's best album.
One Star <SEP> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. this cd is absolute garbage. Do not buy.

"Sommervisionen 2 - Vision Live <SEP> This was a bad buy. The title suggests Live tracks, perhaps even a bonus video. What you get is bad music. Only 2 tracks are live (not the best James Brown cuts out there - and there are plenty). There are a few original hits. Everything else is studio remakes, and not really decent ones either. I wanted to send it back, but there was no receipt inside or shipping instructions (to somewhere in Europe). I won't buy from them anymore and I am no longer confortable buying imports. The seller was Medimops Logistik in Neuenhagen (presumeably Germany - Zip (and country) unknown)."
"Like the song says...I was Speechlees <SEP> Most enchanted song...deep and lovely. Great band ans is worth every cent  I pay because
its a song of love"
? <SEP> Did not order this product. Do not know how it got put on my list. Have to look into it?
"songs drag on <SEP> I'm a runner and I bought these ""hits"" because I wanted energetic songs that I knew the words to. While that IS what I got with this product, I also found that the songs dragged on and on with pure instrumental segments spliced in. It was a turn off, and now the music is just sitting in my Amazon cloud, never to be used."
"One Star <SEP> Very basic and simple, no thought involved"

"This movie is made...but khamakha nahi <SEP> This is one of the most intelligent Hindi movies I have seen. One has to know local lingo and be politically aware to understand jokes. The music of the movie is certainly not Vishal Bhardwaj's best but still leagues ahead of regular Bollywood crap. Listen to Khamakha  for once or twice completely and I bet it will be playing on loop for days to come.
Thanks Amazon for selling this album online."
"Meh! Artistic but doesn't stick <SEP> Music: Vishal Bhardwaj

Vishal Bhardwaj's Indian classical leanings and a penchant for clean, well-themed music is evident in this album. Unfortunately, it does not translate into a fulfilling album in any particular genre. The most it gets is mention for a few songs. Overall, a decent and quirky album without much to care about.

Brownie points:
Oye Boy Charlie - If there was a second coming of Kajraare Kajraare from Bunty Aur Babli, this is it. Everything about this song: the opening, the fast paced mujra, the background qawwali, the unrefined feel to the song and the cheesiness, it's all there. Only if this was the first song of this genre would it have been as hit. Good, but not really.
Badal Uthiya, Badal Uthiya (Reprise) - For the soft and melodic Indian classical loving fans, this one won't disappoint. Rekha Bhardwaj sticks to her forte of classical Indian music, except this time she doesn't sound pretentious (like I had criticized her before). The Reprise version sounds equally well, if you like this one that is, which is a male version sung by Prem Dehati who gives this song an authentic Haryanwi harundertones.
Lootnewale - Sukhwinder Singh and Master Saleem deliver a raw and energetic song. In terms of artistic value, this is a great piece which sticks true to it's theme and cultural nuances, but just not entertaining enough to remember.
Khamakha - This song feels like one that would be real nice and pleasant with it's opening, but just turns into a dragging affair with it's slow pace. As an audience, we hope the song blooms into something nice midway, but it doesn't and it is almost too late for a superb piece of devotional chorus at the end."
"Great track, even though it's not Psy <SEP> For some reason I thought this was a workout mix of Psy singing ""Gangam Style"", but it was someone different. Nevertheless, the guy does sound a lot like Psy, and the track got me through my workout just the same, so all in all I'd recommend it."
"A great soundtrack to one of the best parts of Jojo. <SEP> The soundtrack for part 2 of Jojo, Battle Tendency. Now I was a little upset when I saw this didn't include the shows opening them Bloody Stream, already knew Roundabout was by YES, but I still got this anyway since I especially liked battle tendencies music. The CD came in perfect condition, plays really well and the music is great. Has a little booklet with the lyrics to some of the songs too, and I'm lucky these songs are english so I can read it. Overall, if you're the kind of person who is big on owning merchandise of a show they like and loved Battle Tendencies music then this is worth the $20 and wait."
One Star <SEP> Mistaken purchase
Not what I expected <SEP> I should have listened to this version before downloading it.
"One Star <SEP> Not my style, maybe."
One Star <SEP> Horrible interpretation!
"Not what I expected. <SEP> This was not a version that I expected. Maybe I should have listened to a sample before purchasing. I had hoped to download it onto my kids MP3 players, but this wouldn't do for that at all."

Great songs! Brought memories of youth <SEP> Great songs!  Brought memories of youth. Sound quality is excellent.
My review <SEP> Nancy Grandquist is one of my favorite Gospel artists.  This is a great CD! I highly recommend it to everyone.
Song for my husband <SEP> I sang this song for my husband at our wedding ceremony. He met me when I was apart of a singing group and has always been there supporting me in my singing persuits. It was only fitting to sing to him on our special day.
"Lyrical wizardry ness. <SEP> If you like Richard, and you like Cypress Hill, then this is gonna blow your mind. Still singing Richard's version; as I bought Cypress Hill's the dah it was released (yeah, they still sold cassettes then)!"
"Mislabeled Songs <SEP> The songs are great. But some of them were wrongly labelled. It is annoying when you select your favorite songs, they appear to be different ones."
Laughable accept that my money is involved <SEP> I think that this guy tried to capitalize on the real artist and song title to get himself recognized but I feel completely ripped off to have purchased this song.
"Disappointing Experience <SEP> The album was misleading because it actually excluded vocals of the primary artists R. Kelly and Usher. This fact was noted only after the recordings were downloaded, so there was no possibility of a return and refund. It was a truly disappointing purchasing experience."
Two Stars <SEP> I can not download this to my computer.  I wish it was a CD I could purchase !!!
"Matisyahu and P.O.D!? Holy crap! WORTH IT! <SEP> What happens when Jewish ska meets a christian hard rock band? Something borderling on a magical miracle, thats what! This song is short, maybe too short? Yet, it delivers! I love it! I would have never thought something like this would ever happen, considering how most Orthodox Jews are raised to reject or ignore Christ Jesus, but the fact that the wall between the two beliefs came down long enough for this song to be made, excellent! Totally worth listening to and purchasing! Very well made."
"solid funk for the cause <SEP> This compilation is a delicious refreshing sampler of some of the funkiest artists out there today - How great to know that these folks are doing their thang now and not just jewels excavated from a dusty crate - solid tracks, solid mix and a beautiful cause. Worth every penny!"
"Would have like ONE SONG <SEP> Unfortunately I could not order JUST Amyzing Mayzie by itself, so I had to order the two songs together."
"One Star <SEP> horrible sound quality, sounds like a bad cassette tape copy"
One Star <SEP> It was OK.
"Ray! <SEP> Ray Charles does this song like no one else. RIP, Ray-you were awesome. Your music will touch us for generations!"
Two Stars <SEP> a poor digital recording. It makes a squeaking noise in the beginning.
Great album from great guys and performers <SEP> Great album from great guys and performers. Music from these guys will mesmerize you and get you addicted. Must listen.
"Hilarious. <SEP> I love April Smith & The Great Picture Show in general and this song is catchy and hilarious! I love holidays and holiday music, and while this making fun of overdecorating for Christmas, I love it."
"Two Stars <SEP> I didn't care for this rendition at all.  It was OK, nothing special"
Disappointed. <SEP> I thought I was buying a karaoke mp3 and there are voices on this singing the song.  Disappointed.
One Star <SEP> Very very boring. Waste of money.
"not karaoke <SEP> This said it was a karaoke track, but there's someone singing.  That's not what I wanted.  I wanted instrumentals only.  Very frustrating."
Five Stars <SEP> Fun songs!
One Star <SEP> did not like it!
"One Star <SEP> Very simplistic, no thought involved"
Five Stars <SEP> Que lo vendan en espaol please.
"Material Girl  - Richard Cheese <SEP> I once saw Richard Cheese live and in person, and enjoyed his music a great deal.  Not so much with this MP3."
"Music that will transport you to a calm place <SEP> Absolutely beautiful, calming, deeply spiritual. I've let others know of this CD and they are equally taken by it. In high rotation in my collection. Great to meditate, study, reflect."
music <SEP> this was a download song by mistake. the song i was trying to find was hurry up and choose by mozilla
Product was not good <SEP> Product was not good
"Great song, remix version <SEP> I had this song sense I bought a techno mix CD and liked it ever sense.  I can't say I'm fond of this version.  However, I like it.  I'm also buying it again in MP3 because of the new terms of service Amazon was forced into.  This way none of my songs come from ripped CD's.  I'm all legal."
GLORY!!! <SEP> Good glory music about the finished work of the Cross!!! It's so good!!! I can't wait to listen and dance to their next albums!!!
One Star <SEP> Clarity and quality of music is sub par.
"Need to be clear about this. <SEP> Its not Hank Sr. Studio sessions is not a description of who the artist is. This is NOT HANK WILLIAMS SR.
It is however an awesome well written song."
"No Vocals :( <SEP> Obviously Santana is fabulous, but there was no indication prior to purchase that this was an instrumental version.  I was looking for a shorter version (less than 5 minutes) with vocals, so I was disappointed after opening the downloaded file.  The ""snipit"" did not provide enough information and neither did the product details."
Five Stars <SEP> Thank You
Be Careful When You Buy <SEP> Not what I expected...snippet heard gave false impression.
Great Piece <SEP> The time changes and over all bass/tuba part are great. I bought it to help me with my part of the piece. I'm performing it with a group here in FL.
"unique song! <SEP> love it! i found them on pandora and after that i was hooked on a few of they're songs, probably my favorite song!"
"Not the real thing <SEP> Sux
not Celine Dion false advertisement!!! really mad I can't return/delete from my play list do not buy. I can't find the original Celine Dion version anywhere not even on iTunes. Tried to preview it but it was so short wish they played the preview longer like iTunes is doing now"
"Dig it! <SEP> Whenever I hear this song, it makes me want to get my old DG BMX bike out and go jump off of shipping docks and jump medians between parking lots.  Way to go Gadjet."
Two Stars <SEP> Not the song gasoline is affording their fame.
"Ok, that's nice. How about something newer than Stevie Ray remakes <SEP> KWS is riding the Blue on Black wave too much.
Write something new, already"
"Five Stars <SEP> Just a great effort, with a great vibe."
One Star <SEP> Download was full of static
Nice <SEP> This has a middle eastern sound to it at the beginning.  I really really like it.  It's very nice to listen to.
Four Stars <SEP> love the groove!
"I feel mislead. this is NOT Diana Ross <SEP> I fell for the ad design that looks as if Diana Ross is singing it. Not the picture, but the biggest font on the ad is her name. Nowhere on that picture does it easy point out that it's not Diana.  The singer isn't at all bad but that's not the point. I think it should be made clearer that this is not Diana."
Five Stars <SEP> Good times. Blast from the past.
"NO LYRICS!!! <SEP> I was looking for this song for Karaoke, and all that there is, is just music, there are no lyrics which make it very difficult to use this for Karaoke after I had to pay for the song."
"WOW!!  This albums is FANTASTIC!! <SEP> This may be one of the best funeral doom albums (and I write that just because people may need it to be classified, it may be one of the best doom metal albums) I have listened to/bought to date.  I discovered it while I was looking for other Mourning Beloveth albums.  The emotion, production value, mix is top notch! I love the mix in of the female vocals.  Subtle, but fits perfectly.  If you are into Mourning Beloveth, Mournful Gust and such...do what I did, buy this and start looking for more!  Fantastic! Five stars cause thats how I roll when I like something this much"
Whimsical and fun <SEP> Love this song. It is positive and uplifting. Whimsical and fun. Once I hear it in my play list I can't stop singing. Everyone could use a little encouragement for their Possibilities.
Mary-Chapin Carpenter Karaoke CD-G <SEP> I found the quality to be top notch!  I have been paying over $24.00 a Disk for years for maybe one song I wanted to learn to sing.  So many of the Disks are from Brand Name Companies!  What MORE could you ask for.  Same Disk--at half the price or LESS!
Five Stars <SEP> Just a fun song. Heard it on xM and have been a fan.
"This is NOT Al Jarreau! <SEP> The description of this song (album) is misleading. Actually, it's a downright scam. The title is ""The Hits of Al Jarreau"" and Al Jarreau's name is featured prominently in the artwork. However, Al Jarreau does not appear on this recording. I searched for ""Since I Fell For You Al Jarreau"" and this was the first item that came up in the search. Without examining it in detail it looked like the right song so I bought it, only to be disappointed. I re-searched and found the actual song by Al Jarreau, and bought that.

To Amazon's credit, a chat representative refunded the order immediately with no fuss."
"journey thru time <SEP> When I hear his music I feel like a leave flowing thru  and emotions.
My mind wonders and all my worries
Are forgotten."
Not good qualuty <SEP> Deleated
One Star <SEP> sucks..sucks .. sucks
Five Stars <SEP> Krunk jam. Got my subwoofers jumpin'!
Five Stars <SEP> I Like This Song. 5 Stars
"Good Song <SEP> Very Catchy! Song has a great beat. Something you can vibe to in you car. Also when the beat drops, you can get hype!"
Perfect <SEP> Its hard to make a song work with no hook but if you get enuff quality MCs together It can be done. This beat is simple but driving so for non stop Rhyming it works perfect
No introduction on Lusty month of May for my students.... <SEP> no intro to the piece .
kareoki <SEP> I wanted the song but this is just music
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Noticeably Low Quality <SEP> I really enjoy ""Need Your Heart (feat. Kai)""and bought both it and the first track of this album ""Need Your Heart (Protohype Remix) [feat. Kai]"" However when I was listening to both of them back to back the audio volume suddenly dropped by about  of the current output level.

Subsequently I rated this track & remix as horrible. I paid for a song that isn't even in high enough definition to enjoy.

*NOTE* I did NOT try to re-download ""YET"".

**EDIT** 8/17/13

I went to my cloud, and it also had the low quality. I don't think I can get a refund on this. Thankfully it's only $1."
One Star <SEP> Thought I was getting Vince Gills
"The wrong version of his rendition of the song was placed on the album!!!!! <SEP> I was never so disappointed in my life. This person with such a superb voice being force to stifle his genius in this rendition of the song. I heard the exact same Justine Guarini sing this very song without being pigeon holed--he ripped it. I assumed this was that version before purchase. Had I known this wasn't the same YouTube version, I would have continued to play it on YouTube for free. Don't get me wrong, this song is lovely enough, but too commercial and doesn't fully show what this artist is capable of--like the aforementioned version--a copy of which I would ""kill"" to actually have.

To the powers that be: no wonder his career failed in spite of his genius. Some executive decided it best to make him hold back. What an absolute loss to us, the thirsty consumers and to Justin Guarini."
"Beautiful classic christmas song ftom the legend himself <SEP> Beautiful classic christmas song ftom the legend himself, Frank Sinatra.  Instantly puts you in the Christmas mood, and brings up pleasant memories of Christmas' past."
"Skips <SEP> Song has skips in it, downloaded 3 different times"
WOW <SEP> This song is amazing. Come Alive is a really good band and it's too bad they aren't worldwide yet. This song speaks leagues.
Four Stars <SEP> Very nice
Not a good version. Has static that interrupts the track early ... <SEP> Not a good version. Has static that interrupts the track early on in the song. Amazon should be sending out refunds for this bad boy.
"Songs Aren't All New - But Great Traditional Bachata <SEP> This is a good compilation of old-school style Bachata. Just keep in mind that despite the album title, these are mostly songs from early 2012. Even though I prefer modern Bachata (Prince Royce, Aventura, Xtreme), I still enjoy the traditional sound from time to time.

What's great about this album is that most of the artists are established, unlike some of the compilations with just a bunch of unknown Bachateros. ""I Love Bachata 2013"" has Yoskar Sarante, El Chaval, Frank Reyes; a good number of artists with hit songs recently and going back to the 90's. You also get a bit of the modern Bachata sound thanks to tracks like ""Por Mentira"" by Grupo Vena.  My only complaint would be that a few songs such as those from Kiko Rodriguez, El Chaval and Luis Segura are from 2011. At least two of the songs (by Truhanes and Emocion) were on the radio back in 2010. So just know that it's not all 2013 music.

This is a good collection of songs if you like the older Bachata style. The entire MP3 album on Amazon costs less a Starbucks Frappuccino, so there's no reason why you shouldn't buy it now if you like Bachata."
Turned my sunny day into a downpour. <SEP> This is borderline mythical.
"Taylor Davis fan <SEP> I'm not crazy about Game music per-say, that's why 4 stars and not 5,  But both Taylor and Lara are talented artist.  I think you will like this album and is worth the price.
Also Taylor makes great videos as well. Catch her on You-Tube. https://www.youtube.com/user/ViolinTay"
NOT THE SOUNDTRACK <SEP> Not the soundtrack.... I didn't pay attention to what I was buying.. now I am stuck with it.
"It's ok at first <SEP> but then you realize big chunks are not in the 8-bit version that are in the original.
The song kind of falls apart at the end as well."
Princess Mononoke: Ta. Ta. Ri. Gami <SEP> This is another must have for Joe Hisaishi music made for Hayao Miyazaki movie soundtrack music lovers. Especially for those who love the movie 'Princess Mononoke'.
Not worth a dollar. <SEP> Synthesizer music. Didn't spend the money for real instruments and it shows. Unuseable.
"favorite dance song <SEP> We dance to this song in my zumba dance class at Golds gym, it is one of my favorite songs!"
"Wonderful Album!!! <SEP> ""I gotta say that this album only gets better every time I listened to it. My first impressions were good but I believe a great record needs to grow on you a bit, which this one has. Great throughout every song really. These guys nailed it and them some. When Love Rescued Me is one of my favorites from the album. I can't get Falling Through the Sky out of my head! Broken Heart makes me feel like I'm in a movie searching for something...I love walking to my train at night with this song blaring! And The Things That I Forgot...I love the lyrics. This is a solid tune all the way through. One of mine and my wife's favs. I am a huge fan of the record...and I know you will be as well if you BUY THIS CD!"""
Not all the Same <SEP> I heard this album on a friends ipod on a road trip about a week ago and had to get it for myself. There is something about long travels that really put music to the test and this cd passed with flying colors. So many different emotions come to the surface over the course of this album it's easy to find oneself turning it up just because or hoping that last note will hold on just a little bit longer. This will be in regular rotation for the forseeable future.
Five Stars <SEP> Great album!
"I loooove this song <SEP> Dita Von Teese does an excellent job with the vocals (even though I'm certain a veritable army of sound recording geniuses was called in to doctor the end result to perfection). Regardless, Dita is an amazing persona(lity) and breathes incredible life to a song by and incredible band. Watch the video on YouTube, she is flawless."
Five Stars <SEP> JUST WHAT i EXPECTED IT TO BE..
Not great. Fake synthesized sound is noticeable. <SEP> The karaoke versions by Studio Musicians can be hit or mss. This one is a miss as it SOUNDS tinny and obviously synthesized.
"It's a bootleg and sounds great for a bootleg <SEP> It's a bootleg and sounds great for a bootleg!  It is not fake, in fact it is as real as it gets.  If you're a ""real fan"" you will love to add it to your collection.  If you only like uber polished recordings, well then you're missing out!"
"BOOTLEG <SEP> BOOTLEG.
If it's not a Roadrunner or Metal Blade release it is fake."
"mercyful fate / king diamond <SEP> Hi diamond fans. I purchased this disc for one reason and that's because I'm a huge king diamond fan. I ordered this disc just to be so disappointed. The quality is very poor and even though I'm a huge fan well its just not worth it. The sound sounds like a crappy boot leg. So from a huge fan dnt buy this save your money it is not worth it at all. I didn't want to give it any stars but it made me otherwise i wouldnt.
Dr Satan"
It was free <SEP> it was free
CRAPOLA <SEP> the cost is too high the return on investment too low and vastly over rated in my mind. Nothing more to say.
Not Hanks tune at all <SEP> Not your father's Lovesick Blues nor mine.  I was fooled by the title to expect a newer version of Hank WIlliams wonderful half yodeling song.  This time I expected some harmonies added perhaps the yodels in harmony as well.  But this was a very long dirge in comparison and not at all related to the wonderful songs by the legendary Hank.  I was not happy while listening to it or afterwards.
"Great music, but bad presentation! <SEP> Mixing is non-existent; instruments & vocals can only be heard from distinct separate channels....not a pleasent listening experience.  Pass on this one."
did not like having a sing along......... <SEP> needed the  words and the music not a sing along. I could just put on an original and sing with  her........
"Not a pleasant experience <SEP> This song is not good, even in the early days of Stoner Metal.  What was more upsetting to me back when the Sonic Orb EP was released, is that I expected to have a Doom Metal album, and instead got something I was not into.  The first time I heard a song by this band was back in the mid-90's in the compilation 'Death... Is Just The Beginning 3', and the song was called ""Above Azure Oceans"".  I was going to purchase their 'Solar Lovers' album after all the positive reviews.  Instead, they had this turd at the record store, so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  Big mistake.

Now, I thought that I was very harsh on this one because I was not into Stoner Metal, so I gave it another chance after getting into the genre almost twenty years later.  I can now appreciate bands like Sleep, OM, Bongzilla, Kyuss, and Electric Wizard.  So after gaining new appreciation for the music, I decided to revisit Celestial Season's first foray into this universe.  It sucks.  You're better off buying Sleep's Jerusalem, and Dopesmoker (which is the same album, but different cuts) than buying this piece of crap.  Avoid at all costs."
Hydra is a masterpiece <SEP> The concept works. Great album and story telling from start to finish. Apex predator has an infectious beat and the lyrics paint a vivid dark portrait.
"This song is a great start to what is sure to be an epic cd! <SEP> With a heavy beat and more of a 'hip hop"" style used in earlier works, this song is sure to leave you wanting more from the Apex Predator.. OT3P!!"
One Star <SEP> interesting
"Love this! <SEP> This cd is amazing...great subject...beautiful voice, very well done. Makes me feel as tho i am there with the horses running wild."
Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!  You'll love it!!! <SEP> Great folk sound! All the songs are great!  You will love this album and is definetely worth the purchase price of 8.91!  It has been playing on my iPhone for days.  Please support the artist and cause.  Also check out opusmoonmusic.com for more information.
Horses <SEP> I heard about this from a friend and I love the calm messages of the music.  I like it and will get more in the future.
Would Not Waste Your Money <SEP> These are simply original songs done by other artist. The instrumental part sounds true to the original but the singing is pretty poor.
Five Stars <SEP> We need more MEGAS!
I Would Not Waste Your Money. <SEP> This is simply a copy of the original by a different artist. The instrumental sounds true to the original but the singing is pretty poor.
"Stranger Things Rocks! <SEP> I saw this band in Tarzana, along with four other bands, and they stole the show!  I love these guys and their sound.  Some songs are hard rock and some are a lot more mellow.  My personal favorite is, ""I Will Miss You"".  I plan on seeing them live again soon."
"Johnny Carson closed his very last TV show singing 'Here's ... <SEP> Johnny Carson closed his very last TV show singing
'Here's That Rainy Day' with Beth Midler.

It never ceases to give me pleasure listening to it."
This is a CDR! do not buy! <SEP> This is not a real retail compact disc. It is a CDR with a homemade digipak. How is selling these online legal!? Unacceptable.
"Good song, but poor MP3 quality <SEP> Hello Amazon,

I downloaded the song and discovered that the recording quality was not good. It sound almost as an old mono instead of stereo recording.

I guess you could check the quality of the MP3s you offer."
Made me nervous. <SEP> Too upbeat for my taste.
One Star <SEP> All the songs have the same sound! Please listen first.
Not the original artists. <SEP> These songs are not from the original artists.  I was very disappointed.
Don't like the singing or the arraingements <SEP> Just Yuck!!! Not what I thought I was buying. Don't like the singing or the arraingements.
no no no <SEP> Terrible cover bands playing popular tunes make it difficult to listen to. I don't recommend it unless you can handlec that.
"Some surprises are not good! <SEP> I was very disappointed that it was not the original artists. I guess I live and learn.  Save your money, don't buy it."
curse word among religious statues <SEP> I was shocked and surprise by this ad.  Causes me to think twice before ordering anything from Amazon if I can get it elsewhere.  No doubt there are plenty of sites to purchase religious statues.
"the title offends me, would not even dare to type it <SEP> I find it very offensive that you would even put a product with the F word it the title let alone profane Jesus, May God have mercy on you"
"it's orchestrated so beautifully. Whoever put it together really did an amazing ... <SEP> Here's why I wish I could buy it: it's orchestrated so beautifully. Whoever put it together really did an amazing job.

Here's why no singer can allow themselves to buy it: the actual final recording here is DISTORTED (really????)- seriously- how could you do this. That's really a shame because it's so wonderfully put together- and the person who recorded it to file didn't even set the levels right, so that, as soon as the orchestra comes in, you hear the static-y distortion almost the rest of the way through.

Engineer, nice job ruining such a nice job!

And now, it's unusable by anyone who would perform this in public. And you guys are the only decent orchestration of this song in karaoke I could find on the Internet- and the recording engineer trashed it? Just, damn..
..well, and, also, just, wow.."
Five Stars <SEP> wife loves it
"Great songs BUT, they all sound the same. <SEP> Was super excited when I read this list of songs and thought they would be perfect for my workout. Although they are super upbeat and great songs they all sound the same. They have the exact same beat and tempo and it becomes extremely repetitive which in turn becomes a bit boring."
"Not the real deal <SEP> I have no idea WHAT this is, but it is NOT the Philippine folk song I was trying to download. It is a half-minute of something that sound vaguely Japanese, but is not a song. If I could give a negative star review I would. I feel lucky I was only cheated out of $0.99."
"eh it was a childhood song <SEP> It was good when I was a kid... Now it's just a distant memory. But oh well, it's just nothing now."
"Finally found this Webb Pierce song <SEP> I first heard this song in Biloxi, and it caught fire at Keesler.  Webb was a major then, and had quite a few big ones.  This one come out on the ""Webb With A Beat"" album, and everyone was playing it and singing along.  Good ""Classic"" country."
"5 star <SEP> Super inspirational, beautiful music!!!"
"Apocalyptic midtempo black metal <SEP> Solidly in the 90's tradition. Rather than blast beats, these songs are midtempo and feature a fair amount of keyboards. Therefore it resembles Gehenna or Carpathian Forest if you're into those bands. Perhaps a dash of Satanic Warmaster, Drudkh, or Darkthrone as well. Nothing groundbreaking here at all, but there are some good songs worth checking out."
One Star <SEP> Get rid of the clean versions.
"The only version of this song worth listening to <SEP> In fact, this is the only version of this song you'll want to hear again & again. I heard this SiriusXM Deep Tracks. I should have bought the entire album -- probably will next Christmas season."
Five Stars <SEP> Such a great mother-son song...we made it fun by singing along and just being proud instead of sad..
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"Great mix of melodies! <SEP> I bought this album because it has ""Let's Get It All Together"" and I was curious to know what other songs I could remember hearing. I didn't hear any other songs I remembered, but it was refreshing and relaxing to listen to."
Two Stars <SEP> each song sounds like last
"music great but recording not so much <SEP> A: MP3: I really like the music, that gets 5 stars. I listened to it first on spotify and really liked it and then purchased the MP3 from Amazon. This is the first time that the MP3 is worse then Spotify's stream, the basses are clattering and rattling in some tracks quite horribly. I never had that problem with my headphones (Bower & Wilkins nevertheless), never changed any settings on my computer (iTunes, Mac). Waiting for refund from Amazon and bought the CD

B: CD same music, deeper and much better sound. Here I would really say get the CD, it makes a difference. Music - again, love it, listen to it the last 3days"
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song!
"Love this song <SEP> Taste in music is personal and subjective think. I'm a Linkin Park fan, so I'm biased, but I really love this song."
Five Stars <SEP> It was a free download.
Trance To Freedom! <SEP> Wow what a surge of energy of Trance music. You need to listen to this track on the highway!
"Not a good sound for me <SEP> Not the best recording in my opinion.  Mp3s must be done with great care because of the frequencies that are lost in the compression.

I would say more, but I found out I can be sued for recommending a product that turns out bad for someone.  Or I guess for not saying someone's product is wonderful.  Anyway, I personally did not care for it."
"Great Robot Music <SEP> I really enjoyed this track, I really liked the Robot voices and complex sounds on this track."
"Left The Movement to do this? <SEP> Jordan was in one of the best Reggae-Rock-HipHop bands out there. He left The Movement, who was on the brink of success.. To do this?!? All I gotta say is, wtf man?.. wtf? Take It Back To THE MOVEMENT!.. Or at least play reggae again! This aint cuttin it bud. The Movement would be HUGE right now if you'd never left AND Josh came back!"
"Five Stars <SEP> I love Suen May's songs, this album is one of the best from her."
Five Stars <SEP> Great quality!
"I didn't enjoy as much as i thought i would <SEP> sonng is ok, not really my style i guess. I didn't enjoy as much as i thought i would, but who knows maybe it's me"
I did not buy this <SEP> Don't know how this got in my queue but I did not buy it.  So how can I rate it?
"recording are not good <SEP> not what I expected.
recording are not good quality"
Lika Mika <SEP> This sound is very catchy and easy to listen to too.  I really enjoyed it and will probably check out more songs by Mika and / or Ariana Grande.
Thank you! <SEP> Thank you so much! I honestly did not expect the actual vinyl when I ordered due to it's rarity. You made a lotus fan very happy this day. As for the album's music and amazingness.....I'm biased. It is top level
"Build Up The Beat <SEP> Great Buy For a Well Put Together Album, As a Lotus Fan or someone who is interested how their style has developed over the years this is a nice CD to have a copy of. : ) They are still jammin strong!! Much Love."
"Great 2 songs by Hiiragi Rio's (RioRio) original group <SEP> Great 2 songs by Hiiragi Rio's (RioRio) original group.
You can find Hiiragi Rio singing on twitcast, NicoVideo, and Showroom broadcasts every day.

Rio's twitter: @HiiragiRio."
"So relaxing <SEP> I found out about Dustin through Pandora. His music is very soothing and relaxing. I listen to it at work, and my sister started using it as background music at the spa where she is a massage therapist."
"not great <SEP> not like his early work...not having a way to check out the song first was just a way to make you buy it and then regret it, even for  $0.99."
"Counterfeit item sold to buyer <SEP>    !
The product received is a counterfeit item. It is a burned CD with photo-copied paper on the front and the back of the CD. The songs work and the quality is relatively decent, however the overall perspective is that this seller is selling counterfeit items. This is intolerable. This negative remark shall not be deleted, even if the problem is resolved. Counterfeit items should not be sold online via EBAY and/or AMAZON."
"Still pretty. <SEP> I thought this was the version with the part 2 lyrics. There is no singing, it is entirely instrumental. Not what I expected to hear. Still pretty."
Good Salsa <SEP> Good combination of artists and Victor Manuelle knows how to do it well. The song is perfect and sounds great I can stop listening to this song.
"One Star <SEP> This is NOT the original, nor is it a remix. This has been ""re-recorded"" by another artist."
"Chopin as played by Chopin? <SEP> I first discovered the recordings of Raul Koczalski when I bought the 2 CD set from Marston Records of the first volume of a projected Complete Recordings of Raul Koczalski and listened to it. Several times, because it was quite enchanting Chopin playing. Music & Arts also released a 2 disc set of mostly post-war radio broadcast recordings. Even more than the Marston set of commercial recordings, these Chopin performances were almost magical. Perhaps, as with some other musicians, Koczalski found recording in a studio restrictive, but in his post-war radio recordings, he felt more like he was performing a concert. Reading the notes on the Marston and Music & Arts set suggests that perhaps a reason for this special quality in the Chopin performances was Koczalski's early and extensive training with Chopin's favorite pupil, Mikuli, and the direct line linking Koczalski to Chopin and (Mikuli's interpretation of) his performance techniques.  Regardless, listening to Koczalski perform Chopin is quite a special experience, and I sought more.

From 1998-2000, Selene Records in Poland released 7 CDs of recordings by Koczalski. Amazon now has all seven volumes of the Selene Koczalski series available for mp3 download. I personally have no interest in mp3 since it uses lossy compression which throws away much of the musical content in ways that most people supposedly won't notice. I have managed to get all the CDs so I don't need listen to mp3. However, if you listen to mp3 music recordings and enjoy them and if you enjoy the music of Chopin, I would recommend these mp3 downloads to you. The CDs are expensive and hard to find. The mp3s are cheap and readily available.

I would recommend starting with volume 1 & 7. Volume one includes Koczalski's final commercial recordings, made shortly before he died in 1948, the first of a projected set of recordings of all of Chopin's major works. It is posterity's loss that he died shortly after making these recordings because these are the finest of all his recordings, commercial or radio broadcast. Volume seven includes a 35 minute broadcast recital celebrating Chopin's 138th birthday with Koczalski playing 7 compositions on Chopin's piano, plus other broadcast recordings. Those 7 tracks may be the best opportunity we have of hearing what Chopin playing his own music sounded like not only because of Koczalski's training with Chopin's favorite pupil, but also because he was playing Chopin's own piano, though I must confess, I prefer the sound of the modern pianos heard on of the other recordings. Volume one also includes modern performances of some of Koczalski's compositions played by another pianist (starting with track 15).

In volume seven, the last few tracks are not Chopin, but Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor (""Moonlight""), Paderewski Nocturne for piano in B flat major, Op. 16/4, Paderewski Mlodie for piano in G flat major, Op. 16/2, Paderewski Menuet clbre, Koczalski's Impromptu in A major, Op. 124, and Scherzo, Op. 131/5.  If you like these two volumes, you will probably want the other 5 volumes in the series and you should also try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koczalski-Plays-Chopin-Broadcast-Recordings-from-German-Radio-1945-1948/dp/B00700QH9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koczalski Plays Chopin - Broadcast Recordings from German Radio (1945 & 1948)</a>.  You may also find my review of that album informative, and CD sound is superior to mp3.  Volumes 2-6 of the Selene series are mostly reissues of Koczalski's commercial recordings in the 1930s or 1928 (volume 6) and they mostly don't quite attain the extremely high level of volume 1 & 7 and the other recommended CD, but there is nothing else like them and they are also excellent."
"Not a Jarre album but a selection of others' work <SEP> The songs of this album are not composed by Jean-Michel Jarre but by other musicians. In my opinion, the quality is fairly poor and the album doesn't live up to the standard established by Jarre. At the time of writing this review, the songs can be listened on Jarre's official website - I'd advise all would-be buyers to do so to avoid buying something unexpected."
"Awesome CD <SEP> This was a surprise to see Emerson Drive release a new cd since ""What If ?""  but they made a comeback and this is there best cd ever released.  It's a great buy for anybody."
"Love it!!!! <SEP> I love this album. I've been a fan since almost the beginning.  You should buy this album.  If you liked their other albums, you'll love this one too.  If this is your first time listening the Emerson Drive, then check out their other albums as well.  I love all the songs, but one of favorites is ""With You."""
"Makes me laugh <SEP> This man can tell a tale. I like his story telling CD's best but the music is good too. ""The too Late Lounge"" is one of my favorites plus ""Me & Stover; The Red Mule"""
cool <SEP> cool
Terrible. <SEP> A Single loop 4 or 5 times. No changes in key or instrumentation. Boo to Amazon for not giving you enough demo to find this out!
Great <SEP> Amazon does an amazing job at getting digital media out to people fast and easy. Love the mp3 format to go with most all players.
One Star <SEP> This is a collection of already released songs with the wrong names.
"Not really an instrumental, or even a cover ""I Want To Be Your Man"" <SEP> Sad to say, but they missed the mark on this one big time. First of all, it has a ton of talkbox vocals all over it. In fact, it STARTS OUT with talkbox which is totally wrong. This song is supposed to start with a bass and twinkly synth intro, then go straight into the verse. This version starts with a chorus, and then has a ton of talkbox in the verse that isn't even in the original.

Essentially what it sounds like is whoever made this track just bought a talkbox for the first time, didn't spend a lot of time honing in their sound to get that classic Roger ""Golden Voice"" Troutman talkbox quality (maybe your average joe wouldn't even know, but I'm a bit of a talkbox geek), and then tried to remake a version of ""I want to be your man"" but added their own spin on it.

Poorly done. Sorry for being harsh but I'm just not happy at all for having spent any amount of money on this track. I suppose that's what I get for not listening to the preview first. My fault I know."
"The song only downloaded the frist 10 seconds <SEP> And even that sounds crappy , I wouldn't wast your time or money on this song. I was really disappointed"
I don't like this music. <SEP> grand kid did this I do not like this type of music.but where one of my grandkids love all thpys
"NOT a karaoke MP3 <SEP> The MP3 version is not MP3 + G.  There are no lyrics for your karaoke system.  The CD is labelled CDG, so I assumed the MP3 would be the same."
"Awe Inspiring <SEP> Recently I watched The Tenors on a PBS re-broadcast of their Las Vegas show.  It was filled with soaring, heart-felt vocals that brought tears to my eyes several times during the perfromance.  ""Lead With Your Heart"" is clearly the song that rockets the album into the stratosphere of male vocals, however my favorites are ""Forever Young"" and ""Anchor Me"".  And of course, ""Nessun Dorma"" - what a performance!

The four men all have very different voices, each given a chance to shine throughout the album.  It has a nice mix of power-pop, and classical-influences.  Each of these men could easily be on Broadway in ""Les Miz"" or ""Phantom"".

My only gripe is adding ""special guests"" and choruses.  The femal vocalist on ""Amazing Grace"" (an award-winning ""gospel"" singer) adds nothing to the performance.  The same can be said for the choruses.  They can hardly be heard, so why even add them?

Overall, a great album."
la musica maravillosa de mexico <SEP> i would like to know the name of the songs contained on this cd`s. i can`t comit to buy something if i don`t know what it is on it. also i can`t rate it lacking the knowledge of such product
Stunning! <SEP> These are such tremendously talented young men.  Their vocal blending and vocal range gives me chills; a joy to listen to!
Five Stars <SEP> amazing song!
"Hot mess <SEP> I think that the CD as a whole is not good, although my wife likes the single cause she followed the television program.  If it was not for that I would be like Day who?  But anyhow, they need a new flow to the entire CD something that flows and is enriching."
"Beautiful! <SEP> Love Daniel Rodriguez and his rendition of ""Into the Fire."" He sang it in Augusta, Georgia on July 4th, 2017."
"boring, zero creativity and originality <SEP> Generic, boring, zero creativity and originality. Sounds like hundreds other death metal bands."
"NOT Public Domain - do not purchase for use in Youtube videos <SEP> This music is not public domain. Use of these tracks on Youtube will get your videos flagged for copyright claims which means you cannot benefit from video monetization.

After the third strike (in a row) I just trashed the entire album. Unfortunately, there is no refund process on Amazon for digital purchases."
"Best Cover I've Heard <SEP> Okay, I've listened to a few other covers of Somerville's classic, but Corr's is probably the best performance.  Her voice is clear and well trained.  Sounds like she means what she sings too.  Instrumentation is beautiful.  First rate job!"
Lively and Upbeat <SEP> Sharon Corr does her Irish music heritage proud and then some with this polished and perfectly delivered instrumental piece.  Highly recommended!
Two Stars <SEP> Liked a different version better.
Not the best <SEP> They don't provided the selection of songs. Not the best from Lola Flores
"Cinematic Piano <SEP> This CD is wonderful - so great, in fact, that I purchased another for a good friend. It's the kind of music that one never tires of."
"THIS DISC IS FALSE <SEP> I am a HUGH Toscanini admirer, and the reason I give this disc 1 star (there are no ""0"" stars) is because, first-I did not buy it and because, from my research, these performances never took place on the dates said.. This disc is false. The Beethoven is from the 1939 Beethoven cycle, and the other 2 items are from ""who knows where""! The Force of Destiny WAS played on the broadcast of 11/8/52, and the only time Toscanini broadcast the Luisa Miller Overture was from 7/25/43. So take your chances, but I wouldn't get it. If anyone can prove me wrong, I will humbly apologize."
Goooooooood <SEP> Very good album
Five Stars <SEP> great song to sing
"great song. <SEP> Glad to see you think because I bought it that i acually received it. Not!  It shows up as her big hit Downtown, but it's not there either, fine because I already own it on a full alban. Asked my more capable son to trouble shoot it for me. He first thought I just thought I bought it. Then when he could see the artist listed with the different song, stated well thats why you don't bother trying to buy songs through them. His suggestion was, buy the cd from the store and put in on your computer, if you really wany it."
"Very disappointing <SEP> This album was cut at the peak of Nash's creative powers, between ""Hold Me Tight"" and ""I Can See Clearly Now,"" when this great African-American singer was recording in Jamaica.  It should have been magnificent, but it's completely pedestrian.  Indeed, it's so bad, it's almost mysterious.  What the hell went wrong?"
"Good Music <SEP> Solid music and quite good. It's worth getting. Preview the sound like you can on Amazon, and if is a style that you like then buy it! Listen to Wildish."
My favorite contemporary compilation of French chansons! <SEP> Every track a winner!  I am a big fan of French chansons (both by original artists like Brassens and Piaf and contemporary interpretations too);  and this is one of my absolute favorite CDs of  the latter group.  Patrick Nugier's mellow vocals on a number of these songs are to die for!  Highly recommended!
One Star <SEP> Very small
Five Stars <SEP> Good music
"It's okay <SEP> I think I just had ""country"" in mind since Loretta Lynn was the one I originally heard do it......I prefer her version."
The sample is the Mansion House in the Heart meditation ... <SEP> The sample is the Mansion House in the Heart meditation. I want the Conveyor Belt meditation. How do I get that one?
"Love these bells <SEP> The sounds of these bells are wonderful for my cell phone. I use it for my text messages, and the sound is soothing and charming to the ears. Long lasting for those that are not connected 24/7 to their phones but a clear tone to hear a message from across the room. I highly recommend for anyone that loves bells or a close replicated sound of the salvation army volunteers at Christmas."
Lonely Blue Boy DV <SEP> Had many songs I had never have heard.....probably songs early in his career.. about three songs I enjoyed that were some of his most popular
"Not the original recording <SEP> It is just OK, I would have rather have the original recordings from back in the late 70's or early 80's, These versions are remaster and quite slow. If you want the original versions, I do not recommend this at all."
"Great meaningful song <SEP> Wonderful, touching, some what haunting song. Every time I or my wife hear it start playing we stop in our tracks and listen!"
This is a rip off because the songs are overplayed and not that good <SEP> This album was put together with out much thought to being goods songs to work out too.  It consisted of all overplayed tunes you really don't want to hear again.  Workout songs should be ones you can not wait to get to the gym to hear. None of the songs on this album fit that description.
Happy <SEP> it is a very good cry in your beer song to help with the grieving process of losing the love of your life. I love the song she describes the hurt very well.
Great Song For Hurricane Sandy Relief <SEP> This song was written. For the Victims of hurricane sandy and the lyrics speak for itself. Beautiful Song about Coming together when a disaster hits! Great Song!!
"THIS IS NOT A KARAOKE ALBUM <SEP> I thought because it said stuido musicians and because the album resembles ITUNE's Karaoke Album cover, that I was purchasing the Karaoke Version..... NOT!"
Awesome tunes! They're great to see live too <SEP> Awesome tunes!  They're great to see live too!
"Awesome Band <SEP> Crankshaft has been pounding the pavement since 2008, developing his own ""pork neck"" style along the way. A sound heavily rooted in rock 'n' roll, blues, country, swing, and surf that ""could not have been imagined prior to the early punk scene,"" as described by Dig In Magazine. Rock solid original lyrics, a dedicated fan base, and his 21st century twist on the American roots is pushing him to the top of the crowded Minneapolis music scene in a hurry. It's becoming clear to many that Crankshaft is ""one of the best and most interesting roots, rock and blues acts playing around town these days."" - Cities 97"
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"Exquisite! <SEP> This is an absolutely stunning and equisite cd of piano music.  I have his other CDs and listen to them often while working, cooking, chilling out. 'Bonnie Sue' is one of my favorites on the album."
"Many tracks are not complete <SEP> Many of the tracks end abruptly before they are actually finished. Also, one of the tracks you can clearly hear someone coughing in the background. Otherwise, the songs are good."
ANOTHER LYRICAL GENIOUS <SEP> REAL
"killer track <SEP> killer track, these guys kick ass! If you like old school heavy metal then you should definitely check this out!"
Five Stars <SEP> good quality audio - great memories of an extremely well done show
Five Stars <SEP> Fun song
"Poor Sound Quality <SEP> I bought this album because I'm very nostalgic about the Hans Christian Anderson & Tubby The Tuba album my family had when I was a kid and this album has exactly the same songs. Amazon also has the title I listed above, but I bought this one because it was a dollar less. Unfortunately the sound quality is not very good -- kind of has a muffled and echo-y sound. Listening to the samples, the other collection of the same songs sounds like it has better sound quality. I wish I'd checked that out first and bought the other version for a dollar more!"
"Remember The Name <SEP> This up and coming artist combines blues, great guitar, and a soulful voice in a compilation of songs I'm glad to add to my collection...and you will too."
Two Stars <SEP> Disappointing.
"Poorly Produced <SEP> This album seems to be poorly produced, voices are off key and it reminds me of something that was recorded on a taperecorder then uploaded on a computer for digital reproduction, not what I expected at all."
"Music for your heart, soul and when you wanna get pumped up! <SEP> I love all of their music and their live show is something never to miss! The synergy between all of them is something that provides deep emotion between the band and their fans. The songs cut to the heart and get a crowd pumping! I love the balance their music brings to my life."
great blues <SEP> fantastic vocals smooth sax whats not to like about hot mess!!! If you lioke sax and the blues this CD is for you!!
"dissapointing <SEP> pales in comparison to the epic 2011 mix.  a lot of long winded, very uninteresting songs that are immediately forgetable."
"Moving <SEP> I was looking for a way to support the families of Newtown and this was a perfect way to do both that, as well as, have a beautiful song performed by beautiful children."
Mario stepping out of the box! <SEP> Mario is an extraordinary classical crossover singer.  He is also extremely versatile and creative. The song explores all the different ways Mario uses his talent.  It's no wonder he is always in the Top Ten artists on classical-crossover.co.uk!
"I love Webby! This song is ok <SEP> Webby's a great upcoming rapper. This song was a nice idea and it became a really sweet result. Glad to see Webby is still an artist who thinks/cares about more important things in life as well as having fun. Like it or not, this is art.

God bless the victims of Sandy Hook and their families."
Five Stars <SEP> excellence
"Better Than White Noise Generator <SEP> I burned this MP3 to a CD and play it on an endless loop to block the grinding, noisy a/c contraption that a neighbor keeps on constantly.  But it also gives my living space a sensation of nature indoors even though the sound seems to be artificial rather than sampled from a ""real"" seashore.  But for .99 this item is much cheaper than having a fountain consuming space and electricity.  I won't say that this recording causes me to relax.  But if you run it through headphones at low volume, it will lull you to sleep and you'll be refreshed."
Five Stars <SEP> the whispers are just awesome.
Two Stars <SEP> Not actually T-Rex and I was disappointed
Five Stars <SEP> Great R&B
Five Stars <SEP> This song pays homage to your lady and reassures her of her place in you life
very poor sound quality <SEP> Worse sound quality I have every heard. Sounds like someone recorded it from the radio to a tape drive.
"bizzare album, just listen to the previews <SEP> Idk how to explian how bizarre this album is. It's a bunch of random Christmas songs from the 1950s and 60s, mixed in with a bunch of random kpop songs from 2007-2012. The Christmas songs have nothing to do with Korea or today's pop music and the kpop has nothing to do with Christmas. There are kpop stars that covered Christmas songs and there are a some korean contemporary Christian artists so why doesn't this album have ANY of those songs?
UPDATE: after listening to more of the album, these kpop songs aren't the original. It's like karaoke or something."
"Good Luck finding the real thing! <SEP> If you think this is the song that you were looking for, you have been duped.  This is a remake and a pretty horrible one at that.  I can't believe this dreadful lugubrious turd is even here.  But try finding the real and original version of this (and many others) song to download...  Good Luck and keep trying!"
Four Stars <SEP> Smooth
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song!  I'm so happy I found it on Amazon's MP-3 Digital Music Website!  Thank You!
Five Stars <SEP> Love Steve Wariner and this song is definitely one of my favorites
"BEST!! <SEP> Love this singer.  He has a clear, smooth voice. This version of Caruso is one of the best there is."
"One Star <SEP> Only listen to this if you have had a frontal lobotomy, and have all the DeathClok albums."
"Is this for real??? <SEP> It must really take a lot of talent to make this kind of noise.  I shouldn't be shocked but I am.  This is horrible, disgusting and degrading to humans as a species.  I would say we might as well be animals but I believe they are even better than this. Unbelievable! I know there are different genres of music but this should be classified as trash plain and simple.  Scary! I mean, wow!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love this happy song!
"Great music, but not of winds. <SEP> I bought this recording hoping to hear some great recorder consort music. I was sadly very disappointed. While there is a few tracks that are recorder consort, most of the recording was of harpsichord, organ, or lute (guitar?). Of the 22 tracks 3 (maybe 4) where recorder consort and 1 was recorder, lute, and voice. While I don't mind string and keyboard instruments, I would expect a CD recorded by ""The Royal 'Wind' Music"" to be mostly WIND music. Musically all of the musicians are excellent and give great performances (with perhaps the one exception, the Byrd ""Ave Verum Corpus"" which is played using very harsh organ stops). Even the picture of the ensemble has them holding recorders with not picture of any other instruments."
Rare <SEP> $600 isn't completely unreasonable. It's an extremely rare album. I wouldn't pay that for a used copy but a new unopened copy would be well worth it.
"Not all B-52s Sound Alike. <SEP> Doesn't seem be a very good recording.  Clarity, ramping, etc.  I expected something a little more realistic similar to the sound tracks of the fighter aircraft leaving the carrier deck from the Navy's excellent PBS aired Carrier series.  This recording doesn't capture the ear puncturing uniqueness of the 8 mega engines anchored to the many feet deep metal reinforced concrete by 488,000 pounds of the ""fully"" loaded E and F model aircraft.  We who worked with this majestic lethal monster can't forget the extremely intense high pitched scream that wailed just almost out of human hearing range.  If you spent much time without appropriate sound protection gear it would begin to soften - meaning that the ear damage was reaching the point where the ear no longer functioned at that frequency.  On the opposite end of the frequency range the ground rumbled such that the sound came through your feet and pressure changes in the air.  I was especially effected by the sound deep in the night when there was a lot of moisture in the air.  We were in the ""no fly zone"" in the middle of the New Mexico desert so a 2 or 3 o'clock take off or landing under an otherwise silent desert for as far as you could see took on a surreal mind warping beauty especially when you understood the ""extreme"" destructive power  that a set of B-52 alert aircraft carried.  I suspect that there are no quality recordings (any recordings at all)  of the NM Desert B-52s as the security rings were layered and the slightest mishap could turn into a nightmare I mean like trained packs of loose roving German Shepherd dogs, etc., or getting the crap beat out of you for not understanding ""No"".  A photographic device or anything that even resembled recording gear would get you into deep-deep trouble with immediate retaliation.  Just a small handful of individual mistakes could automatically trigger a full national retaliatory launch."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!!
"Five Stars <SEP> i love this album, very soulful. Susan is a fantastic vocalist"
"Missing link <SEP> Not as good as the first British Lions LP, but still good. Don't like the BBC commercials. Too bad this band didn't stay together, but then we probably would not have had Box of Frogs. Glad to have tunes from a band that I never thought I'd hear again"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Excellent Tunes <SEP> I had Lowside's 3 song Demo & have been waiting for this CD to drop. Great new rock songs on this Debut CD, all 11 songs ROCK!"
They don't make music like this anymore! <SEP> Love this song.
Five Stars <SEP> good music for sleeping
"Five Stars <SEP> great sound, nice and clear."
"NOT PRINCE - NOT PRINCE <SEP> How is it possible that this joker is listed as Prince? There is only one Prince.
Even if his name is Prince at least combine it with his surname, this is just ripping people off who don't look properly and purchase it thinking it is Prince Rogers Nelson, the only person that can just be called Prince."
Two Stars <SEP> It was ok.
Light bulb busting good!!! <SEP> I gave this and one other Cd from the same people to my boyfriend as a gift. He has this crazy system in his bedroom and when he played this it busted his light bulb in his ceiling. Amazing! I would say it pretty much did the job. Thanks!
"Love is a myth <SEP> Love is a myth. It is basically nature's way of helping human recreate. That sounds pretty negative and it is. Then songs like ""I Believe"" come out. We should be singing songs like this in church and restaurants and at work. To paraphrase""

""Now I believe there has been a change in me""
and
""It will all work out in time""

Here's to all of you that believe in love."
Clear and sharp <SEP> Great sound effect for a church activity with the kids.
Two Stars <SEP> Not great version
Five Stars <SEP> Love song
A BEAUTIFUL OLD SCHOOL SONG <SEP> Thank God I was able to locate this song. It is such a beautiful love ballad. This was one of my mama's favorite songs.
a trip back in time <SEP> This is a great version of this song and is my favorite version of the song after happening accross it on youtube. After hearing it I bought it on Amazon music. I just love it. Its very soulful and very much like the R and B music of the 60s.
18 tracks not 24 <SEP> BEWARE....only 18 tracks....not the 24 'Nuggets' printed on the cover. Unbelievable that they actually dropped 6 tracks from the CD and didn't even alter the '24 more boss Nuggets' to say 18 and still charged $9.49. I hope whoever made that decision doesn't make another dime.
Great! <SEP> Great 60s tune!
Great Little Tune by The Fireballs feat. Jimmy Gilmer came out in the Early to Mid-60's. <SEP> Great Little Tune by The Fireballs feat. Jimmy Gilmer came out in the Early to Mid-60's.
True golden oldie <SEP> Glad to find this old favorite at last! This is one of my favorite from long ago. And it is still as great as I recall!
"Ny kind of  music <SEP> It's hard get the music you p refer. Thanks Amazon, you""'re the best."
"Heart Reaching <SEP> This CD has songs for every age group.  The song Rescue Me really gets down in your heart.  It sends chills through you.  This is a must hear. Also, you must check out the video."
"The epitome of soulful blues. <SEP> I grew up in the 60's and thought I knew most musical artists from that era but James Carr is new to me.  I recently heard this song on the Showtime series, ""Counterpart"" and immediately bought it.  There is so much soul and sadness here which will ring true with anyone who has ever been in a similar situation."
never get old <SEP> my era  I love it just listen to the music n love it back in the day sound all about love.
"Poorest tribute attempt ever... <SEP> I bought this based on the assembled talent listed and boy was I disappointed. This CD has to be one of the worst mixed CD's I've ever heard. It's not even a good home studio recording. It just sounds ruined in the mix. Washed in reverb, overly heavy compression, and bad EQ it is hard to even listen to one song half way through. I'm embarrassed for the musicians that lent their talents to this blundered recording. While the performances are well played they are ruined in the mix. Whomever mixed this CD should be barred from ever mixing another recording. I only wish I could get a refund. It really is a shame that Led Zeppelin has to have their name on this tribute."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
Five Stars <SEP> love the music
"Ah, geez. <SEP> Wish I read the reviews before purchasing this. Terrible!"
DON'T BUY. ONKY 20 SECONDS WORTH <SEP> Onlu 20 seconds of music. DON'T BUY.
Too Short <SEP> Can't believe I wasted $1 for a 40 second song. Don't waste your money on this.
Only thirty seconds long <SEP> I kinda of expected this be pretty long but it is only 30 seconds and I think it was a waste buying this song
too short <SEP> It's too short even for 99 cents.  youo get into it and then it quits.  I expected the whole song. I probably won't get any more like this.
Disappointing <SEP> The sample was the whole song. Made me upset to see it in my album..I had to delete it. Don't buy.
"its not great <SEP> it was a 30 second song for 99 cent it should have been free this is a rip off.
i wouldnt buy this"
"the World is Just a ""B"" Movie In Deed! <SEP> Sorry Bob. This album sounds uninspired. it wasn't up there with the 2 you done for World Pecific and ""Since There Were Circles"" album. you are one of my all time favourite songwriters and I was disappointed with the music in this album. I award you one star because you're Bob Lind, but if you were not Bob Lind, you'd get negative 100 stars for this. your old recordings may live on. nice try."
"only 30 seconds, abrupt stop <SEP> Starts off really cool- but the preview is exactly the song- abruptly stops at 30 seconds in the ""middle"" (meaning it doesn't sound like it's supposed to end). AmazonMP3 app didn't show how long it was when I bought it. I feel cheated and annoyed,"
Backstrokin one of the best Jams of the 80's <SEP> I was searching the internet looking for some old jams for my 50th birthday saw this and need to have it!!!! Love it
One Star <SEP> great
Five Stars <SEP> Good old time soul music
Mr. Thomas and his two cohorts DID NOT WRITE ... <SEP> Mr. Thomas and his two cohorts DID NOT WRITE this song. THEY STOLE IT! This is PLAGIARISM! This song was written by Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico for The Animals in 1965. Shame on Timmy Thomas! SHAME!!!
Five Stars <SEP> I loved this cd.
Great! <SEP> Couldn't be happier. Great collection.
"It's like everything came together for them on this one song <SEP> The standard, shorter version of this song is from the Boogie Nights soundtrack. And it's the only song worth mentioning from this band. I listened to most everything they released on streaming music services, and could not get behind any of it. Then I found this extended remix version. It's like everything came together for them on this one song. I'm not saying it's particularly good, but this is why I like it: driving beat that's not disco, electronic-sounding bass line, that slowly-strummed chord sounds like a chime, the drone of the main guitar lick, the echo on the voices. There's no sleaze or smoke, just crisp nighttime."
LOVE <SEP> Always loved this album
"Don't bother, get another album instead <SEP> Really disappointed I bought this.  It's really good, but it's only 5 songs when I thought it was a full album.  Plus, it doesn't have any new songs, only things taken from other albums so nothing new here.  It doesn't even include the song for the opening credits of the show.  I love the Sats but their record company got it wrong with this one."
Pop Perfection <SEP> The Sats have made a great first start in the states! I am so excited for where their music will go.
Five Stars <SEP> Great R&B from a time when R&B was truly trancendent.
"Download issues <SEP> I never got the download. When I check my cloud of music, it is not listed. Something is wrong with this song."
All of the Day And I love real Henchmen VI <SEP> Brings back good memories my brother was a member of the Henchmen vi I used to sit on the basement stairs listening to them practice  gave me goosebumps to hear All of the day and is love real again
"good old school EBM <SEP> Reminds me of Nitzer Ebb and Front line assembly sortish stuff.  Makes me happy! It's mid-tempo dark aggro. I like ""distract"", ""never know"" and ""black halo"""
"great album. <SEP> 2012 SG, Suzuka's last year, great album."
Great Sakura Gakuin album! <SEP> This is my first sakura gakuin album and let me tell you this was great! I was quite worried that I wouldn't like it but now I'm in love with the sakura gakuin group. This is a must buy!
"Great Music and Artists <SEP> Great music for Freestyle lovers. It brought back many memories. The artists featured perform the song very nicely. I especially loved ""Let the Music Play,"" and I thought the new featured artist (""Gina C."") brought it back to life!"
One Star <SEP> I don't know what this is.  I didn't order it.  I hope I didn't get charged for it.
"beautiful and touching music! <SEP> I met Mr Tretick at Downtown Disney in Anaheim and this song was one of the songs that he played that night. Comparing with the guitar and piano versions of this song, this version is the best in my opinion. It was much better when he played it live, but I'm so glad that I found the studio version here."
"Great 90's Freestyle Tune <SEP> Without sounding too old skool, I do wish tunes today were like the tunes of the 90's.  Great bass line and beat that gets ya doin' the running man in no time at all  ;)"
Two Stars <SEP> It's ok
Very poor quality product <SEP> Very poor quality product. The cd isn't working at all ats I write this. Would like a refund or a better quality cd.
"Morton Gould Coffee Time <SEP> This reissue sounds, at times, like an LP rip with a few clicks, pops and skips here and there. Very poor quality.  Not the first time I found junk like this on Amazon and likely not the last."
"This is NOT a ""Just Dance"" video game.  The advertising was very misleading! <SEP> I ordered this thinking it was a ""Just Dance"" video game.  The price was certainly the same as a video game would have been.  I have absolutely no use for an audio only CD of music I've never heard of."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
Beautiful Song <SEP> Beautiful song! Put it on repeat and listen for hours! The words are so true!
"Awesome folk sound in Christian pop <SEP> Plumb redid her style of music a bit on this album so that it's not so ""dark"" feeling. I love, love, love this new album.  Light and fun, but then others are deep and soulful.  Nice mix."
Five Stars <SEP> Good Christian music.
Five Stars <SEP> A very good song.
Four Stars <SEP> Love Plumb
Not all of the song <SEP> The recording is fine and it is the expected cut from this album but it is missing the final two questions so it is useless.  You expect when you buy a song that you get the song not the first half of the song.  Really disappointed in not getting what I expected which is the complete song.  Kind of like buying a 99 cent hamburger and only getting the bun.
"This is by far the best album collection of the Kinks <SEP> This is by far the best album collection of the Kinks. The first three sides are sensational. The fourth side is still good but not as strong as the other three sides. If you love the kinks, get this album. I have it on vinyl. I want to find it on digital."
World famous for a reason <SEP> Superb.  The voices and music blend so very well
"Even the Beatles were impressed! <SEP> How can you get 20 Beatles references in a 2 minute song by the Beatles ""You Can't Do That"". Paul McCartney and John Lennon were so impressed with this they both wrote letters to Mr. Nilsson."
"Early go at a medley of Beatles' songs <SEP> Nilsson's version of ""You Can't Do That"" (a somewhat lesser-known Beatles' tune from the early years of their success) predated Sir George Martin's mash of their songs on the album LOVE by 40 years. It is indeed ""You Can't Do That"", but with bits and pieces of many other early Beatles' songs thrown in. If you know the songs being referenced, it is quite an enjoyable little nugget."
"Dave Digs Doo-Doo <SEP> Having listened to Brubeck in most of his iterations since 1958 (and having gone out and even purchased his early works, including those on the red vinyl Fantasy label), I was deeply disappointed by this. Perhaps it was the title, bringing to mind  ""Jazz Impressions of Japan.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-Impressions-Of-Japan/dp/B0018Q4D9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz Impressions Of Japan</a>. Regardless the reason, I simply could not bring myself to like this CD, even after several playings. I honestly hoped for better and wish it had turned out other than it did."
Another Disappointment <SEP> Go forth and be more charismatic and flirty. When you are with your partner touch them with purpose and meaningfulness. Now that you know what is on the dated CD you can save your money. There are three MP3s on the CD dated 1994 and I sincerely doubt they were popular when released. This is another cost/aggravation where the aggravation wins and the CD is going straight to the trash as I don't see it worth my time and trouble to send it back.
One Star <SEP> Not what I wanted
Two Stars <SEP> Wouldn't download
Best album ANYWHERE <SEP> I LOVE THIS ENTIRE CD!!!!!  My life is complete now that I have this..... 5 FOR GAMMA GAMMA RAY.  I LOVE THE CREEPS!
GREAT MUSIC <SEP> First saw the group on youtube & loved it there. VERY excited to find their album on Amazon. I really like it.
One Star <SEP> Terrible
Kik stand movement <SEP> The album is really good! Has dope beats and very strong message of staying consistent in our relationships with God!
"CONFUSED <SEP> I didn't understand the term ""loops"" before I ordered."
Relaxing <SEP> Very relaxing music for my grandson and my husband. They both fall asleep 
"Exactly how that could be true... <SEP> ""You say I quit my job and then I drank myself insane...""  I had no idea anyone else had ever been so miserable. I didn't hear the song until I was well established in a successful AA program. Before that, for me it was magic markers, not crayons; but he has it nail-on-the-head down pat."
One Star <SEP> That was not music.
"The newest version on the Americana music scene. <SEP> The unique and original Americana music of the David Luning Band, is electric with bold talent,  and keeps the listener entertained  and energized."
"Not the soundtrack from the HPLHS film <SEP> The pieces on this recording are OK as mood music.  Stylistically, they're a pastiche of recent horror-movie soundtracks, and they offer little (perhaps nothing?) in the way of original ideas.  The performance is executed electronically, with some clumsy transitions.

As far as I can tell, the soundtrack from the silent film distributed by the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society is not available in MP3 format."
"A great ethereal piece of art! <SEP> Ethereal, haunting, dark, moody, and slightly erotic in a purely Cthulhu sort of way! I really recommend this if you in any way loved the film."
"NOT RADIO VERSION <SEP> I quickly downloaded this to play for my students.  We were studying Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, and I thought this song perfectly captures Cash's personality.  As it played, I hardly recognized it as the John Conlee song I love.  It must be a live version of a really bad performance.  Ugh."
"forever to go <SEP> I just love Elvis Barker, a pipeliner from Louisiana, if you read his background, you will have to purchase all of his music, with him loosing his home to a fire, and loosing his wife to cancer, please buy his music! One great man, thank you for his music, thank you amazon!"
"Fabulous voice, Amazing guitar <SEP> Just one voice and one guitar.  No effects.  Simple and uncluttered, but masterfully performed.  This is a GREAT version of one of John Lennon's GREATEST songs with the Beatles.  Anissa Caprina's voice and delivery are haunting, absolutely perfect for this song.  The guitar solo by Illo Djeer is particularly impressive and inspired."
"Fresh Sound <SEP> Muscovy are Danny Johnson and Tom Smart, an acoustic duo from Lincoln, England.

The sound of Muscovy could be described as rhythmic guitar-based with subtle and intricate guitar melodies. A raw acoustic vibe, occasionally delving into sleepy ambience, with soft vocals and ghostly harmonies.

I just listened to the EP and enjoyed it very much. Sounds a bit like the band ""Iron and Wine"" on the vocal side.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Creek-Drank-The-Cradle/dp/B000YMY0E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Creek Drank The Cradle</a>

Not bad for a first listen. Easy listening enjoyment."
"NOT ROYALTY FREE <SEP> We purchased this package as a documentary, film and television ROYAL-FREE song but it is NOT.

After all the work we placed into a documentary that was placed in YouTube.com, the owner was forcing us to pay for the use of the song through the advertising revenue.  We are disputing it with YouTube.com but it is certainly a big problem after productions is done."
One Star <SEP> Not good
"Highly Underrated Band & Album <SEP> I just bought this CD at The Emerson in Beech Grove for $10 and got a free t-shirt with the band's name on it. I honestly did not expect the album to be that great for only $10 with a shirt as well as being from a band I had not heard of. Man what a surprise, this band is good. I really like their songs. They are especially talented as far as the instruments go. If you like rock or metal bands at all I would buy this album."
One Star <SEP> GREAT
"Insipid. Boring. Time waster. <SEP> Insipid. Boring. Time waster.

Pied Piper of Nonsense & Delusion."
The author blocks usage on YouTube even after you purchased ... <SEP> The author blocks usage on YouTube even after you purchased the song.  I bought it and they only allow the use of the song on YouTube.com only if they get the advertising money from YouTube.  It is clear NOT a royalty free tune.
"When God and good music come together <SEP> In just the few hours since I've downloaded this project, I have been truly blessed. Each song has been like a mini-sermon ministering into my LIFE. I am glad this is a digital download because if it were a record or tape I would probably wear it out."
Everyone needs to buy this album <SEP> Beautiful album and very inspiring. Many blessings to this great artist and I highly. recommend for everyone to purchase it.
One Star <SEP> Boring and not interesting
One Star <SEP> Very simple
"I can't stop listing to this song! <SEP> KeyRingz are from my home town. I remember hearing KeyRingz on the radio in Reno (I think it was wild 102.9). I was a little home sick so I looked them up, and I am not disappointed. If you let it, this song and album will alter everything you understand about the world.
I'm just typing now because amazon has a word count. So this is me typing to meet that word count... And some more words go here and the count goes up and up until you are free to post.

Good Job KeyRingz
Looking forward to what you release next.
-Travis"
"You just have to hear it for yourself. <SEP> Their music envelopes you and provides a temporary escape to a musical oasis. Their other albums, particularly the MTV Unplugged one, are even better if you can rate any better."
A uniquely talented artist <SEP> I have had the great privilege of seeing Nina Storey live several times in Colorado and I find that this album reflects her unique charm and incredible talent in a powerful way. I absolutely love this album and listen often. Highly recommended!
"Her Best Yet! <SEP> I have purchased all of Jeni""s albums over the years.  This is the best!  Great to have a variety of excellent musicians backing her up."
Fun son <SEP> I needed a song for a school project and my dad is from Nebraska so I got this song and it is really funny and fun to listen too. It is a catchy tune.
Five Stars <SEP> Good
"Beautiful album <SEP> Sheila Down is a phenomenal album. Start to finish it is filled with captivating sounds and talent. The band is great and the performance from Sheila is some of the most passionate female vocals I have ever heard.

Plus it has probably the best Neil Young cover to date. Wish I could have payed more!"
NO VOICE <SEP> COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS
"How could you go wrong <SEP> How could you go wrong with this classic and on top of it being a classic, it is song by a classy man.  Oh so some and beautiful I love it!"
"Mr. Jazz <SEP> Amazing!!  Every track is amazing and in English.  I am able to sing along with some of my favorite old jazz tunes and some of the old love ballads from the '70's.  Jam Hsiao has such a great voice and this CD is comparable to listening to other artists singing old jazz tunes, like Rod Stewart (I think I prefer Jam Hsaio's version better).  I would recommend this CD for anyone wanting to listen to the old jazz favorites sung by a new artist from China."
"DO NOT BUY <SEP> At one point not that long ago the comments on this review were alive with Shane's idiotic family threatening to kill me for this review. Looks like they've all been removed.

Let me be clear about something, I work in cancer research now, I'm not proud of what I said below, but I was angry at being ripped off for s sub par product, young and in the semester I purchased this. I vented. That said, threatening to kill someone is never funny. Mr. Newville, should you ever read this again, screw you and your disgusting family.

This album is a total rip off, the tracks are priced like premium content when they are absolutely not worth it. Out of all the tracks on this ""album"" 4 are 2 minutes of plug music, and the other 3 are nothing but 30 second samples. I expected when when this jackass put his work up on iTunes and Amazon that these tracks from the video would have been fully fleshed out and professionally filtered. They are not, and as such are a complete and total waste of your money. As an artist myself, I love to support other artists whether they are more successful than I am or not. Talent deserves to be fostered. Because of that deep connection and loyalty to the artistic community I get extremely angry when abused for my willingness to give. I will never buy anything from Roosterteeth ever again because of their affiliation with this dubious product. I paid cash for every DVD of RvB and was readily waiting for Monty to some day finish DF where I could purchase it as well as watching his RWBY series. Not anymore.

I hope Mr. Newville has a son who gets lukemia."
"Depressed Sound Quality <SEP> I'm ashamed to admit that I actually this LP. Irritating factors build up over the decades. It was not recorded by Rudy Van Gelder and had  rather weak, though listenable sound quality. It probably has the same sound as Harold Land's THE PEACEMAKER, with Bobby, released by Cadet Records in 1968."
"This is a good jazz record but questionable Capitol 75th Anniversary reissue vinyl LP. <SEP> I have a collection of some Bobby Hutcherson with Harold Land on CD.  I have seen & met Bobby before at Jazz Showcase in Chicago many years ago and was friends of friends of Harold (RIP) who are dead now, but that's the way it goes.  This was the last one I didn't have that I'm aware of, other than some possible later-day imports.  Their collaborations started in the mid-1960s and continued off and on until at least 10 or more years ago until Harold died.

But when I got this LP I was seriously disappointed with the vinyl quality.  It is a reasonably heavy LP but when you look at it, you see all kinds of clouds in the vinyl pressing, and the first one had a bunch of pits & flaws, and both had a skip.  Just like the old MCA vinyl pressings from the 1980s (not to just knock MCA) but corporate vinyl can really suck sometimes, and this is one of those things.  But surface noise is a big annoyance on what I thought might be a good new reissue vinyl LP.

I did return the LP and Amazon did do a good job of getting me a replacement copy pretty quickly.  The second one was better than the first but not what it should be for what current vinyl buyers expect, especially for jazz.

The music is pretty good.  Some good soloing by Harold & Bobby, and it ranges from post- bop to a bit of avant-garde without going too far out to get boring.

It is a great jazz LP for what you'd expect from these musicians but turns out, the vinyl (in a generic Blue Note 75th Anniversary sleeve) is nothing but another corporate disappointment.

I will have to also add, recently I bought from my local record store, the 180g 2-LP set of the ""Smile Sessions"" by the Beach Boys.  I used to like the recordings and know the story but turns out, that vinyl I bought was as flawed as my first one of this, and I had to return it for a refund.  What is up with EMI/Capitol vinyl these days?  Don't they get it that people care about quality vinyl?"
"you probably already know this is a great song, performed excellently <SEP> If you're looking at this, you probably already know this is a great song, performed excellently. This download is the genuine, original recording, in very good sound."
"Great songs, disappointing arrangement, uninspired performance <SEP> I really like both Mr. Neville and the song selection on this CD, but I was disappointed.  These are group songs, and on most of them the group (which consists of some very talented and revered singers from the 50s) are mixed down to where they may as well have stayed home.  That's a crying shame.  Aaron sings like Aaron sings -- very pretty, but formulaically.  I suggest you listen to samples and download your favorite 4 or 5 cuts. That's what I did."
This Magic Moment <SEP> Another great hit for Aaron Neville's gold voice.  Love this song. Love his voice! Great deal. 4 more words required. lol
"Arcane and unpleasant idiom <SEP> I seldom discard a CD after listening, but I tossed this one into the trash without hesitation.  It features vocal calisthenics that don't amount to much other than a squandered effort by the singer."
"What is this? <SEP> it's one thing to say an album is bad. this release is downright annoying. quite possibly the most annoying release since Scott walker's ""Bish Bosch"" disc. somebody said they listen to this in their car? if this was playing in my car, the trip I was going on would be cut short. simply horrid. 1 star because it made me laugh although this is not a comedy record. Happy freakin Mother's Day."
"Wasn't what I had expected. <SEP> The music was very depressing. The movie music had lyrics, this didn't.,"
"Shhhhh . . . This is a Very Quiet Soundtrack <SEP> If you like subdued xylophones doing a good imitation of white noise, then this soundtrack is for YOU!  I fooled myself into thinking that
the soundtrack CD would contain the music we heard while watching the film, but no, except for one mopey, faux-Western piece this CD
is mostly just muted marimba jive, the auditory equivalent of too many quaaludes.  But there is this:  By the end of the CD, you'll either be sound asleep or
very very calm."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful!
Cannot be purchased <SEP> This album is only available in some kind of format for a computer. You cannot buy the album it only exists in some format not for high end stereo music lovers. This product is not available if you have a true audiophile home stereo.
"Bresh Rocks! <SEP> I first saw Thom Bresh years ago as a virtual youngster, performing on TV, doing imitations like Jim Nabors, Andy Griffith, Willie Nelson and others, never realizing he was the son of my guitar hero, Merle Travis. Years later, I saw him perform on TV with his Dad and the two of them were pure magic. Thom has many great cuts on this album, including the tribute song that he wrote about his father, ""Guitar in the Window."" This live in concert version of the song is much better than the standard release, as Thom adds some ""Travis"" pickin' toward the end, including Merle's ""I'll See You in My Dreams.""
I met Thom once in Nashville, after calling his home and inquiring as to the delivery of his new CD with Buster Jones, and he personally delivered it to me at my hotel! What a class act and truly great guy......his guitar pickin' is almost identical to his Dad's, but Thom adds his own licks, making it truly a masterwork. Highly recommended for all thumb-pickers out there."
"Dreary and slow <SEP> I've listened to the first three CDs and it sounds like dirge music.  I'm 42 and I think this might have appealed to my grandparents.  This is the most depressing interpretation of peace I've ever encountered.  I was going to wait until I'd heard the last three CDs to make this report but, I'm too disappointed with the first half."
"Just not what expected... <SEP> I love these old songs; however, the singers just aren't that good overall.  Some are good, and they are entertaining and fun to listen to.  But I would not purchase this again because of the mostly bad singers.  Those that are not good can carry a tune, but they do not have nice voices for the most part.  I believe that many of them are sincerely trying to sing for the Lord, but their voices just are not good enough to make a business of singing or an album.  A few are wailers, and they sound worse than a howling coyote.  This purchase was one of the most disappointing purchases I've made.  I expected much more, but it seems more like a collection of people who were wannabes than singers.  God bless them all, but some need another career instead of singing."
Love this. Really lifts my spirts from the first ... <SEP> Love this.  Really lifts my spirts from the first time I heard it.
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful music by Jason Crabb.  Contemporary Christian music.
"Wonderful CD <SEP> What can I say it's Jason Crabb whether he's singing ""solo"" or with his family ""the Crabb Family"" he is an amazing artist!!! I truly believe the whole family is anointed by God, and their love for Jesus rings in all that they do. Thank you Jason for I am always inspired by the music you sing, and lifting up our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. God Bless you and your love ones always...Amen"
"awesome <SEP> Jason Crabb delivers again... ""Give says it all... and the words to his whole CD are amazing...Truly God's word!! Awesome!!!"
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
"Good song, for the ""price"", ... Free.  Can't beat the price, may listen to it someday again, but then again... <SEP> Good song, for the ""price"", ... Free.  Can't beat the price, may listen to it someday again, but then again, so many songs, so little time!  Thanks Artist for allowing customer to have free music."
GOD AWFUL ALBUM! <SEP> Loved this bands 1st album. I was an awesome rocking album. This album is a completely different style. I can't understand for the life of me why this band would do this. I've seen bands try this over the years on occasion. They were just wet behind the ears with a great first album to their credit. This was a pretty brassy move by a band not yet established and it backfired on them.
Two Stars <SEP> bad!! I prefer thier first cd
"What the *bleep* happened? now they sound like a generic indie pop band. <SEP> Wow, what happened?
Seriously I loved the last album, Big Enough, Shake Me, Long Slow Drag are classics.
This is album is GARBAGE! Whoever produced it is really, really bad. It has that generic Indie Pop sound that every indie pop record has and its not meant for Hard Rock it just does not work. it sounds like The Stooges first album meets  meets Some generic indie band. IT IS AWFUL DO NOT BUY! Money talks and let it speak."
"Zero star effort... Utter garbage. <SEP> Nothing else needs to be said, this may be the worst album I've ever heard. It is certainly the most disappointing, and will be a career ending move I'm afraid. Seriously awful album, not a single redeeming quality, or a single song that even remotely resembles rock or the last album. I'm actually offended by this garbage. End."
"From best to worst <SEP> Worst collabiration of crap I've ever heard. This bands first release is unquestionably a hit on every track. I couldn't wait to hear this release and yet the only thing being released was the contents of my stomach. Is this even the same band or did the first band cash in by selling their name to some out of touch LSD inspired 60's band making their ""come back"" debut. I don't understand the disconnect here but, it is clear that Taddy Porter is well on their way to being a one and done band. Too bad! Oh, the only reason I left a star is because a turd wasn't available to publish this review."
"What a dud! <SEP> I had very high hopes for Taddy's second.  Their first album was such a great one! I thought i was a perfect record!  I previewed Stay Golden online and thought, ""it cant really be that bad!"" so I bought it regardless. Yes-It really was that bad! I liked one tune off it (just a little bit..) and that is it.  The entire album is very 'bubble-gum'.  I cant believe you can go from creating Such a gem to a dud like this.  Makes me think there was more to the story. (were they pressured to go in another direction?....See-I am still naively holding out hope that Taddy wouldn't INTEND on putting out something this terrible!!).  Phooey."
"Where's the meat? <SEP> Wow, like everyone else I have been crushed. We were lucky enough to see Taddy twice in concert before this happened. We saw them open for Saving Able and Jonathan Tyler. The shows were TOTALLY AWESOME, very high energy and kick ass rock n roll. We bought multiple copies of their first CD and gave them to friends, family and just about anyone we know who listens to rock n roll. We have been waiting for so long to get their 2nd CD.

What happened? It is very hard to believe this is the same group of guys. I bought a copy of this CD just to support the group. I can only hope that the old Taddy reemerges with the same fire, song writing and music ability that created their first CD. Heck, I hope after this CD they are together long enough to get a 3rd CD out.

There aren't that many times in life when things connect and you get a CD like Taddy's first CD. That CD is just super from song 1 through the entire thing. There are no bad songs. I'd be very happy with a CD half as good as that one was.

Anyway . . . just more of what everyone else had to say I guess."
not the band I originally liked <SEP> I hope that Taddy Porter gets back to the roots of their first album. The first album was amazing. This album is nothing like the band I originally seen in concert and I will no longer tout this band or buy their music if this is the garbage I am going to hear. Please Taddy Porter get back to you. This direction I believe is the wrong one!
Great album <SEP> This is one great album. Don't know why she got lost in my listening habits.
No interesting and boring. <SEP> First family of what? No interesting and boring.
Two Stars <SEP> very poor sound quality
"great song!!! <SEP> This song stays on repeat in my ipod!!! Can't wait for the full length album to be finished, I'm sure it will be a classic"
It's good just dial down the loud warning in beginning & end <SEP> I think this helped our driving.  I just don't like the loud announcement/warning when we are trying to sleep.
Not for me. <SEP> Had to get it for a client. Thankfully didn't have to spin it.
Another beautiful piece by David Lanz <SEP> Beautiful and haunting!
"One Star <SEP> Glitches out a goes loud and staticky at the end, useless"
Amma Whatt is Truly Amazing! <SEP> Great sound! An amazing talent! Her message of love resounds in me! Truly an underrated artist! I would recommend this to anyone!
"An oldie but goodie!! <SEP> I love the rain and because I live in the Phoenix area I see very little of it, so songs, movies, etc. with rain makes me feel so very happy!! This song was popular when I was a child, I always felt it was a haunting melody!"
"100% unique <SEP> I love this album.  Two battleships, one with a full orchestra and one with a jazz band (neither of which is shy about veering in and out of the avant garde on a moment's notice) crash at sea.  Montana Strange is the carnage."
Perfect for adventure! <SEP> So I love Olafur Arnalds and have been following him for a long time...but this track is one of my favorite! Music adds so much to everyday life experiences and perhaps my favorite time to listening to this song is on take-off on an airplane! (Shh...don't tell the FAA.) You won't be disappointed by this track.
Silly Sounds. <SEP> This is a silly sound effect. I do not know why I wasted my money on this.
"Disappointed. <SEP> I'm really disappointed. 3/4 records are fine, but of course the one I wanted the most out of the set is scratched, badly on both sides."
"bad music <SEP> purchased this recording to memorize for a wedding. the background music is loud and annoying
sounds like organ funeral music."
Five Stars <SEP> very happy
"CD #1 skips, and cannot be played. <SEP> This did not meet my expectations.  The CD #1 skips and is of no value to me.  I asked for instructions on how to get this CD replaced. and have heard nothing.  Other CD's appear all right, but I am at a loss as how these tie together.
s."
"Could Be Better <SEP> Integrity deserves props for the concept of the Worship Tools series. There are however some issues that I feel make the product less than stellar. The songs presented here have been altered from the original so they may no longer be singable depending on your voice, i.e. songs that were presented on the original recording for a male tenor lead are now altered for a Female mezzo/belter range.  The arrangements at times do not even remotely match the original recording. In integrity's defense the arrangements at times are slightly easer than what's on the recording, but I doubt that is why anyone would purchase this tool in the first place. I think that a better choice for printed song sheet materials would be the praise charts website. However, if you are looking for some visual aids in the form of DVD on how to play this type of music you might find this helpful."
"I was hoping it would of been like something I hear when I am in my home ... <SEP> I understand where Wendi is coming from, But taking Ho'oponpono apart and revising it this way that is on the CD is awlful.

I had to change this CD to a calm relaxation by Mark Bowden. Wendi Friesen was up setting to me. I was hoping it would of been

like something I hear when I am in my home land Hawaii."
"Could have been better <SEP> Music: Shantanu Moitra

Shantanu Moitra has managed to shine every once in a while, but this album is almost a complete bust for him. The only saving grace for the songs could be an apt placement in the movie, which is rare. His retro leanings in Darmiyan and Maula Tu Malik Hai are evident but they don't turn out well. Boring album.

Brownie points:

Kuch Bhi Ho Sakta Hai - The rock opening of the track is very arousing and catchy, although the songs suffers from Bollywood's interpretation of rock: Good guitars, great theme, nice beats and gritty, yet terrible vocals of Suraj Jagan. Have no  clue, when doing so many things right, Bollywood musicians end up messing such a vital component of a song. The song otherwise, is fairly interesting, although the lyrics are a bit topical to the movie.
Inkaar (Theme) - A nicer sounding theme. After Chakravyuh, this one has some character, although doesn't fulfill the expectations"
"Perfect. <SEP> Used this as the pre-show, scene change and curtain call for a play of this era. Perfect."
"Interesting soundtrack with definite Dolby signatures <SEP> This soundtrack from Gothic, 1987, a fictionalized story about Shelleys' visit with Lord Byron in Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva, and the famous challenge to write a horror story, resulting in Mary Shelley's writing Frankenstein and John Polidori's writing The Vampyre, does stand alone very well. You can definitely hear Dolby's signatures throughout the soundtrack. The two-track format is frustrating, but the sound quality is fine. If you are a Dolby fan, it has to be part of your collection. You can hear connections to works such as The Gate to the Mind's Eye, and in the last track, The Devil is an Englishman, to the track Budapest By Blimp from Aliens Ate My Buick."
"One of many..... <SEP> I have been trying to find the right music for meditation. I did listen to Joe's music on Daystar and found it very  relaxing. So I looked for it on Amazon and found it. I guess it depends on your taste,but I use this music when I read God's Word or meditate. I would encourage anyone to try it."
Great music! Well produced <SEP> Great music ! Well produced CD
"This is ""Robert Parker"" not Robert Palmer!!! <SEP> Careful - don't make the mistake that I did - this is the Robert Parker"" version, not the Robert Palmer one. I want my money back!"
"Good Tune! <SEP> Was skeptical at first, but it has definitely grown on me!  A nice, solid tune about the death of creative freedom in the popular music business.  Well done!"
"Lovely and Inspirational! <SEP> The sound and harmony in this song was pure Heavenly magic for me as I listened to it. The words are inspirational, too, talking about remembering what your dreams have always been, and ""putting your dreams in the hands of God"".  In fact, it even made me think of the things that I had always wanted to do, and simply set aside in the course of life's struggles.  This song inspired me, touched my heart, and reminded me that yes, indeed, nothing is impossible with God, and that dreams really can happen.....
The song was a blessing for me - enjoy!  :-)"
"Buoyant, uplifting, clearest diction and so appropriate for the holy days. <SEP> Great meditation for Easter!  Luke is now singing in the balconies of heaven. Gotta be ready, it's around the corner!"
He is what he sings..remarkable. <SEP> His voice and the depth of his inner spirit comes through.  It just doesn't get any better.  I've seen him in person and he is unforgettable !!
Beautiful voice <SEP> Wonderful...mellow voice. I play it a lot and the message is on target.
"Forget the words, forget the 'gun' if you can play sax like Junior you are an artist <SEP> The man plays Saxophones. like we eat ice cream...seamlessly perfect, the kind of master of an instrument that makes you want to get and dance, then, learn to play any instrument like him..."
ANOTHER WINNER. <SEP> Gavins music is all quality work. It just seems to come so natural for him !!
"I sing it so loud whenever it comes on <SEP> I came across this song with pandora, and just had to download it.  I don't want to sound cliche but I do turn this song on whenever I'm feeling out of sorts.  I love to sing along with Laura Reed.  Its a wonderful mix of soul and pop that you can definitely groove to.  I highly recommend for sad days."
"What is up with the bass? <SEP> I agree with an earlier reviewer - why is the bass cranked up so high?  When a song pops up from this album in my car mp3 mix it about blows out my speakers.  It's a shame because every song is amazing, like Horizon Rainfall (reminds me of A-ha) and Your Day's Not Over (Radiohead'ish)."
"Don't Travel by Land <SEP> I give Travel III by Future of Forestry two stars out of five.  It is a big disappointment compared to their predecessors.  It sounds a lot more like Muse and Sigur Ros, which could be a great thing for some fans, but not for me.  The vocals are lot more ethereal, which make the words hard to understand and appreciate.  Another noticeable problem I have is that the bass and kick drum are cranked up to maximum volume on almost every song.  I had to turn down the bass level in my car by 25% just to level out the rest of the sound.  Granted, I have only listened to the EP in its entirety once, so my hope is that I will come to like it some day, but I can already tell it does not hold a candle to Travel I and Travel II.  My recommendation is to travel by air and sea rather than land."
Five Stars <SEP> Okay music
it sounds like it's at a concert <SEP> to me the music does not sound the same. it sounds like it's at a concert. don't like it
"One Star <SEP> I didn't order it, and don't know who!"
"One Star <SEP> I did no like the live version, I prefer radio version"
A Love Story... <SEP> Beautifully done by The Whispers with Phyllis Hyman.
was expecting something else <SEP> did not get to a deep calm though her voice is very soothing

"Great album of violin (South Indian) and sarod (North Indian) ... <SEP> Great album of violin (South Indian) and sarod (North Indian) masters, in the jugalbandi style (""entwined twins"" model of 2 lead instruments interacting with each other).

The album begins with a North India raga (Bhopali) followed by a South India raga (Malkauns). The violin and sarod players are accompanied on both tracks by tabla and mridangam, and these drummers have their own jugalbandi section at the end of both lengthy ragas.

The album concludes with 2 short solo pieces: first by the violin, and the last track by the sarod. I think the album was recorded in 1983.

Both ragas are played exceedingly well. I have 100+ albums of music from India, and this is one of my favorites.

This LP has been re-released as a CD, with 2 short solo pieces added: track 3 is a violin solo, track 4 is a sarod solo."
"A Virtuoso Wunderkind in our time <SEP> A Virtuoso Wunderkind in our time Valentina Lisitsa
Takes my breath away, with the incredible exactitude along with pure instinct she creates moments almost unknown with her piano. She flies, leaps and crawls through a maze of picturesque beauty like no other piano Maestro alive today. She will live on long after I am gone and my children's children, she will remain as one of the greats in the century of our time. There really are no words that can display the majesty of her craft since the word craft goes right out of the window when she plays with her soul. She transports even the dourest of souls to beauty and belief that genius is alive and well."
"bad cd <SEP> Since I received my album, I can't hear the disc # 2
It isn't play in my cars or in my cd home player, I call many times to the Guillermo Maldonado's church and have not answer yet"
"Great song for a terrific singer <SEP> Did Conway ever do something bad, and this is the best version ever of a good song.  A voice silenced forever"
"Good song <SEP> enjoy bumpin this to the sound system, it hits good, and it's a good track in general. recommend if you like anything meek mill."
expensive for less than a second.. <SEP> it was expensive for a few seconds of sound..only 1 howl...
One of the best bands <SEP> Anyone who likes rock and traditional music will love this band. There are not to many bands that mix traditional and modern so well.

One Star <SEP> Its the wrong Josh Kaufman
Great songwriting <SEP> Musically Tim shares his heart on his sleeve and the result is a musical treat for the soul. The audio engineering on the songs are layered and mixed nicely.
Wonderful Flute Music <SEP> Spring In The Parmirs by Li Datong is a fantastic piece of flute music. I definitely recommend it.
"Not the best version <SEP> Only a small portion of the song was included, but the few lines sung and the music were great.  Cecil Moody"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great song, Great artist."
I hate hearing people clap and cheer over the music <SEP> It's the concert version. I hate hearing people clap and cheer over the music!
"under the impression <SEP> i was under the impression that the product i bought contained Discs 1-4, instead, i got 5-6. I really purchased this in hope that i would receive disc 1 because it had the composition which i have been searching for years. so, while the music is very good, the package left me quite disappointed"
Five Stars <SEP> Love it.
Makes me wanna dance! <SEP> I just wanna go to a club and jam all night....shut it down!! Have to move when I hear this song.
"Find another version <SEP> I just bought these two downloads yesterday,  The music pieces are good, but this sound quality is horrible.  I know it says 256kbps,  but it does not sound like it.  Honestly it sounds like someone had a cheap tape recorder,  placed that in the middle of the Orchestra, and recorded these songs,  then they took that recording, played it over the phone, and the recorded the sound on the other side of the phone, but encoded it into 256kbps.

If you like these songs,  I would suggest finding another version."
"Great song!!!! <SEP> Beautiful, just heard him sing it for the first time!!!"
One Star <SEP> GOOD QUALITY.  LOVELY CD.  THANK YOU SELLER.
"This is a great album. The music is well-crafted <SEP> This is a great album. The music is well-crafted, and it's also worth noting that this is the only version of ""Down by the Sally Gardens"" I can stand to listen-to anymore. As a Celtic music fan, I've heard so many renditions of that song that I could scream, but this one is actually pretty innocuous."
"... been looking for this album for awhile so I'm glad to have it <SEP> I've been looking for this album for awhile so I'm glad to have it,  however,  there is a lot of scratchiness on several songs which is very jarring when listening to it.  The one star rating is for the album,  not the seller,  they were great!"
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful and Spirit filled. Great for soaking in the Lord.

Wrong Classification <SEP> This is an alteration of a Romanian folk song. What a tragedy! This is the worst thing that can be done to a beautiful song. This is not art!
Love this song! <SEP> A grea short song!
"Just no. <SEP> I had to use this song for one of my APUSH music project. At one part of this song, it did not match the lyrics. I don't know if it's suppose to be like that, but it totally wasted my money when I could have just used the one that I got from a friend."
A pissed off customer <SEP> I don't like the fact that I have to buy the whole album just to get this one song: Destiny's Child - Get On The Bus
"How Beautiful!!!! <SEP> I'd almost forgotten about this LP....I had it as a teenager! It was not as popular as ""Love Won't Let Me Wait""....but I dug it and still do!!!"
Background vocals are muffled. <SEP> Waste of money.  I ordered this track with background vocals and you can barely hear them. It sounds more like a muffle. Very annoying and I had tried everything to try and bring the background vocals in louder.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
Moving song! <SEP> I heard this on the radio and it stuck with me all week so I just had to buy it!
"Excellent album, and even better in concert <SEP> Just last weekend I saw Toro Y Moi in concert (more on that later), and ahead of that I had been listening to this album, the 3rd album from Toro Y Moi (the studio one-man band from Chaz Bundick). I became a fan of him with the release of the previous album, 2011's ""Underneath the Pine"".

""Anything In Return"" (13 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with an immediately inviting pick-me-up ""Harm In Change"" and an equally charming ""Say That"", both of which signal a continuation towards the more dance-oriented songs found on ""Underneath the Pine"" and also the ""Freaking Out"" EP. But then things slow down and Bundick turns more melancholic and reflective on tracks like ""So Many Details"" and ""Cola"". In fact, the album stays mostly in that same mid-tempo groove, and somehow it works quite nicely. ""Never Matter"" towards the end of the album is one last song in which the dance-along factor is increased again. In all, I am enjoying this album quite a bit. Perfect for these summer days!

Last weekend at the FYF in Los Angeles, Toro Y Moi (live a full band, not just Bundick) put on a fantastic 50 min. set before a wildly enthusiastic (and massive) crowd. Bundick & Co. brought a great mix of old and new songs, featuring about 4 or 5 songs from this album (including ""Say That"", ""Rose Quartz"", and ""Never Matter""). I must say that live these songs sounded more massive than anything you hear on the album, and their set was one of the festival's highlights for me, without a doubt, I enjoyed it a ton! Meanwhile ""Anything In Return"" is highly recommended!"
"This is one of those... <SEP> ...""can't do without"" songs, practically an ANTHEM from the period. (I also loved that Stallone used it in ""Lock Up"", as one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dark film.)"
Beautiful <SEP> Guys- If you want to make your girl feel like she's the most important person in the world to you - play her this song.
"Beautiful and pleasing to the ears <SEP> I first heard this song on The Bachelor, I couldn't hear all the words but the music was so fantastic that I saved the program and played that section over and over til I couldn't get enough of  what I was hearing and researched the song and couldn't do without it so I purchased it, would like to hear more songs from Ben Taylor"
Five Stars <SEP> Judy greastests hits id in 8track only not on lp formont ara you selling on cd formont
"love, Love, LOVE it!!! <SEP> I liked this CD when I first heard it. But the more I listen to it the more I love it. I hear a little more, something new, something deeper every time I listen to it.  It's fabulous!"
"Everybody Knows I'm Yours <SEP> Very good album by Jim Glaser. It includes the title cut as well as The Lights of Albuquerque, arguably his best selling hit.

But here's a short story about the artist himself:

I've purchased almost all his albums from, or through, Amazon, but initially I was looking for an old obscure song of his entitled Fool Passing Through. I last heard it in 1980 and have searched for it ever since; it never was included on any album. I even wrote to the artist himself (through his website) but even he had lost the song and wasn't able to provide me with a copy. I continued searching until just recently when I managed to locate a 45 rpm single which I bought. I then contacted Jim again to tell him I'd found it.

He agreed to autograph it for me but I decided to do something different. After dubbing it to a CD, I sent him the single along with one of his albums (Man in the Mirror). I told him to keep the single (which is rightfully his after all!) and sign the LP for me. He was kind enough to do just that, and he appreciated getting one of his old singles back. Glad I could help. How often does a fan give an artist a copy of his own music?

Bottom line, Jim Glaser is a decent man, friendly to his fans, and has a great voice. For those not aware of it, he (along with Bobby Sykes) sang back up for Marty Robbins for a while. You can hear him on two of Marty's albums in particular: Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs and More Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs.

Anyway, you can't go wrong buying this or any other of his albums. If you really like Country music, you'll like Jim Glaser. That's my 2 cents!

Jim Hamilton"
Lacking Passion <SEP> Amber Bullock does not sing this song with the same energy and passion as she did as a contestant on Sunday's Best. It's very mellow and jazz like. I was dissapointed.
Five Stars <SEP> plays great.
If classical music like Mozart and waltzes is your idea of sexy then ... <SEP> If classical music like Mozart and waltzes is your idea of sexy then go for it. This is more a selection of ballroom dance songs from the 1800's than sexy music.
"Can't find it <SEP> I know the songs are great, but I can not find either song in my computer. Where did they go?"
Awesome! <SEP> Love it
"I had to purchase another one from a competitor because it would have sounded terrible at our function <SEP> This was a low quality recording.  I had to purchase another one from a competitor because it would have sounded terrible at our function. Sounded like somebody recorded it from a record or radio without being wired in.  Honestly I don't know how it was made but the sound is muffled, noisy air etc..."
Great depth and ease of listening <SEP> Essential John Barry. Great depth and ease of listening.
"Great Album! <SEP> After seeing these guys in PCB last weekend, I had to check out more of their stuff.  Great tunes!!!  Comparable to Incubus, 311......."
Sabbath fans try this. <SEP> I really liked this remake the vocals are powerful and the music awesome if you are a Dio or Black Sabbath fan you will like this.
New Deep House <SEP> Solid start for a fresh dance label out of Pittsburgh. A unique blend of house built for a dancefloor's deepest moments and created with talented DJs in mind.
Disappointing compared to previous album <SEP> I really liked the first album and was excited for the sequel but I was pretty disappointed. I've listed to it straight through several times and I still can't sing along to any of it as none of the songs have stuck in my head. Usually there's one or two songs that you just connect with but I don't fell that with Our Machine.

"Long Forgotten Wonderful Jazz Cut <SEP> My uncle was a stand up bass player and I remember listening to Charles Mingus when I spent time at his home.

As I stated in my title, although I have the Marcus Miller version of this song, I had long forgotten the original Mingus version of ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat aka Theme for Lester Young.""

Just so happened that I was watching an episode of CSI:NY entitled ""Flash Pop"" and Goodbye Pork Pie Hat was playing when the detectives showed up on a murder scene.

It is a haunting but yet beautiful song.  The story is Charlie Mingus wrote the song in tribute for Lester Young, a jazz saxophonist who passed away not too long before the recording session for the song.  Mr. Young used to wear a Pork Pie Hat hence renaming the song ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.""

R.I.P Charles Mingus and Lester Young and all of the other great Jazz musicians who have passed on."
"the item is not the right <SEP> I want obtain ""Jeep Wrangler Wind Shield Torx Screw Set of 16 Each / Fits Cj 1976-1986 /...""
and I have an audio Cd (Screw) from japanese song

I am desappointed"
God will make a way!! <SEP> Veey inspiring and encouraging.
Really!! <SEP> Never was able to play this cd 
Don't waste the money <SEP> Sounds like a sound-a-like band.  Not as good quality as the original recording.
"not the best of diorama <SEP> Honestly I'm pretty deceived by this LP. I know Diorama since 10 years now, and I don't find in this album kind of songs I use to love...

It seems anyway that the band took a more pretentious side, and wether I'm right or not I can say their beginning work is much better !  Maybe they need to review others synth pop tracks."
"Catchy Song by a relatively under-the-radar band. <SEP> This song is very good and very catchy, and it honestly makes me want to hear more from this band. It's very underrated! And if you like Passion Pit, MGMT, Empire of the Sun, etc, you should love this one!"
"New music that's a cut above what's on the charts. <SEP> Some of us do a lot of complaining that there's no good music being made anymore. Well, it's not true. If you're not happy with what you're hearing on commercial radio, or what's on the charts, you need to look a little harder elsewhere. For example, Maxi Dunn's new album ""Edmund & Leo"", her third full length album. Maxi's voice is at turns soothing, humorous, dramatic, sexy and sweet, and she does it without being overly acrobatic like so many modern singers. The songs are haunting and melodic, Peter Hackett's instrumental work is always tasteful and interesting. An artist making music for all the right reasons, I can't recommend her enough."
Five Stars <SEP> One of the best gospel songs ever.
Five Stars <SEP> So true...so real.
Five Stars <SEP> Uplifting!
Irish Fight Song <SEP> A required song for your library if you root for Notre Dame and are Irish. It sounds like you're in the stadium.
"The Power Of Joe Simon <SEP> Oh so many childhood memories are wrapped in this music. I remember growing up with my mother listening to singers like Joe Simon, Al Green, Clearance Carter. Most every song on this album, I remember hearing as a child, and though she's passed on now, I'm sure she is listening to  Joe Simon when I put his music on."
"Opus at its McCracken <SEP> McCracken achieves an aural balance in DLD which surpasses anything she's done yet. The mix of eclectic instruments, the sometimes echo on her high registers--they all blend at the exact perfect rate. Good luck classifying the album: because just when you've figured it goes into the folk category, you catch yourself humming along to lyrics with such an overtly gospel of John chapter three theme. Even DLD's cover art puts this album a notch higher than previous works.

An interesting change comes in her reallocation of background vocals. The listener must be used to previous duets from other albums, and though she entertains a few guest vocals throughout the album, she's prudently selfish enough to relegate those voices to the distant background. Applause. The overall effect is that she conveys a newfound confidence with her own voice that the listener always thought she should have anyway.

DLD marks a new milestone for McCracken: a new grade of perfection to overshadow the next dozen albums. Can't wait."
"Let's hear it for a great musician and lyricist <SEP> Gil Scott-Heron's work should be more widely known. He was the first star of what became rap music, and his political force, as well as ferocious musicality, combined to make him an important influence even today. This is his best-known song, and it's a funny/cynical introduction to his fusion of jazz, soul, and poetry."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent!
Two Stars <SEP> I was hoping the song were better
I love this album <SEP> I love this album! I heard a couple songs of theirs on Pandora and was immediately hooked on their music!
Ethereal <SEP> Love this cd.  Great to listen to any day of the week.  Beautiful lyrics with a beautiful melody.  I am a fan for life.
"mistake <SEP> Bought this by mistake while looking for anouther Scott-Heron song. I don't see his point here, even sarcastically. Dont buy"
"Song is great! But with album purchase only?? <SEP> I won't do what most people seem to do nowadays - give a low star for a great product that is packaged poorly, arrives late, or has other problems irrelevant to the actual product. The RHCP rendition of Love Rollercoaster is an awesome song! BUT, it's IMPOSSIBLE to find this version by itself. Don't know what the heck version iTunes is trying to pass off, but it ain't the original, Red Hot Chile Peppers version (original Original was the Ohio Players, of course)! Must be ubiquitous licensing rules from Hollywood that makes you have to buy the whole album for one song. What a pity ;-(. And no, I didn't buy it."
"Great example of Hartford's versatility <SEP> Great example of the easily identifiable and enjoyable Hartford ""voice"".  I like nearly everything he ever did even though he produced such a wide range of music."
Can't wait for the new Cd!!!! <SEP> I just got into this band & really love this new song. looking forward to hearing the rest of Temper Temper.
beautful music <SEP> This music is very calming and enjoyable to listen to. I'm definitely a Beecake fan for life after this album.
"Just  great! <SEP> Great groove and the layering is fantastics!  Birkii has a very warm voice but smooth in intensity.  And the remix by Equateur is just dope!
Can't wait for more."
Defective Streaming. <SEP> The live streaming stops at 30-seconds.
"Great Songs All Missing <SEP> There is a lot of great music in this series.  None of it is on this CD.  ""You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,"" not here.  ""Heathen's Kiss,"" not here.  Shazam it and buy the songs you like instead."
Five Stars <SEP> Great series reccomend it to all over 21.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent music. One of my favorite CD's ever.
"Waste of money <SEP> Do not waste your money. None of the music from the show other than the theme are on this album. In fact, the album contains music not even close to Eastern Kentucky bluegrass. I'll be using this CD to scare birds Out of my orchard"
"Rockabilly Classic <SEP> As many reviewers have noted, this album captures the best of Hank Williams, rockabilly, and country rock classics. Most importantly, after a crappy day at work, you can throw this album on the turntable, and while tapping your foot, feel, ""At least I'm not THAT screwed up!"" Wayne Hancock will open for Johnny Cash in rock and roll heaven. Play til you die."
Great Chill Jam! <SEP> Love it!
"Love this album! <SEP> Theres nothing like the blues I feel. It can pick you up when you're down, you can relax listening to it, its intense... its everything. Traffic light is a great piece, uptempo, with the rock organ doing a great job in tandem with the guitar. The vocals of course are exceptional,capturing the mood of the song with ease. Blues aint nothing has a delightfully neat bluesy rhythm that got me from the start, besides the instrument arrangement and backing vocals too. Great guitar tone on this record!"
Not Everyone is digital!!!! <SEP> It's too bad this album is not in CD form ... Not everyone is digital 
A great song from this generation <SEP> I am tired of all these songs I keep hearing on the radio with no content. This song is great! I love how Noble R tells a story about how he turns to his music through all of his troubles in life. A MUST HEAR.
Five Stars <SEP> Love the song
"becoming it!! <SEP> It is, some thing that is not just another audio album..It is a rare combination of profound, enchanting, intense and soothing sounds.one makes you more wise, other grips the very core of emotion, one makes you be in tune,  the other makes you intense and relaxed, the other is so resplendent, these are sounds that can change the very quality of a person!!!!!

The beauty of the album is that you will have a song that you are in tune with.....!!

The sounds are so fantastic....It is some thing that can only be experienced personally than just listening to what others say, as eat the sweet to know the taste, and its a very new and fantastic sweet, not of any old taste to compare with...!"
Very entrancing! <SEP> This is well thought and perfect for my extensive morning reading/meditation. I naturally wanting to join in with my own vocal harmonics too. You won't be disappointed with this soundtrack.
"Soft Japanese synth. pop <SEP> For newcomers: This is software-made music (synthetic) mostly made in Japan since 2007. Its fans normally are also fans of Japanese anime and culture. The featured singers, Megurine Luka & Kagamine Len are charactes made to personalize the music. These two are a bit popular.

This song, ""Liecia"", is soft pop style. I listen to this kind of songs while doing some activity like h.chores, driving, etc."
loud staticy noise at the end of it <SEP> Loud white noise at the end of the song. The guy at Amazon Support told me that it's the way the company downloads it and that's what you get a song with loud staticy noise at the end of it.
"There's 15 seconds of ear busting static at the end ... <SEP> There's 15 seconds of ear busting static at the end of the mp3. I checked and it's consistent across everything I can listen to this on.  What the hell, I paid money for this."
loud staticy noise at the end of it <SEP> Loud white noise at the end of the song. The guy at Amazon Support told me that it's the way the company downloads it and that's what you get a song with loud staticy noise at the end of it.
Four Stars <SEP> good music to lay back and relax with
Good stuff! <SEP> I'm always happy to get music from Drowning Pool. They just don't seem to disappoint .  Keep it up and I will keep listening.
Very Effective <SEP> I use this every night to help me relax and get to sleep and it's quite effective. Good purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for help relaxing.
"magical sounds <SEP> I got this because, they are going to make an appearance here in Little Rock this month. I had never heard them so , I was curious. Well worth the money. Calming, meditative,."
Excellent Workout!! <SEP> Excellent workout that goes by super fast.  Gregg Cook is very knowledgeable and is a talented coach and motivator.  I truly felt like I was in an actual group fitness class.  The music works well and with the ride.  I highly recommend this product.
Amazing duet <SEP> Charice's and David's rendition of this duet is just amazing!  Their amazing voices blend perfectly. AMAZINGLY AMAZING!
One Star <SEP> Received Wrong Product x 2. Purchased two but only received one credit.
:( <SEP> Was not feeling it:(
"I Love This Song! <SEP> I give this song, qerb mne five gold stars for being an excellent song!  This pop song from Egypt has a dance beat and a rock that everyone can understand.  I first heard this song circulating in a YouTube music video in 2009.  I had to buy it immediately.  Thank God that Amazon offers it for immediate download.  I would suggest this love song to anyone who has a love for popular music in any country.  I hope to hear more pop music from Egypt; they know how to rock pop ballads with seductive, entrancing soul behind the music and the lyrics-- especially to, ""Qerb Mne"".  Love this song!  <3"
"fantastic! <SEP> this is an amazing vocal work and this performance is excellent!  it's quite a bit faster than the other recording i have, but i don't know what a ""proper"" tempo would be for this piece, or if there is even a proper tempo.  my other recording clocks in at around 12:30, whereas this one is at 8:52.  quite a difference, and it makes for an interesting comparison.  anyway, this is a fantastic recording, and i highly recommend it."
Five Stars <SEP> Love Love this song!
Five Stars <SEP> Good background music for Android game.
"Awesome voice--reminds me of Michael Crawford <SEP> Beautiful voice, so serene yet masculine. Wish Marco stuck to the melody more, with less ""exploration"" with the phrasing. He has a stunning voice, just sing it as written and he would be even better."
"Five Stars <SEP> This song is so sweet! It not only teaches children, but helps adults remember the order!"
He is the worst kind of hypocrite and a terrible role model <SEP> Uriah is a racist who talks about valuing life and freedom yet wishes rape on peaceful protestors. He is the worst kind of hypocrite and a terrible role model.
"Another outstanding bite! <SEP> Two EP's in a years time and both are amazing.  If you liked the 1st, ""Angels Undercover"", then you'll like this as well.  The beauty of his music and songwriting leaves me begging for more.  I am eagerly awaiting a full CD coming out soon. If you're undecided on him, buy ""Over and Over"" and give it a listen.  It's the best song on this EP...""Razor Blades and Hand Grenades"" is 2nd."
It did not play the entire song when i bought it <SEP> i bought this song on my phone. it says its 4 minutes long but only plays about 1.25 minutes then cuts off.
Five Stars <SEP> Good song!
"Jail House Rock review <SEP> The song was of high quality, which is hard to come by from older songs, and very pleasant and upbeat"
"Finally Digital after almost 50 years! <SEP> Official notes:
Recorded at the height of the Southern California surf music craze of the early 1960's, the Surfriders' original vinyl album ""Surfbeat Volume 2,"" originally released in 1963, has become a highly prized collector's item among fans of the early surf music scene. Produced by Richard Delvy, founding member of the Challengers, one of the pioneering groups of the surf music craze, ""Surfbeat Volume 2"" actually features the original members of The Challengers masquerading as ""The Surfriders."" Finally available in the digital domain, all selections have been newly remastered.

My Notes:
This album was not part of the ""Sundazed"" set that Bob Irwin re-released in the mid 1990's of the Challengers' music. I wrote him several times to try to find out if/when this one would see the light of day. (Licensing issues with the alternate name perhaps?)  Despite the short 12 tracks, the price is a deal.  As noted, the players ARE the Challengers.  When you listen to this beside the others from the 1963-64 era, it's unmistakable. As with most all surf music you either absolutely love it or you hate it. I'm in the first camp, having grown up on this stuff.  This particular lineup (as the members changed frequently) features heavy sax work, likely Phil Pruden, and also liberal doses of that funky percussive almost japanese-sounding piano of which I'm not sure who is playing. The reverb is rich as usual, and the digital remastering is superb.  The opening track Wipe Out has an obvious swipe/dub of the original opening laugh which is the Surfari's, but the balance of the track is definitely the Challengers, likely Art Fisher on lead, Randy Nauert on Bass and of course Richard Delvy on drums.  The other covers of Memphis, Hot Pastrami, Sloop John B, Ram Bunk Shush, and Ghost Riders are all competent and pretty much surf standard. Rum Runner and Sunset Surfing are two notable and quality originals.  Go grab a cold tropical drink, pop this on shuffle/repeat, invite the gang out to the pool, and enjoy this 49-year-old gem!

P.S. My only complaint is that I wish they had made a sharper/larger cover image so when we make our hard copies for the CD Players, the artwork looks better."
wrong download <SEP> Try to download the song... gives me a different one..
"Great song! <SEP> Great song, great quality, so smooth."
Love it! <SEP> The songs are beautiful! Love the songs and download was so easy. I listen to it throughout the day along with all the other music I have downloaded.
"Even better than Marty Robbins <SEP> As a child growing up, I listened to the Marty Robbins recording of this song. Pepie does it even better."
Five Stars <SEP> Osaka Popstar's best!! Really fun and catchy tune.
Amazing <SEP> If you like the style of music that was nujabes then this album is for you. I enjoyed this album so much I listened to it at least ten times the first day I downloaded it. Aside from the music itself I think it is a wonderful peace of work and show of respect to a talented artist that like many people leave the world to early and I think that these artist show that in this with their tributes that resemble the wonderful music that is a legend of this man in my opinion.
Not what I expected <SEP> don't waste your money
Lovely! <SEP> Jan's original jazz is smooth but not too smooth to be uplifting. Her beautiful personality shines through her music too. So glad to have found this hidden gem.
"Disappointing ... <SEP> Their original version (""High & Lifted Up"" album, 1999) was a powerful, evangelistic and patriotic hymn that was an inspiration!  This rendition has been flattened out so much it has no inspiration at all except to leave you wanting and waiting for the real BTC to show up!"
One Star <SEP> It was not what I was expecting and very dissapointing
One Star <SEP> The songs are all left over scraps put into a CD. Save your money buy the 100 popular classics.
Five Stars <SEP> great cd and dvd buy it by all means
"loved... <SEP> great mini ep...  this album was so good, listening to it made my weiner so stiff that it started squirting blood"
Five Stars <SEP> Da s***
"Frustrated <SEP> This song ""frustrated"" me so much I felt compelled to negatively review it.  The preview in Amazon in no way reflects the proper nature of the majority of the song which is why it's such a dice throw to get a decent song based on such a small preview.  As the preview would have you believe, the song has a nice bluesy relaxed sound which makes nice background music but for some unknown and unimaginable reason the artist ruined the entire song by adding loud footsteps throughout the rest of the (instrumental) song.  Who the heck finds noisy hall walking relatable to slow bluesy music?  It's almost like it's a prank and justifies the name of the song completely. A fart sound would have been better because at least it might be funny but this is utterly annoying and to think I paid for it is even worse.  I'm not sure how to get a refund or if it's worth it to find out but this supports my decision to torrent music, listen to it and then buy it rather than buy it and then listen to it. Ugggh.

To the artist: Keep your weird (foot) fetishes out of the music and you might be able to relate to a wider audience or at least find extraneous sounds that are relatable to the mood of the song."
Five Stars <SEP> dope
Love this Album! <SEP> I went to a lot of the youth conferences when I was younger where these songs were played live. So I really love the memories these songs being back. Great music and great download!
"terrible quality <SEP> one of my favorite tracks of all time, was glad to see a copy on vinyl (mine has been gone for ages) It was described as new, but arrived beat up , damaged and so scratched it was unplayable.
really bummed that it was sold to me in this condition and described as ""NEW"""
"Incredible stuff <SEP> This album has been a favorite of mine for years. It's proof that Tom can handle an electric with the same intricate genius he uses on an acoustic. My wife and I walked out of our wedding ceremony to ""Emmanuel."" If you've been lucky to hear the stories behind it that Tom sometimes tells at his shows, you know how deep its roots go. Buy this record now!"
"Warning! Sound gap. <SEP> Great song but there is a sound gap at 2:11:50 to 2:11:60. Plus at this stage of the digital mp3 sales at Amazon, shouldn't all files be 320kbs CBR instead of 256kbs VBR for sound quality or even better the highest bit FLAC format, as an option.."
"A great song by Lucinda Williams <SEP> A great song by Lucinda Williams. A deep and touching story wrapped in by a strong performance. Nothing disappoints. One of the better ones, of all times."
"Bass plagiarized from a classic Coki tune <SEP> <div id=""video-block-R2AK2V5KYQ6CQV"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E1esYc7vkCS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91FF2wlGP0S.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;The bass was sampled from Coki - Red Eye (released in 2007), and the entire song even sounds similar. It's not even good as a remix, really."
Buy It! <SEP> Love Tom Rush's voice and it goes perfectly with these lyrics.  Hard to say more than that.  I love it.
"Not as quality as a good UK copy <SEP> Eeh. Not as quality as a good UK copy. Mobile Fidelity from this era is ""hit or miss"" the CBS half speed stuff is superior. TAS has it listed but I think it is borderline. I have sourced a couple copies. They all looked ""legit"" but none of them sounded as good as a ""purple label"" pressing or a good UK copy. The MFSL pressing is thin also. It is borderline Dynaflex."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesame
very nice beat. <SEP> This song sets the tone for a great lounge.  This song sets the tone for a great lounge.  This song sets the tone for a great lounge.
One Star <SEP> great
One Star <SEP> Very poor sound quality.
"My Testimony <SEP> Five is not enough love this song, this is my very own testimony. I've been through many trails and is still standing."
"NOT RECOMENDED <SEP> THIS IS A VERY BAD RECORDING FROM INTERNET,TERRIBLE SOUND AND VERY BAD PRESENTATION IS A SHAME ......NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL......DO NOT LOOSE YOUR MONEY! I DID RATE WITH ONE STAR ,BECAUSE I HAVE TOO,BUT IS ""CERO START"""
"Five Stars <SEP> da oldies, but da goodies."
Sir Charles deserves recognition! <SEP> Sir Charles has a soulful sound. Powerful vocals. His sound is similar to Johnny Taylor and Marvin Cease. A talent that has not recieved his just rewards.  I recommend this to all those who love soulful blues.
"Bad <SEP> I use a lot of soundtracks, but this one terrible, poor quality, do not buy, it is a waste of money."
"Bad <SEP> I use a lot of soundtracks but this one is terrible, hard to follow, not clear, I would not recommend"
"FAKE DO NOT BUY <SEP> This is a printable CD-R in a jewel case that is ""Manufactured by Amazon"". Don't waste your money."
"One Star <SEP> It came broken the package, is not fair."
Four Stars <SEP> Jewel case had a crack.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
Love Nicki Bluhm and the Gramblers <SEP> Writing a review for a song is beyond silly and they require you to use a certain amount of words so....NICKI ROCKS IT!
"Music for your thirsty ears. <SEP> Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers is a tall drink of water.  This band is one of the best contemporary groups out there today, and this song only reinforces that notion.  Her voice is sensational, and the Gramblers back her up perfectly. This song is powerful and hypnotic in the same vein as Fleetwood Mac.  Well worth your time!"
"Gimmicky Song - Kinsey is much more talented than this! <SEP> I've seen Kinsey Rose live in Nashville. She is extremely talented. I felt this song was too cute. Hope to hear more classic and popualr country music from her. She is a rising star, in my opinion!!"
"Fraudulent title <SEP> This album contains 13 pieces of music (actually one is just a fragment, so really twelve). Not all are concertos, but the main thing is that they say there are thirty different pieces of music because there are thirty tracks, but most pieces are multi-track works. It's blatantly fraudulent. I'm not reviewing the quality of the music or performances, and do not claim to have purchased this item."
"JAZZ <SEP> I really do love it, its smooth and cool. The music is soothing and from some great artists. Give me MORE."
Maybe 13 Mozart 'Masterpieces' <SEP> False claim that there are 40 Mozart string masterpieces here. There are 40 tracks but maybe 13 complete works of Mozart
"Favorite group <SEP> Equisitely beautiful, charming, skillful, delightfully complex.....what more can you ask of music.  They are astounding live!"
Of course this is an offensive song and should be ignored as it has been. <SEP> It takes a disgusting mind to write such a misogynistic and body shaming song.  A therapist is highly recommended for the writer of the song.
"The Song That Called Everyday Fun By. Antonio <SEP> The Song That Called Everyday Fun By . Antonio, and Mia  By.  The  Gold Power Ranger  and  Pink Power Ranger"
"Not enough tracks <SEP> Firstly, I should say that I don't possess this particular album.  I do, however, possess all the track in another manifestation: namely, Ricardo's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toques-Flamencos-de-Guitarra/dp/B00A2TIME0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toques Flamencos de Guitarra</a>, which contains 13 tracks, including the 11 featured here.

And that is also available on Amazon, for (as I write) a dollar more than this album.

You pays your money and takes your choice.

Nio Ricardo (1904-72) was one of the two most influential and in-demand flamenco guitarists of his generation, the other being Sabicas (1912-90); both were seminal in the musical formation of the young Paco de Luca.

In contrast to Sabicas, Ricardo recorded relatively little solo material; but what he did produce is essential listening (despite Ricardo's alarming habit of humming &mdash; or rather, groaning &mdash; along with the guitar).

The photo on the cover is printed in reverse: Ricardo didn't play left-handed."
"Touching But Not Sappy <SEP> I thoroughly enjoy this album.  It brings my heart to fond memories of the joys, sadness, and ""opportunities for growth"" that relationships and life have given me.  Every time I treat myself to Mira's songs, I feel happier."
thank you for nothing <SEP> Bought in because the guy from LOST was in it. Horrible tone though. Awful message. Do not buy this ever!
Love it <SEP> Love it
Greatest Comedy Album I have heard in a long time <SEP> I am a huge fan of this album. I have already listened to it 3 times through completely. The more you listen to the songs the funnier they get. Generic Pop Song is the perfect Parody of all popular pop songs. Denim Shorts is hilarious and inspires me to wear some denim shorts out in public again. Girl #5 is an excellent song and has a great guitar solo in there. Just all around this album is excellent I recommend everyone to purchase this album. It could be the next big hit.
... will make your hear melt one of my favorites love the video it explains the <SEP> this song will make your hear melt one of my favorites love the video it explains the song
"Too rocked out and pop <SEP> I only like a couple of the tracks on this CD.  If I had previewed it I would have bought a different CD from this duo. In this CD they try to push the envelope and play other genres with stars of those genres.  I just wanted to hear beautiful, relaxing music - this wasn't it!"
"Not The One <SEP> This was not the musical version I was seeking, but it provided the basics. We finally had a musician record a version we could use."
"Sulic and Hauser <SEP> It's so great to find artists who are treating music with some respect and dignity.  I have yet to find a piece by these masterminds that I don't like.  I might be extremely biased, since the cello is probably my favorite instrument, but I promise no matter the piece - you'll love it!  While a lot of their current pieces are a sort of ""cover"" of another song, I can't wait for the album they construct that is of purely their own creation!"
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful
Five Stars <SEP> Just love these two.
not happy <SEP> 1 song on a cd. I expected several for $9 price. Not worth it. Should explain that you only get 1.
"Not the original singer <SEP> I was disappointed since I wanted a Clean version for my daughter to listen to.  This ""mix"" is not the original song.  I did not know that.  The singers aren't anywhere close to the original.

Meh!"
not as good as I thought <SEP> Its similar but not nearly as good as the original. I would rather have the offensive words bleeped out and keep the feel the same.
"Better than Bieber!! <SEP> This has become a household favorite!! My son loves this song, & his British accent is getting much better!! Absolutely great song & WAY better than the original!! We love The Brett Domino Trio!!! :) Keep 'em coming!! :)"
One Star <SEP> Thought this was the original - it was a cover. That fact was NOT clearly stated.
feel cheated <SEP> I mistakenly bought this thinking it was clean radio version of Thrift Shop by Macklemore.  Be warned!  It is not!  It is by some other group.  Waste of my money.
"awful!! <SEP> Awful sound quality, hate i wasted my money!
My son really likes the song and i was looking fora radio version, instead i got second hand kids bop version."
"Not What I expected <SEP> this is weak cover version, not a radio mix of original song. Vocals here are poor, everything a little off. Deleted after one listen."
"Unexpected version <SEP> The reason I am giving this two stars is because when I purchased the ""clean version"", I thought it would be song by the original singer but it is not nor does it sound like the original singer. I love the clean version for my kids but if it were a ""kid's bop"" version or the original singer then it would have got five stars."
Five Stars <SEP> Used for a slide show.
"Not for massage therapy <SEP> This is not at all appropriate for doing massage. It is nice perhaps for background music as you are doing chores around the house, but apparently no one told Clookai that massage music has to be 60 beats per minute or slower in order to slow the client's heart rate. Every track is set up the same way: Clookai plays nice, slow, soothing flute music but someone in the background is playing fast, sometimes staccato music on one or more instruments, ruining the effect for massage. If the album were only the flute portion, and slowed way down, it would be great for massage therapy."
"Tears <SEP> Literally,I cried when I heard this. Why would someone ruin beautiful Beethoven? Why? I cried and felt sick, just by listening to a sample. Beethoven is rolling over in his grave, as is every musician. This is blasphemy."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this CD!!
Horrible track! <SEP> It sounds like karaoke and can't be used on a gig even for demonstration purposes. Sondheim accompaniment tracks should be recorded with much more taste and style. With live musicians!!
Five Stars <SEP> Soothing and calming.
Sound quality is absolutely terrible. This song can never be found at CD ... <SEP> Sound quality is absolutely terrible.  This song can never be found at CD quality of 320 kbps.  Guess they don't want to release it that way.  This Luther Jackson is full of himself.
"Keep up the good work... <SEP> This is a great song and performance. The melody is strong and tuneful. The singer has an attractive vocal tone, and puts real feeling into the lyrics.
The performance quality is high throughout, both vocally and instrumentally. Overall, the song is distinctive and original, and I think it has strong commercial potential."
Awesome! <SEP> Heard it on the ad for the PGA and was immediately taken that I had to find it....I searched and searched and found it on Amazon. It's an awesome tune!
"Love this song! <SEP> Not going to lie, the PGA golf commercial brought me here. Great song all around though, although it would be nice if it was a little longer."
One is all you need! <SEP> one of my favorites
This song is on a public domain website <SEP> This song is on a public domain website called freepd.com. You can download it for free according to their site. The song on that site is called Pickitah Motion j By Frank Nora. I don't get it why is this company selling it on amazon if it is a public domain song.
"a woman sings it <SEP> Cheap remake, I deleted it. Wasn't what I wanted."
Five Stars <SEP> love this
"At it's best, a cheap imitation of Devo <SEP> At it's best, a cheap imitation of Devo, at its worst David Byrne doing a cheap imitation of Devo"
"This MP3 download is TERRIBLE! the VERY beginning <SEP> This MP3 download is TERRIBLE!  the VERY beginning, sounds like it's a scratched CD, and plays 90 miles per hour, then SUDDENLY slows down in the second line of lyrics!"
Very cool! <SEP> Very cool song. Great tune and chilling lyrics. Former Yes guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Billy Sherwood sang amazing lead and backing vocals on this song.
"I love this song it's very peaceful listening to it. <SEP> Open Season is an awesome song, I'm glad I found it and got it..........you will also like it too! :-o)"
"Amazing new music <SEP> I'm so happy to hear a fresh new sound.  This music on one level is very complex, but at a
visceral level it manages to please as well.  I hear lots of prog rock influences as well as some
cutting edge 'jazz.'  I strongly recommend this album for anyone looking for some new sounds that
will satisfy."
"Terrible...don't waste your money! <SEP> It was a terrible version of the song, with only some of the lyrics.  Very dissatisfied with this purchase!"
Not Paul Anka or anyo e similar <SEP> this is not Paul Anka... totall mistake on my part
Five Stars <SEP> Good sound.
"Alex Matos <SEP> Excellent salsa dancing music. I didn't buy the album but I got the best of it. About 5 tracks of the best salsa I've heard in a long time. Check this guy out, he really got it going on."
gonna be a hit <SEP> the band intrigues me great song good storyhope to catch them live if they're ever in the areain the near future
"Awesome! <SEP> I heard this song on YouTube first, and simply fell in love. You can definitely search it up and listen to the whole song on YouTube before you decide to buy it, though."
"Words can not describe... <SEP> Such a calming and peaceful voice, I'm feel so happy and enlightened listening to Arden sing. Recommend to anyone and everyone, no matter your musical preference, you need to experience this."
"Beautiful music, melodies <SEP> Beautiful music, melodies, and vocals - mostly.  About 4 of the tracks appear to be the group just messing around and shouldn't have been included on the album.  Also, production quality on some tracks is appalling.  ""Flowers Bloom"" sounds like it was recorded on a hand held cassette recorder.  Maybe not all of the produced CDs are that way but I know it wasn't just the one I bought.  5 stars for most of the tracks. Zero stars for others."
One Star <SEP> I actually ordered the wrong cd. But I didn't care much for this one.
GREAT DUO! A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN! <SEP> THESE 2 MUSICIANS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER SO WELL. ADD TO THAT THEIR VERY UNIQUE STYLING & INTERPRETATION OF SOME GREAT STANDARD TUNES!
"Loved it, so I checked out Amazon and found ... <SEP> I happened to be thumbing through my TV channels and caught this guy singing this song.  Loved it, so I checked out Amazon and found it and bought it.  Great song and he does a great job on it."
Two Stars <SEP> None stop music.
NEW GODS OF MUSIC <SEP> THE SOUND IS FANTASTIC!  THE IMAGE IS HAUNTING!  I did not expect to hear what came out of my speakers when I first heard these beings of dark and mysticism
Five Stars <SEP> quick shipping great product as stated
"Offensive & Rude- Don't Buy! <SEP> Our church's kids choir recently put on this show and it was incredibly offensive.  The spiritual message was great, but Kathie Hill's version of ""humor,"" was to have children imitating minorities who did not speak English as a first language.  There were characters dressed up as stereotypes using fake Japanese, Indian & Russian accents, and scenes where the joke was that the choir could not understand their accents. (The instructions for the stereotypes and accents are right in the book-- the author instructs the Choir director to put the show on this way).  It was just plain rude, and the horrible thing was that there were people in the audience who were from the background being stereotyped on stage.

For a church trying to reach out to their community this is an absolutely terrible choice.  I don't believe that the author intended to be racist, but that is exactly what came across.  We are trying to teach our kids to be missionaries to the world, so I don't see how making fun of minorities achieves that aim."
Healing Song <SEP> I bought this song based on Joe's Book. So sorry but I wasn't impressed. Though it did give me a chuckle. It's cute.
Sucks! <SEP> La vida Lica?
Wonderful arrangements <SEP> The selection of songs and the arrangement of each one is both striking and refreshing. Dolce has clearly chosen this ensemble of work for a reason. We love it! What a beautiful voice!
"Best new artist with timeless sound <SEP> Larissa is an up and coming new break-out artist with a soft and sexy voice.  Her unique sultry sound and delivery is unlike anyone else out here today. ""Suddenly"" is a beautiful duet with Marshall Thompson of the world renowned Chi-lites adding a silky and soulful touch that only he could have given.  Both voices blend and balance in a rhythmic dance that gives this track a wonderfully romantic and mellow vibe.  Uncannily, while this song is full of soul, it effortlessly crosses over into many genres.  Upon the first few lines, you are immediately captured and hooked on this enchanting song.  Larissa's remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suddenly/dp/B00B0JF6Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suddenly</a>&nbsp;is a hit and a ""must-buy."" You will want to activate your ""repeat "" button and listen to it over and over.  I look forward to her next release."
A good CD <SEP> First CD I have bought from this group and I like it.  A good mixture of surprisingly relaxing progressive strong bet music
Five Stars <SEP> love miss Jody
Five Stars <SEP> Outstanding!
Unknown Hit <SEP> This is a really great alternative song and an underrated hit. Check it out!
"Not the version I was looking for. There was ... <SEP> Not the version I was looking for. There was a completely different rendition in the 70s. Sounded more ""folksy"" .... Sure wish I could find that one."
Very Encouraging <SEP> I have listened to this message over and over again and each time it's been enlightening and my faith is strengthened.
"The RajMan Review <SEP> Although Isadar's latest solo piano album was timed to release around Valentine's Day because of its love-inspired themes, the music is wide-ranging and versatile enough to be enjoyed all year long.

The real love that comes through on the CD is that which Isadar clearly has for music and the piano, as evidenced by his brilliant and quirky songwriting and passionate performances. Some of the tunes are subtle and intimate, and others are grand and sweeping, but they are all clever and original thanks to Isadar's convention-defying compositions. Sometimes you think you know where the music's leading you, and then all of a sudden it comes at you out of left field, making it lively and engaging.

This writing style keeps Isadar's fingers on their toes, so to speak. Isadar's mastery of his craft is apparent in the seemingly effortless ease with which he can go from light to dark and from understated to emphatic. His phrasing and chord progressions are also smart and snappy.

This is a rewarding experience for those who are willing to accompany Isadar on his musical journey of love."
"Such a cool song <SEP> It's one of those songs that just give you the feeling to smash anything in sight, I love it so much."
Tired <SEP> As a huge Giants fan this was very disappointing. The Two Linnell songs are weak but Black Ops really is awful. Let's hope the album's better. Avoid the EP.
Solid jazz. <SEP> Wonderful jazz playing by this talented ensemble.
It's Not Goodbye But See You Later <SEP> When I listen to the lyrics of this song I thought about all of the love ones who have gone go to Glory.  It spoke to me as conformation that we will see each other again.  Plus I enjoy the ministry of Mrs. Dottie Peoples
Does not download <SEP> Waste of money. Does not download onto computer. This review requires me to write 12 more words. Don't buy from Amazon and download. It does not work.
"Hey, listen! <SEP> This is a fairly lackluster and ill-produced set of covers for what should be an amazing set of songs.  Someone clearly took the score from Zelda, pasted it into a synthesizer program, and output this album.  Looping tracks (for example, overworld themes) are repeated with no variation and have abrupt endings.  There is no dead space at the end of any track, so if you play these songs back-to-back the last note of a song will play directly into the first note of the next song.  Worst of all, the synthesizer used to produce this works OK (at best) for the older tracks that were chiptune to begin with, but for the more modern songs, such as the Windwaker theme, all panache and soul has been removed.

The only thing I accomplished by listening to this album is that, a) I wish I hadn't wasted the money, and b) I wish I had the original soundtracks to listen to."
Two Stars <SEP> Came warped
"Not that good. <SEP> I'm an XTC & Andy Partridge  fan. This album has a few moments, but I found it to be a bore. It seemed like Keneally was trying too hard to say, "" look at all the stuff I can do with my machines!"" It seemed like a complicated mess. I wanted to like it, but after each listen , I decided that I can't make myself like something. I last tried that with Nirvana's Nevermind album, which left me cold and depressed.  I respect Mike Keneally's talents as a guitarist and vocalist, but a great  tune smith he is not. I don't know how much Partridge contributed, but it wasn't enough. Andy please put out what you do best. Great songs!"
One Star <SEP> Not happy with this song ;(
Two Stars <SEP> thought it was the band too.
OUTSIDE INTRUDER <SEP> THIS  VERSION  OF  STEVIE  WONDER  SUPERSTITION  IS  REALLY  NICE  I  BEGIN  LOVING  THIS  VERSION  RIGHT  AWAY  I'M  NOT  FAMILIAR  WITH  CHRIS  (  BIG  DOG  &  RHON LAWRENCE  )  BUT  COMING  ACROSS  THIS  VERSION  MADE  ME  BECOME  CURIOUS  AS  TO  HOW  MUCH  MORE  THESE  ARTIST  HAVE  DONE  SO  MY  GOAL  IS  TO  LOCATE  AS  MANY  SONGS  THESE  ARTIST  HAVE  DONE  AND  SO  I WOULD  ADVISE  ANYONE  LOOING  FOR  OTHER  VERSIONS  OF  STEVIE  WONDER  SONGS  TO  CHECK  OUT  THIS  VERSION  OF  SUPERSTITION  THEY  WILL  NOT  BE  DISAPPOINTED  THIS VERSION  IS  SERIOUSLY  NICE .
Four Stars <SEP> Love it!
Home To Me Rating <SEP> I just bought the MP3 version of this song through Amazon and I love the song. I couldn't find the entire album though.
Awesome <SEP> Sarah Darling has such a sweet voice. She is very talented and I look forward to hearing more from her.
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
One Star <SEP> I never bought this so idk why I can review it
faker bands <SEP> this sounds just like country the s***ty song sounds somebody dirving its pissing me off and also i hate the picture it looks FAKE
Good <SEP> Good music- should have done it sooner. it gives you a little bit of everything.. I have to buy my sister one so that she will leave mines alone...Loving it!!!!
"Tracks are few decibels quieter than my other songs <SEP> All of the tracks are very quiet, almost like someone turned down the volume when transferring these to tracks,  they're a few decibels quieter than all the other songs I have on my ipod.  I had to take them off because it was annoying me so bad.

But alas, If you put all 99 on at a party and turn it up it would be a great relaxing mix for any classy social gathering"
I loved the song <SEP> I was able to download my song on my ipod and play it over and over again! It was my first time to download but it was very simple to use!
Heartwarming <SEP> I have recommended this CD to all my family and friends...It will lift you up knowing that the children are helping heal their town.  It download quickly to my kindle from cloud...enjoy..do not delay...support the families of Newtown.
"How could you not ... <SEP> ... love this song?  The Children of Newtown, CT featuring Ingrid Michaelson got together to make a record of this song to benefit those touched by the senseless killings of many children and teachers in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on December 14, 2012. Not only is this a beautiful song, but when sung by children it brings a tear to one's eye when one realizes how this community has truly come together."
"A ""Must Purchase"" for Any Fan of Modern Swing <SEP> I'd been waiting for a few years to get a copy of the Nikki Yanofsky/Will Iam/Herbie Hancock version of ""Savoy"".  (It was only available with purchase of the entire e-book before.)  Then last week I found out about the release of this soundtrack album on the Hey Mister Jesse podcast (a monthly show with news, information, and reviews of music of interest to Lindy Hoppers and swing DJs).

Not only did I get the track I was waiting for ... but many other great big band, swing-hop, and blues tracks as well.

If you only buy one swing-jazz album this year - this should be it!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great addition to a memorial.
"Downloaded Incorrectly <SEP> This music is not Chuck Leob. This is not what I heard on the radio the other day. I searched it and the music comes from a different artist. Don't no how to get my money back, but I will not buy that way again."
"yuck <SEP> this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks."
"say no <SEP> slow.  synthesizer/piano. incomprehensible lyrics
""Dont you ever feel it's too much.
Crashing waves pinning us to the wall.
All the things that super suck
I think I hear your mama call."""
"hated it <SEP> this just goes to show that you don't need talent to get your crappy music published. i don't care if the song was free, i would honestly pay to NEVER hear it again."
"A very tight Kim Fowley produced Runaways like Album. {But only the voice and rhythm guitar actually played by a teenaged girl. <SEP> This album has been on my playlist since it was new. Released in UK 1978, and bought in 1978.
When I'm in the mood for Elvis Costello's Mystery Dance played by the Runaways. or the Elvis / Jerry Reed Baby What you want me to do? out this album comes. Her self penned numbers [the rest] aren't dwarfed by these numbers. Glad I bought it. Cherry Red; go on press a CD of this, you know you want to!"
"Great music! Talented musician! <SEP> I was very impressed with the instrumentals, lyrics and vocals on Pushkin Street. I listen to all types of music and I appreciate what Raffi Joe has produced with his latest album. The music is soulful and I especially loved the flamenco guitar featured on this album. Looking forward to Raffi Joe's next album!"
"Great debut album <SEP> Raffi is a friend of mine from high school, and I made sure to buy this album on the very first day.  It's definitely unique, which I'm not normally into, but I love this album.  If you look him up on youtube, be aware that the polished studio tracks sound much better than the amateur-recorded concerts that you'll find there.

I listened to this album three times on the day I bought it, and I can't wait for a follow up.  If I had to pick a weak point, I'd say that the lyrics in ""Crowds in the Streets"" are a little cliche.  But it's still a catchy tune!"
classic <SEP> it's a classic. and it's done really well.
"Incomplete album (as of 12/18/16) <SEP> Buyer beware: Before you download, make sure that there are 11 tracks in this album, not 9. When I purchased it, I never received ""The Lads in Their Hundreds"" (No. 5 from A Shropshire Lad) and ""O Fair Enough Are Sky and Plain"" (No. 2 from Bredon Hill and Other Songs). I have notified Amazon and hopefully they will correct the problem soon.

The complete recording of the Cameron/Moore Butterworth cycles (the same performances) can be purchased elsewhere on Amazon as part of a digital album entitled English Song Album (Historic Reissue). A much better deal too!"
"It's Fresh <SEP> Love the new Freestyle lsounds. A CD worth to be added to any one's collection. FYI, Freestyle like this can still be heard at www(dot)freestyle4ever(dot)com"
Finally found it <SEP> This song was so hard to find. Then I noticed that Amazon had it and I was too excited.  Keep more gospel coming:)
This is not the group New Order <SEP> I don't know how this gospel group gets away with squatting on the name New Order when there has been an established international group by that name since 1980.  It's confusing to consumers and they should change their name to something else.
"Flux Pavilion introduced me to Dubstep <SEP> Flux Pavilion introduced me to Dubstep, like I'm sure he did many others with ""I Can't Stop"". Well I can't believe it took me so long to purchase this album. Flux continues to press the movement with a bit of a genre bender. One Two Three is an excellent song with some trap elements that make it a true banger. In a different vein ""Blow the Roof"" is the same in that it combines house elements with drops that make me wish I was at a festival. Well done Flux Pavilion."
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
"Trust, these ones are up and commers!! <SEP> Don't wait until you hear this band playing on the radio to get to love them! They will be there soon enough, but wouldn't it be great to be the one who could sing along during the worldwide radio premier?! :)"
love it <SEP> I really love this song although it could of had some more lyrics to the song besides (i feel it)
"Surprised! <SEP> What a great surprise this was!  Enjoy the Silence (Live) is very well done by Kim and I can't stop listening to it, the guitar work is awesome and her voice is enchanting on the track.  The remix of Baby Obey Me with Il Inspecta really turned out well and made me a huge fan of the song, before the remix I thought the song was just ok for background music but the remix opened my ears and I love it.

Kids In America (Live) no matter what this song always makes me reflect and smile, she could never do this song wrong and always puts a new interesting spin on it.

Anyone who is hesitant in buying this single, it is worth the risk!"
"There is 'No' False Satisfaction to This CD <SEP> I have Burnstitch's previously released music & really enjoy it.  I like it because they have a heavier sound!  This album just improves upon the music they have put out so far!!  If you are a fan of harder core music, you will enjoy this album!  Look for all the tracks to be great, including 'Unresolved,' 'As I Return,' & 'Blink of an Eye.'"
"Every track is a winner <SEP> Love this entire CD!  It is sweet and sassy and fun and sad....
I highly recommend this to anyone who remotely likes bluegrass/country/bluesy sweetness.
Doesn't hurt that the main fiddle player is my very talented niece Kyra Key.  :)"
Five Stars <SEP> Inspiring song
Great music to start my day <SEP> Was looking for some uplifting music with some rock tones.
"Horrible cover, get the original (Daniel & John Licht) <SEP> This cover version is simply horrible.
Get the original by Daniel Licht (and Jon Licht)"
"Save your money.... get the real version. You'll be glad you did. <SEP> I so love the original, and this cover is a waste of money, even if it is less than one dollar. The female vocalist strains her limited range, and she whines and wrings the lyrics quite unnecessarily."
A Disappointment <SEP> I bought it based on a review that I read and it to me is not romantic. I am quite disappointed and stopped it after listening to half of it.
"Question <SEP> Looking at the track list and listening to the samples - and being a giant Vinx fan - I already own over half these songs from other albums.  Can someone tell me if there's any reason to repurchase?

Five star review though, because the songs are fantastic and Vinx is a unique and wonderful artist."
Five Stars <SEP> I love this music. I'm 24 and I still bump this
"A fantastic musical experience. <SEP> This album will always be a keeper in my library. I bought this CD when it was released and have been listening to it at least once a month. Doane Perry, Of Jethro Tull, is amazing. He shows that drummers can write music also.

Get this cd. You won't be disappointed."
Who? <SEP> Brenda Lee? Really? Try again.
Mom's funeral music <SEP> Just what my mother wanted to be played at her funeral and I was able to give that to her at her funeral on 10/16/2014.
"A Gem! <SEP> 5 Stars! Not only does Armin outdo himself again, Fioras vocals will leave you with chills wanting more! I highly recommend the extended mix!"
Armin is a boss <SEP> This song was really amazing as all of armin van buuren songs are flora has a spectacular voice that was great for this song who ever buys this will not regret it.
Christina Adkins <SEP> This band is awesome.....and even better in person.  I got the chance to see them perform and they sound just like what is recorded on their cd.  I have to say not all bands do but this band does.  Excellent job can't wait to see them again.....If you get a chance to see them do it  !!!!!  You will have a great time.
"The ""Queen"" has arrived... <SEP> ""Queen of Hell"" - regard it as a preview of ""Time's Arrow"" (ASoT's forthcoming full length album) if you like (since it was recorded at the same time). I'm not going to mince my words; Queen of Hell is one massive slice of metal. This release doesn't rely on hooks, it assaults you with bloody great big enormous anchors, anchors that drag you down into another sonic world that ASoT seem capable of doing so very easily. No bubble gum, throwaway material here; ASoT have a knack of writing songs that get inside your skull and embed themselves and won't go away. Since receiving the review copy of the EP I must have played it on constant repeat at least 10+ times - it's still growing on me and it is showing no signs of slacking off.

Opening with the title track, ""Queen of Hell"", an atmospheric keyboard intro surrenders to a massed vocal chant, ""Hail! Queen of Hell! Hail! Queen of Hell!"" which itself merges into a killer buzzsaw guitar riff and massive double kick-drum pounding. Nina Osegueda then completely slices off the top of your skull with a scream that truly could have come from the depths of Hell itself! Mission accomplished and we're only 53 seconds into the track. This song is already firmly established as a live favorite and the recorded version takes this several steps beyond. Production is again handled by Kevin Gutierrez (Shinedown, While Heaven Wept, Raven) from Assembly Line Studios in Vienna (VA, USA) and what an exceptional job he has done yet again (having previously been the man behind the desk for the previous release, OotD). Consistency is a great thing when something is working this well.

For those familiar with Out of the Darkness, it will come as no surprise that ASoT have yet again found a tale to tell very much in the mould of Alice Cooper meets Lizzy Borden, in the shape of the second track on the EP, ""Hello Nurse"". Where ""Kill That Bitch"" (from OotD) took us on a rather murderously wild ride, ""Hello Nurse"" puts us inside the romantically obsessed mind of a rather unconventional nurse who seems to want to do rather more than simply assist the doctor. With lines line ""Oh, nurse, could you pass me my tool(s)"" and  ""Doctor do you see me here, I'm severing his leg"", with the sound a chainsaw in the background you'll get the idea. Throw in a bluesy piano solo that culminates in a play-off between the piano and Josh Schwartz on guitar and you have a slightly unusual combination of a `fun' metal track. Given this is an EP, it is the perfect venue for the band to have a little fun.

If the previous track wasn't adventurous enough, how about a Black Sabbath cover? ""What?"" I hear you exclaim... ASoT make no attempt to hide their classic metal roots with bits of Sabbath, Priest, Dio and Iron Maiden sneaking out every now and then, and trust me I thoroughly applaud and support this - we need more bands who are not afraid to draw on the foundations of this music genre. But here we go one giant step, and a step that ASoT themselves generally steer clear of, and have included a cover of the slightly obscure Sabbath tune, ""Trashed"" from the ""Born Again"" album (the one and only Sabbath album to feature Ian Gillan). After playing the original and the ASoT version back to back, I am prepared to state that the ASoT version just about `trashes' the Sabbath version... wow, am I allowed to write that? Is that metal sacrilege? Normally I am not a fan of cover songs, but a few folks recently have pulled it off  - Stryper with The Covering and Testament with the bonus tracks on Dark Roots Of Earth spring to mind - and now we can add ASoT to the list. Excellent stuff.

The EP finishes up with a second version of Queen of Hell featuring Veronica Freeman from Benedictum as a duet with Nina. This is another power trip and really shows how good the song writing underlying the track really is. It's hard to pick which version I prefer but the pure ASoT opener gets the win by a whisker.

What can I say, this is an exceptionally good release all round - if there is a complaint it would be ""I want more!"". So, I'll have to wait for ""Time's Arrow"" to solve that. So what to score this? This is an easy 5 stars."
"Something Missing <SEP> If you were looking for that great version you heard on You Tube, This isn't it!
For some reason ""The Gael"" isn't among the tracks featured here.
Do the producers of ""The Best of Celtic Music"" want us to buy the whole CD?
Is it even on the CD?"
Great song. Bad rip <SEP> Great song. Bad rip. There are several skips in this track. It's like I am listening on a bad discman.
Five Stars <SEP> One of Armin's best in recent years. Can't stop listening!
love it <SEP> its great to hear one of those songs you never tire of hearing and it helps me get through the day with a swell beat
"Did not like! <SEP> Ordered by mistake i deleted after i heard it. Did not like the lyrics after listening to them, yes I am one of those people, the words are what gives meaning to the music not the beat."
"Poorly mixed, harmonies are off, over sampled <SEP> Wow, all I can say is this is the only purchase that I have made that I wish I could get a refund.  Deletion is just too good for it."
One Star <SEP> Not for me
Five Stars <SEP> sweet song!
"Try this out. <SEP> A real suprise. I bought this only because it was a ""cover"" of a Pat Metheny tune, however I really like it. I think I will explore this artist more. Subtle and beautiful."
cool <SEP> Great song. Love the Amazon mobile app for my phone. Google play has never found all the songs on my device. Amazon's app works.
"AWESOME! <SEP> God is using Tasha to show the world how Praise and Workship should be. She is so free in her workship, there's no question that she has been in God's presence!"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great product, great service, would highly recommend."
Best song ever! <SEP> This song is Amazing! But for your Grace!
"vikings in the gym <SEP> this song is great for working out to. I love the music and the mix of metal and classical. Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"" mixed with the heavy metal music seems a natural combonation."
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
"Five Stars <SEP> This whole album is amazing, it's worth every penny!!"
Mistake order - never would buy <SEP> Crappy song.  I thought it was 'when the bodies hit the floor' from Drowning Pool.  This song is terrible and would lov my money back
Edification of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ <SEP> Excellent song.
"devotional songs <SEP> I have been trying to find another album like this without any success. Lyrics are in english and the whole album is masterfully done, vocals and keyboards."
cute and groovey <SEP> i love this song its so cute and it has a meaning behind it and so does the movie i recomend it its so great
Music <SEP> Thank you for the song that I was trying to find. I would purchase again if I need to again.
Five Stars <SEP> Fantastic !!!
"It doesn't tell much of the story of John the ... <SEP> It doesn't tell much of the story of John the Baptist, more of a general description.  The last minute is a catchy modern song about there being no other name under heaven by which we can be saved - yes it was the message of John, the Baptist but still not really about the man."
"A great tributo to Bo <SEP> Bo has always been one of Eric's idols and in the past he and The Animals paid tribute to Diddley more than once as they wrote a couple of songs with Bo as the main topic. Bo Diddley put the rock in rock and roll, but Eric puts the soul and feeling into this tribute to the legendary Bo, and he does it to perfection. I recently added this song to my live set and the people love it. This is a true masterpiece when you're ridin' on the Bo Diddley Special."
Good and Funny <SEP> He is very funny and I looking for a Cd or record.
Buy this! <SEP> Mustand Sally and Tobi Lee ROCK!  This is better than a lot of what you'll hear on Country Radio today.  Can't wait for the entire album!
Love Mustang Sally <SEP> My favorite girl band! I go to see Mustang Sally every time they play near by. Tobi Lee is so much fun. I can't wait for an entire album!
Four Stars <SEP> very good
Five Stars <SEP> very good
Doors Classic Has the Right Beat! <SEP> This classic Doors tune has the perfect rhythm for a run. The drive of bass line in the organ combined with Jim Morrison's powerful vocals makes the road seem to glide away behind me!
"Poor production values <SEP> These are really cheesy covers for the most part. Poor production values, just kind of lame. I was looking for a low cost way to refresh my running mix and this was pretty much a letdown."
"Awful <SEP> I sampled it, and I must say it has cheapened any music experience i could hope for- creativity, genuinity, and sincerity: it lacks all of these qualities. I don't even think it's suitable for the genre/ category it belongs. It's truelly disturbing and the appeal? Beyond self inflicting. Even as a spoof of music, and expression, the demeanor is hateful... even predatorial, on all accounts. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who seeks the most tasteless music. I don't recommend it at all."
This is NOT the Pit Bull and Sensato Song <SEP> This is not the Pit Bull and Sensato song that you have heard on the radio... Buyer beware. I just wasted my money...
KW's Best of REMIXES part 1 <SEP> Kristine W -- AMAZING dance artist. SO many number 1 billboard dance hits and now she is giving her fans what they want - new and rare best of REMIXES --- can't wait for parts 2-10
Not my cup of tea <SEP> Disgustingly racist disguised as Pro Black.
"White Boy Funk <SEP> This album is OK at best. It by no means offers anything new to the musical world and as far as the funk goes it's pretty standard and by no means enters into the world of madness. They have all the elements of funk present, but lack the thing that takes it to the next level. I can't tell you what that missing thing is (soul, natural rhythm etc...) but it's not there. I was looking forward to getting it but was disapointed. You can do without this one."
One Star <SEP> Sucks!!
"Not full version <SEP> I was disappointed after I heard the version I bought---it was only a minute long, while the original version I've heard was 2:12."
"Great! <SEP> The ep is full of emotion and strong lyrics backed by music with just as much feeling.

I thoroughly enjoy this album.

Well worth the wait."
This song makes me dance! <SEP> I love all of the music on this CD but especially this one. The story and the musical in this song takes me right to the dance floor:)
"I am unable to listen to this garbage <SEP> Terrible!  I am unable to listen to this garbage, and as soon as it's attrocity afronts my ears I turn it off."
"ughh <SEP> this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks."
"He does it again... <SEP> This is a great follow up to Russell's ""Season of change"" CD.  A great band, with Russell and Brice Winston, Dwight Kilian, Eric Rasmussen, and Rob Moore.  Inventively wonderful free jazz, and Anachromysticism a blast!"
"There are several seemingly random and unnecessary fade ins and fade outs during the performance <SEP> There are several seemingly random and unnecessary fade ins and fade outs on the cd during the performance, sometimes during climaxes.  For example, there's a fade in at the beginning of the big entrance to the finale.  In addition, you can hear someone turning the volume up and down during the performance.

If you like your listening interfered with and frustrating, then this is for you."
"Incomplete file <SEP> These are wonderful recordings. But if you download the mp3, watch out: 1st movement of no. 24 is only 6 minutes, namely incomplete. Unless this is the case with the original CD (which is just unlikely), I find such a defect appalling. I'm so annoyed by amazon's careless rendering of mp3 files. This is not the first time I experience it."
Awesome! <SEP> Sweet original score of a new musical that's bound to get more fame as time goes on. Tells the story of Jeremiah the Prophet through instrument and voice. Lots of Irish sounding melodies back up by American sweeping themes through the orchestra. Very enjoyable!
One Star <SEP> Smells like mold and made my whole room smell moldy.
"The orchestra is virtual <SEP> The orchestra is not real, is virtual. The CD is recorded on a sampled (Vienna Symphonic Library)."
"Don't pass this one up! <SEP> This collection of living American composers compositions is really great!  If you aren't breathless after ""Gargoyles"", then you weren't listening!  Get it!  And don't forget his two CDs of Rachmaninoff as well.  You won't be sorry!  This is David at his very best!"
"A sagging, devitalized version of the Brahms First <SEP> andras Schiff has an unassailable reputation in Europe as a musician's musician, although that accolade often hides a certain""how to please everyone"" conventionality. Schiff is such a famous Bach player that I often expect him to be precise and even, falling short on passion and spontaneous expression. He would seem ill-suited to Brahms's high romanticism. Yet before he enters, in the long orchestral prelude, Solti lost me with his lax, underplayed reading of the second theme. By the time Schiff appears on the scene, considerable momentum has been lost (anyone who thinks of Solti as a firebrand is ignoring his ultra-respectability when it comes to the Austro-Grman classics). The pianist is also in a quietist mood, unfortunately, so the entire first movement is like swimming underwater. So much for two Hungarian temperaments throwing off sparks.

given such misplaced placidity, there isn't a reason to continue, but I went on. Solti starts the Adagio at a snail's pace, which even Decca's good sound and the orchestra's refined playing can't enliven beyond a certain point. The piano is given a long solo passage when it enters, but the tempo is so lagging that Schiff, who has a nuanced touch, is challenged to keep the long line going. He also seems rather detached, so there's not much intensity to latch onto. the best movement is the finale, since it is done conventionally and skillfully. Even here, however, you get very little sense of vitality. Did these two artists really want to make a recording of the Brahms First, with so little to say?"
"Not that good <SEP> I borrowed this one frow the local library, and expected great things from one of my preferred pianists Andrs Schiff. First track I heard was the Rondo, as it is my favourite part of the concerto. The sound however was very hazy and a strange kind of echo is heard, especially in parts where Schiff is making too much use of the pedal, which devastates the joyful, swift and mainly punctual performance this piece of music asks for. Off to the adagio then, which is beautifully played, but again lacks the clearness I'm looking for. I won't recommend this set for anyone new to Brahms; instead I'd try the GILELS/JOCHUM set from DG. This one provides crystal clear piano playing and a wonderful sound."
"colorful and highly personal style of instrumental music <SEP> In the late 70's and during the80s pop fans all over Europe knew Bernhard Potschka as a member of two of the most important groups in German pop history: the Nina Hagen Band, whose first album still is internationally considered the best release of a German pop act ever, and Spliff, the influential band from Berlin, whose six albums set new stadarts for the German scene.
In the years since Spliff disbanded Bernhard (Potsch) Potschka involved himself in many projects-as a producer, a musician and a composer. Meanwhile Potsch has built his own state of the art recording studio and nowadays divides his time between homes in Spain and Berlin. Since 1994 Potsch has been working on the tracks of The Journey"", his first solo-album, and it is in fact a journey, albeit a musical one: a journey through all the different styles of music which have had a meaning in his life so far - the classical music, on which he was raised as a child, the pop and rock music of the 60s, which he discovered as a teenager and the ethnic styles, which have broadened his musical vision in recent years. Potsch has merged all these influences in a rich, colorful and highly personal style of instrumental music, which impressively and very entertainingly unfolds in ten very varied originals on The Journey"""
David Scott's musical tastes cover a wide spectrum of styles <SEP> It's not uncommon to find pianoplayer Scott on a session in Los Angeles for a country artist and on a jazz gig later that day. Good music supercedes style or genre. David Scott has written for television and film where the composer's job is to support the visual scene. The songs on this recording stand on their own while the listener can recall or invent their own scenarios.
"Trendy sound, rocky hymns and soulful ballads <SEP> MayaMo presents her new Singer-Songwriter album A Singer's soul "".
She presents exclusivly self-compositions with trendy sound, rocky hymns and soulful ballads. Mo tells us true stories with true music - Thereby the employed voices & instruments are producing a captivating, incomparably and earthy sound. Mo's singular voice, the virtuose guitarplay of Michael Kelmer, the discreetly constituted Percussions by Jan Molge, and selected instruments like Violin & Cello, bringing closeness which you can feel on the skin."
"It is an imaginary sightseeing flight <SEP> like nobody has transferred it into music before: With gently grooving lounge sounds Robert Simon Thoma takes his listeners on his new cd ""Oberland"" on a tremendously atmospheric sound trip through beautiful Upper Bavaria. These nine tracks combine to a relaxing and inspiring musical journey through one of the world's most beautiful landscapes with all its historic sights - but without all those stereotyped clichs of Bavarian folk music.

This highly original and creative concept is the brainchild of a highly original and creative mind: The Munich based musician, composer and producer Robert Simon Thoma. The well established creator of score music for many tv- and radio-productions has already proven his talent to provide his listeners with spirituality and joy beyond all genre boundaries on his successful cd ""Winter"". Thoma has always used a variety of stylistic sources for his music, may it be rock, blues, metal, classical music, folk or diverse ethnic styles. On ""Oberland"" he blends sounds and stylistic elements from all over the world into a harmonic and melodious piece of art."
"Just awful <SEP> This garbage is the worst ""music"" ever. Plus, they did an awful photoshop job on their cover (not to mention they stole that picture)"
"Two Stars <SEP> Disappointed,pretty boring"
Five Stars <SEP> WORK!!!
"Beautiful <SEP> This is an amazing song.  If you have been a long-time fan of Kevin Matisyn, you will not be disappointed!  If you haven't yet heard of him, this is a great example of his beautiful work!"
Four Stars <SEP> Her voice is wonderful and I love it.
"Get the original <SEP> Not just re-mastered. A lot of the high notes have been removed and some of the music is different, all to the detriment of the song."
only yor sex <SEP> I think I like the glee cover of the song more than I like the actual artist for the song! Go Glee!
"Lovely and Relaxing <SEP> This CD is amazing and one of my favorites for resting, relaxation and sleep. The guitar tones are soothing and the pieces are well thought out and played perfectly. I highly recommend this album."
"For Adverts fans only? <SEP> Solid production and musicianship on this one, but not much in the way of great tracks.  You can hear one Adverts song in it's early stages, but that's not enough to recommend this CD.  For huge Adverts fans only....and that's even questionable."
OUTSIDE  INTRUDER <SEP> LOVE  THIS  SONG  I  JUST  CAME  ACROSS  SARKODIE  AS  A  ARTIST  BY  BEING  IN  TOUCH  WITH  A  FRIEND  OF  MINE  THAT  IS  FROM  GHANA  THIS  IS  HOW  I  WAS  INTRODUCED  ABOUT  SARKODIE  A  NUMBER  OF  HIS  SONGS  HAS  THAT  AFRICA  RHYTHM  LIKE  SARKODIE  (  WOULD  SAY  WHAT  TIME  IT  IS  ]  ITS  TIME  TO  BOGGIE  DOWN  AND  PARTY !
"Great compilation of josh and the band's work <SEP> Sad to see them parting ways, but this is a great way to build a collection quickly.  Such talent!  Josh is amazing!"
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful!!!
Five Stars <SEP> all good
"It's a Gem! <SEP> What a wonderful album! I purchased this album a couple of months ago and I find myself listening to it quite often. Every song on the album really is wonderful to listen to, but my favorite song on the album is Gold Hills. Its colorful lyrics and the way Muireann sings it so beautifully is truly inspiring! Other great, great songs that are my favorites of favorites are  S Ar Maidin Moch is M ar mo Leabain Bhoig, A Single Thread, and The Bold Fenian Men. This really is a great album, I would give it six or seven stars if I could."
"The wrong music. <SEP> The four tracks listed in this download are simply the wrong files.  While track one is the first movement of Brahms' 2nd symphony, tracks three and four are from other works, not the 2nd Symphony.  This is unfortunate.  Do not purchase this download."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent!
"Today's issues in Iran are all discussed here... <SEP> Kiosk, portrays the political and social events of today's Iran in a sound and voice that often reminds me of early days of Dire Straits.
The music is fresh and yet is classic blues and rock accompanying smart and sarcastic lyrics portraying very serious issues or problems that is today Iran.
Again, every time i hear Arash sing I picture Mark Knopfler singing in Farsi.
Highly recommended."
"She sings it perfectly <SEP> Written and sung by Christine McVie, she delivers a sound that warms the soul.  It's one of the most beautiful songs ever performed."
"This is just unnecessary. Bought it when I had to own every ... <SEP> Huge McCartney fan but get out of here with these four and five star reviews. This is just unnecessary. Bought it when I had to own every single Beatles product available. So, I know the record and its an easy pass."
Nice & smooth!! <SEP> A terrific song! Its great to see them back together and I cant wait to hear the rest of the album.
"Explosion <SEP> With the word of mouth of Beyonce' performing at the Super Bowl, and her reuniting with Destiny's Child, there is a lot going right now in the works for them. But musically, what Beyonce', Kelly and Michele are planning, it really isn't worth the money or the wait so far, either. Musically, they need a lot of work right now with their songs and their spirit. Nuclear, the lead single from the groups Love Songs hits album, is actually a waste from their voices. I really found this song to actually be a sleeper in harmony. It really doesn't have a distinctive style in voice and harmony. I hope that what Destiny's Child plans for the groups future, if there is one, there can be better than this nuclear explosion.

Song: D"
"Sean Price and Swave Seva..... <SEP> Swave and Sean kill this track. If your a fan of either, definitely cop this one."
One Star <SEP> The file is corrupted on my end. It plays the first 4 seconds of the song.
Virtuoso performance <SEP> Great groove with a killer chorus. Destined to be a blues classic.  Charlie Musselwhite's roaring harmonica provides a terrific counterpoint to Ben Harper's impassioned vocals.
"AMAZING CD! LOVE IT! <SEP> AMAZING CD !!! So happy I stumbled upon it.. They have covered some of the BEST songs beautifully! I bought it for my preschoolers. They have definitely been rocking out, right along with me! Excellent CD, would recommend it to fellow teachers and anyone with kids."
Daughter's Favorite <SEP> We just happened to stumble upon Choo-Choo Soul by watching Disney Junior. When this show came on our daughter who was 9 months stopped what she was doing to watch and sway to the music. It is very catchy and fun to listen too.
Two Stars <SEP> cute.
A blast from the past you will not regret . <SEP> You really want to hear this amazing man sing.  Before the spins and editing of modern recording.  An amazing voice with great presence.
"Great single! <SEP> It's been a while since a Cat Empire tune has impressed me as much as this one.  Great beat, hints of African and Latin music, and great vocals as always."
Beautiful Piano music soothing the soul <SEP> I felt in love with Shona's music when I first time listed on YT. She also play beautifully with sensitivity and  deep emotion I decide to purchase her music that I can listen anytime and anywhere and add to my mp3 player and save to my music library .Her music brings me to a wonderful world with smile and warm my soul no matter how my days goes. Her beautiful music comes from her beautiful soul that we can not miss it !
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song!
"bitter than ever! <SEP> After four listenings, as good music should, i like it more each time through. Plenty to chew on here: good song writing,  sweet arrangements, and kick-ass fiddle paying. equally good for road trips or cocktail hour. the singing suits the mood of the record, that of good storytelling. if you let it, you'll love this recording. five stars."
"5 star voice <SEP> Trixie has a beautiful, sultry, sexy voice that captivates your musical senses.  She is also a talented musician and song writer.  I love the beat in Never Enough and how, together with Trixie's voice, the song makes you want to move to the music. Trixie is the next big thing!!!!!"
A musical journey <SEP> Mr. Beasley and his crew take you on a relaxing journey where the music takes your mind! In today's world it's great to still be able to take your lady out for dinner and some romantic live music. Now you can take the band home with you! Thus will definitely put you in a lovers mood!
You're there <SEP> Very clear and realistic sound! It's like you are there with the players and singer.
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"what is this? <SEP> I was just trying to listen to the preview.  First off, it came up as an M3U file.  I don't even know what that is but it is not the MP3 it says it is in the description.  Secondly, when I tried to play it all I heard was white noise, like old analog TV static.  If that's what your looking for then goody for you but, I am just confused as to if that is what it is supposed to be or if the file doesn't work."
Nice song from this catalan formation. <SEP> Nice song from this catalan formation.
"George's biggest fan <SEP> Being George Harrison's biggest fan for 45+ years,I can easily say,(SAVE YOUR MONEY!). Don't buy this stuff. There is so much really great studio & live music out there,by George Harrison.but this isn't it. I had heard this concert before on bootleg albums,so my expectations were already low,but I thought I'd try it anyway. It's painful to listen to. The sound quality is terrible & I hate to say it,but George & his band were terrible too. 1974 was not a good year for George. This was the lowest point in his life & he had almost completely lost his voice. Drugs,divorce,law suits,smoking,& stress etc,took it's toll. I wouldn't pay $5.00 for these cd's."
Five Stars <SEP> Yay
Five Stars <SEP> Nearly better than the original!
What lost tapes? <SEP> This is a mismash of recordings on which George played.  The songs are fine.  The misleading cover and title are not.
Please don't buy this..................... <SEP> Please do not make the mistake i made .I thought this was the three from the Anthology playing at Georges house. This is just a collection of songs others have done which they have written.
"Nice Indian spiritual singing <SEP> It is one of a series of Music CDs published by SYDA Foundation.  The SYDA Foundation was the name of Swami Muktananda's organization and community.

The SYDA Foundation has released five or so music CDs. All the CDs have mentioned search name:  om namo bhagavate muktanandaya. The music CDs have some very nice Indian devotional music (Bhajans).  Some people lost interest with the SYDA Foundations as a result of some of their spiritual talks raising some controversy.

This music CD has no spiritual talks; it is just vocal & instrumental music.  The chants can be learned since they are done in a call & response fasion.  Their adverse philosophy was adopted from traditional India and brought to the west. So it was a challenge to understand the tradition in the way it was originally intended. Chanting is a very common & respected spiritual practice all arount India."
Five Stars <SEP> Just as described arrived just great deal great price many thanks!
"This One Gives Bootlegs A Bad Name! <SEP> This two disc set contains 50 tracks spread over two CD's and as I should've known better I am so tired of waiting for an official release of the Hollywood Bowl LP from 1978 to appear on compact disc I made the move and picked this up. The package looks good and also of note is  a professional recording produced for British TV that is found here from an:  04-11-65  show at the Empire Pool in Wembley that is a good sample of the Spring 65 show. The sound from Wembley isn't bad with the vocals mixed way above the instruments and there is no Ringo for the first few numbers but by the fourth song ""Ticket To Ride"" Ringo does appear in the mix and he rides the cymbals (to be heard?) on every beat. This snippet from Wembley is a good find.

Things take a bad turn at track eight where this collection becomes unlistenable with a very bad audience tape from Italy (June 1965) and as I hoped things would improve with other shows featured at the end of disc one it continues to become a mess of audience noise and talking with what sounds like a Beatles record being played at the wrong speed way down the road.

Disc two is a piece of sonic crap from start to finish with a Circus Krone show from Munich being the only thing you are going to be able to listen to and as this 06-24-66 show isn't The Beatles best performance the audio is way below the board tapes from Wembley found on the first disc so again you can play these first eight tracks from disc two but it isn't much fun to do so when there are excellent tapes of this era still sitting in the vaults for nobody to enjoy. After Munich there is nothing of the remaining seventeen tracks to waste your time upon as the sonics rate below zero quality as worthless and the radio voice-overs are about people in audience needing medical assistance and it's amazing that anyone would keep recordings such as this and believe they are of any value.

This is as bad as it gets and for everyone's enjoyment there is a five-star review of this collection found here and I do think we have found one of the bootleggers that manufactured this mess of a set. Go to your nearest donut shop and tell a cop about this guy before he re-releases this garbage yet again!

Nothing has yet been solved as there really is a market for live Beatles music and the Hollywood Bowl show (or Shea Stadium or Japan or anything decent!) needs to be released on compact disc but until it does indeed really happen the market will continue to be flooded with crap like this and that's a huge shame.
One Star (and it deserves ZERO stars!)"
"Poor substitute for The Beatles live. <SEP> I have purchased in the past, records as well as cd's of Beatle live performances, and though I do understand the difficulty it was to capture good sound quality from their performances, this cd has got to be one of the worst I must say. The majority of the songs are barely audible, and on top of that, so many of them are only half recordings of individual songs. These recordings are poorer than any of the recordings of The Beatles performances in Hamburg, before they were even famous. I do not recommend this cd to any fan.  Sam Duarte"
"She was amazing! -- so much energy <SEP> I first saw/heard Katie at the Boston Harbor Fiddle Camp visitor's night concert. She was amazing! -- so much energy, beautiful phrasing, great collaboration with other musicians, and a wide range of emotional expression. I love the album, and as another reviewer said, its on constant replay at my office right now!"
My forever love <SEP> This is a wonderful CD and I am very pleased that I was able to find it through you. It has wonderful classics. He picked the songs (covers) very well. I am very happy with it
"Boring <SEP> Sorry, but it's boring. Lacks vitality and depth of emotion. These two play like they're just fulfilling the terms of their record contracts. For a more satisfying reading look to Zukerman and Barenboim on DG.

P.S.: Recorded sound is fine."
"Glee Scrubs <SEP> Glee has definitely known how to make a good song, turn into chicken feed when they have done it. There were very few times they have shown they can make a song well. When they did a rendition of Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, it worked like a candle lighting a immortal flame of love for Whitney. But for TLC, they have really turned a song into a joke, especially over a decade after the death of Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes. Their rendition of the trio's No Scrubs' absolutely is definitely one of the weakest cover songs they have ever done. I think the cast of Glee really should've done what they have not, is make a song stand out, than feel like it was a waste of time.

Song: D-"
"Not the radio version <SEP> Not the version I thought.  This is obviously my fault.  I assumed ""clean"" meant that it was the version played on the radio.  It is not the radio version."
"Fun Upbeat <SEP> Great song! Clean Mix allows me to play it around the kids. At least when they (the kids) sing it, no one will be offended."
"Solid <SEP> Again, I bet you will driven towards the correct massive action while listening."
Five Stars <SEP> TY
Get this version <SEP> I think this is an outstanding version of the song. He had a heat and unique voice.
Ooops <SEP> Bought by mistake...and it was a mistake.  I don't like her voice.
Two Stars <SEP> I loved the music in the movie but the CD is awful..so much skipping..was very disappointed
"What A Steal! <SEP> This song/group is not receiving enough attention. This is the first song I've happened upon that I got excited about immediately upon hearing it.

Get some."
"Energetic music with staying power <SEP> It seems like many catchy, upbeat songs tend to have a short shelf-life to me.  I like them right off the bat, but end up tiring of them quickly.  Walk The Moon is different.  They have songs that are very energetic and easy to like, but over the past year+, I have only found myself listening to - and liking - Walk The Moon more and more.  Can't wait for their next release!"
Five Stars <SEP> Sadest song for times like these !
"Go Jimi <SEP> Good memories... So glad I found this one, it's great! The price was awesome too! Jimi & Janis my favorites."
"not as good as other <SEP> not the song I thought it was, not as good as other versions"
"Played <SEP> I like the theme song from True Blood so I bought Bad Things (The Theme From 'True Blood) here. Only to find out this IS NOT the theme song from True Blood but a different version. That I do not like. Contrary to the fact that it's advertised as (quote) Bad Things (The Theme From 'True Blood) (end quote) The $1.26 I got duped out of due to this misrepresentation won't break the bank but I don't like being played so it is irritating.
The actual theme song from True Blood is available at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Revelations/dp/B003J27WDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Revelations</a>
Correction The Red Revelations is also a different version True Blood theme song. Now I have two version that are not the True Blood theme song. Oh well it is what it is."
"Good Techno Grooves <SEP> I heard ""Night Is On My Mind"" on XM Radio, and had to find out more about Oliver. Good techno grooves, interesting beats, and catchy riffs. I like it! ""Night Is On My Mind"" remains the standout of the 4 tracks."
MechaniCAALLLL <SEP> I heard this in a commercial. it's pretty cool. It has that 80's synth feel. Need. five. more. words. word.
If you like Daft Punk you will like this! <SEP> I bought this one on a whim.  Totally love it.  I have listened to the tracks about 10 or 15 times so far.  If you like Daft Punk you will like this!  I am a fan.
"??????????? <SEP> One of my all-time favorite songs by Hendrix but this version sounds like it was clipped and pasted together, it doesn't sound like an actual Hendrix recording. I am pretty bummed about it , but I did give it 2 stars because I love the song."
Five Stars <SEP> Nothing like Jimi
Awesome! <SEP> Found this with my Prime membership. Awesome!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song.  No instruments needed.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome  awesome
Five Stars <SEP> I liked it.
"You can't miss something you've never had? <SEP> The DL process here with Amazon's ""cloud"" server is convoluted beyond imagination.  I have tried to DL this about a half dozen times with no luck.  The 'cloud"" dl app on my computer crashes before fully downloading.  Uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice but no luck.  Meanwhile I DL freely and easily off other sites."
"Five Stars <SEP> Stevie is hot, young or older"
"Five Stars <SEP> Great song, great sound."
Great Song. <SEP> Strong vocals by that raspy voice of Stevie Nicks makes this a great song.  Typical FM great rhythm.  Great back up from Lindsey Buckingham on this cut.
One Star <SEP> No stars if u have to join prime
"It was everywhere, but where I could find it! <SEP> Finally. Found out what the name of this sone was!!! Been trying to figure this out for over 10 years. I thought it was Fleetwood Mac, but did not know the name. Thanks!!!"
One Star <SEP> Great. Love sond worth listening to!
"The beautiful harmony of the Oak Ridge Boys shines in this song! <SEP> I am an old fan of the Oak Ridge Boys and have most of their cd's, but very few of their MP3's, so I am trying to gather their music in this way a little at a time so that I will have it to take with me wherever I go. I am not sure exactly why, but 'When Karen Comes Around' has always been one of my personal favorites of their many songs. They have many other songs that were major hits, far more than this song. But this remains one of my personal favorites. I guess it just speaks to me. Also it is a wonderful song that showcases their awesome harmony. And their wonderful harmony is one of my favorite things about all of their music. They used to come to our local arena at least once a year and I always went to see them (with friends). They are more amazing in person, although I believe they are retired now. They will always be a favorite group to me and many of their songs will remain my all-time favorites as well!"
Great band. <SEP> Great song.
Five Stars <SEP> One of the best
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song
Five Stars <SEP> good cd
"""la costa perdida"" is missing something <SEP> This is an uneven album.  At its best it is ""nice,"" with the sounds helping to evoke the theme of nostalgia/exile for California (and all California symbolizes), something many of us can relate to.  ""Northern California Gurls"" is the true highlight.  However, all in all CVB's trademark humor is lacking, and the violin isn't very present in the songs or even guitarist Greg Lisher's normally distinctive, soaring leads. ""New Roman Times"" is the more successful and powerful of the albums by the reformed Camper; ""La Costa Perdida"" is more like a companion record to Lowery's ""The Palace Guards""...which isn't a bad thing, but, again, it's more ""nice"" than great.  Unfortunately, there's little here that will strongly pull you back to listen to it again, unlike ""New Roman Times."""
"Not as funny as I would of thought, but that is my opinion. <SEP> I liked Craig's love-master bit a few years back, so I thought I would give this a try.  I listened to it twice and didn't laugh too much. I listen to a lot of comedy while and find some to be hilarious and some not so.  This is one of the not so.  Sorry, I wanted to like it."
"different type of Latin Hip Hop <SEP> very underrated group. Capitol I-Man/ Intellect and Sinful One as I remember them fondly were something different in Latin Hip Hop from Cali compared to Cypress Hill, Kid Frost or SoCal Latin groups and rappers like Lil Rob, Proper Dose, Knight Owl and before Psycho Realm or Tres Delinquents emerged into the mainstream in the mid 90s.  I heard of them in the early 90s when relatives from Southern California moved to Texas and Hip Hop and graffiti started making its way to Texas.
I was 13 yrs old when I first heard their album because all my cousins would play was West Coast rap. Compared to what else was out there that was West Coast or Rap in general was............different. haha, the production value for what it is wasn't to bad since it was an independent record label. The beats on all the tracks were funky and unorthodox. My favorite track on the whole album is 'Phonkie Melodia'. Very little Spanish is spoken except for a few tracks where its mixed with Spanish and English verses. Sinful One is the one who lays down those verses as I believe Intellect isn't as versed with the language.

Since this is their freshman album, you can tell they were developing their sound. Their second self titled album that came out 2 years later in 1996 was even better. the production value, beats, lyrics and everything else about it was a lot more hardcore and mature. This album compared to their second album I consider it more of a house party album of sorts. If you like latin hip hop, then this album is worth getting. The second album is light years ahead of this one and if you can find it (goodluck if you do) definitely get it too."
"Delightful! Sun Ra As He Mellowed In His Later Years,  More Generally Approachable Than Some Of His Earlier Work <SEP> My introduction to Sun Ra was his live performance at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival around 1992. My pal Ken and I were hearing people saying ""Sun Ra is here!"" and we were intrigued and headed over to the stage where he was about to perform. There was a big crowd, so the whisper campaign apparently worked. Pretty soon he and the band came out one at a time, some of them tumbling in their entrance while playing. The music was unlike anything I came across - atonal mixes with wild riffs and somehow this wasn't the chaos it appeared to be at first glance. It was hanging together in a great kind of way.

With that introduction I became a fan. By the start of the third piece many of the folks who didn't get the genius of Sun Ra and the Arkestra had been wandering off. Better for me and the good sized crowd that remained were clearly devoted fans. I didn't know this was going to be one of his last performances and I'm grateful I got to see him perform.

That night I picked up 2 Sun Ra albums: Blue Delight and Other Planes of There. Both were great.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Other-Planes-of-There/dp/B0000014JP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Other Planes of There</a>&nbsp;is from recordings (I think) in the 70's, but Blue Delight is more concurrent with the performance I saw and is reflected in the performance on the album. This album is more mellow than Other Planes and the music hangs together in a way that suggests long experience. Other Planes seems to be exploring relatively new territory while in comparison Blue Delight is guideed tour of musical explorations discovered and well known. It's the more comfortable and approachable of the albums for me.

Sun Ra is outstanding and I think he deserves to be better known. Give him a try! You may find you are a Sun Ra kind of person.

Hope this helps someone."
Five Stars <SEP> Great CD. You want be disappointed!
"Five Stars <SEP> Great Duet, great song"
Five Stars <SEP> Great meditation background tunes!
One Star <SEP> Wrong cd
"Lost  Concert <SEP> Poor quality, even though live"
Five Stars <SEP> absolutely my favorite
"Happy Reggae! <SEP> I'd heard just ""Sunshine"" by Matisuyahu on Slacker Radio and had to get more! I love Amazon Cloud because it works so seamlessly with my Sonos system. Back to the music - it's wonderful! Uplifting beats that make my feet move and wonderful lyrics. The acoustics are amazing, too, I'm glad I got this one. There are no ""bad"" or even ""so-so"" songs on this. Now I hear that on iTunes you get an extra track, so I took the review down from 5 to 4. Otherwise, great buy!"
Five Stars <SEP> Its RAWKS!
Five Stars <SEP> Great tune. Great album.
Hang em High <SEP> Amazing cover from an iconic movie and score...
OK unless you're a real fan you may want to pass <SEP> I guess I'm going to give up.  I loved Andrew Strong's voice in the committments.  His solo albums were a real disappointment.  I thought this would be a new take on the original sound track.  Andrew is there but the old magic is not.  The recording is thin.  The songs drag.  The recorded versions are not particularlly inspiring.
I love the beat! <SEP> Not a song for little young ears to hear. I really like the beat of the song but KEEP it in your adult collection so little ones and younger teenagers can't hear. I'd have to say 18 and up.
Four Stars <SEP> I love Tal's playing. And this is a very good example of his post-Clef years!
Five Stars <SEP> great collection
"Historical & Musical note on Carlos Montoya <SEP> Disclosure:  This is a 2006 revision my review written several years ago.

In his day, Carlos Montoya, a true Spanish Gypsy, was the most famous flamenco guitarist - the operative word being ""famous.""  He was a good showman, and audiences not knowledgeable of Flamenco enjoyed him.  However, amongst Flamenco professionals and serious aficionados, Carlos  Montoya was something of a joke.

In his very early days as an accompanist (c. 1933 - 1942), he was decently adequate.  When he  started concertizing as a soloist (due to a twist of fate rather than  talent and ability) most of what he knew as an accompanist seemed to  disappear:  He did things just for showmanship rather than for the music,  and his greatest sin was that he constantly butchered the compas - i.e.,  the particular rhythmic meter that most Flamenco forms demand.  Compas is  one of the absolutes within Flamenco, and no artist can call him/herself a  professional, much less be respected, if he/she cannot keep a decent  compas.  For this reason alone, Carlos Montoya's playing always drove the  real flamencos to distraction.

The true virtuoso of Carlos Montoya's generation was Sabicas, who unfortunately never attained nearly the same  degree of fame.

So  - many people may well enjoy this and Carlos Montoya's other albums.  But  be advised that none of his albums represent anything close to the best  flamenco guitar playing, either in his own generation or any generation  since.

Now another note I'm adding in this revision:  All that said, Carlos Montoya still had a passion in his playing, and that, despite the above flaws, is what always came through.  And beyond his playing, in my own experience, Carlos was affable, playful and ""muy simpatico.""  The few times I met him he was always very nice.  During my Jose Greco days, he sat in the front row at one of our conerts, and he was kind and complimentary afterwards about my solo.  That sort of generosity should not go unacknowledged.  Now that he and Jose - and Sabicas, Antonio Gades, Juan Maya, Mario Escudero, and so many others - have passed on, the flaws should not be buried, but the memory should be with respect and kindness.  I certainly will always remember Montoya in that way."
"Sarita's beautiful music and guitar playing <SEP> This album seems to be the only one ever recorded by Sarita Heredia, a multi-talented performer who plays the guitar, sings and dances. A musician with her unique talents should have a much wider audience than what seems to be the case, but no matter. The recording shows a flamenco guitarist who can play with the best of them and has all the techniques necessary to express the fiery rhythms and feeling of this exotic Andalusian folk art. The linear notes for some pressings for this album claim that Sarita was recorded during a live performance but that doesn't seem to be the case. At any rate, this album should be a favorite of aficionados of flamenco guitar."
"I Love Blly Joe Shaver <SEP> This man has a distinctive style that I just love. It is honest and forthright,  Just a wonderful listen.  Thanks"
"One of the first LP's made of all Steve Allen Songs <SEP> Bob DiNeri is a fine baritone and Steve Allen knew it. That's why Steve produced this very early 1956/57 LP for the budget label Tops records. There are a number of stand out songs. Among them are; ""Houseboat"" and my hands down favorite ""So Be It"" This a really great lyric and Bob sings it perfectly.  I knew Steve Allen and he was a multi-talented wonderful gentle-man. His greatness is very much missed today.

This is a fine unfairly forgotten singer who does much justice to Steve Allen songs.

"Just got to finish my collection <SEP> Instrumental. I don't listen to IG for instrumentals, so I do not care for it. The music itself is ok, but even then it's not a very good representation of IG music."
"This is not the whole disk/album, just one track (the first one) <SEP> It seems that the whole album is not available by mp3, and this was the only thing available.
I downloaded it from Amazon mp3.  It is misleading because some sites have some of the afterdark
compilations available as a single track-whole mix (whole album) for the price of one track.  This
is not that."
Really great music. So glad I found these guys <SEP> Really great music.  So glad I found these guys.
Two Stars <SEP> Not the one I Wanted
"Techno Meets House <SEP> Audiojack Can Go To Their Lab, And Create Some Of The Best Rockin' Club Music Out There On The Scene. This Jam Has A Little Bit Of House, Techno, & Club, S___ That's Why I'm A Little Schizo On This One Here.. I Was Going Bananas, But The Cut Is Cool.."
Original Tunes <SEP> I found this on Spotify - I have no idea who C2C is... but this is original music.
Great <SEP> Super awesome peppy happy song that will definitely get your foot tapping. A lot of fun and positive energy. Great!
Five Stars <SEP> GD <3
"Five Stars <SEP> Great album. Glad I ordered it. Many great duets, including with his wife, Faith Hill."
Four Stars <SEP> Liked it but actually very little he does isn great
"Yes. It is GOOD. <SEP> This is the upbeat, high energy version of a very sweet song -- and somehow the high energy and the lyrics all fit together -- and I like it much better than the same song as a duet on Rend's Campfire album. ---Even with the modern wording (You for Thou, etc.), it did not disappoint!"
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent CD. Enjoying it very much!
New kind of funky and eclectic!!! <SEP> Truly unique style on this track!! This artist takes the audio and vocal dubs to an extreme level... I saw it on the Misfits show and decided to download it.... the video on youtube is interesting too!!
"The best feeling in the world is when the one you ... <SEP> This song get me to the level of what Beyonce and Jay Z had for Bonnie and Clyde or TuPac in Me and my bitch!
The best feeling in the world is when the one you married to is down for whatever and got yo back and submit!!! Fuken Sexy As Hell"
Two Stars <SEP> Over it.
"I thought I would really like this song because I love Paramore <SEP> I thought I would really like this song because I love Paramore, but it just seems like bubblegum to me now.  Only for the diehard fan I think."
What the heck? <SEP> This is so bad... so so so bad - compared to riot and everything else this is not good. I think it is time for the band to hang up their guitars and mic's - paramore is dead.
Very Good Track <SEP> Quite an enjoyable track. Gets more than a fair amount of play on the MP3 player. It's hard not to dance when it plays.
great new single <SEP> Loving now cant stop listening to it really looking foward to the new album for sure day 1 buy for me
Two Stars <SEP> The music is nice but not it's not suitable for sleep.
My favorite version of this classic <SEP> The instruments present a beautiful jazz version and Marias's voice adds the passion. Lo recomiendo a todas.  I highly recommend it especially for jazz lovers.
"it's not smooth, steady white noise. <SEP> I regret purchasing this, it is not ""smooth"", there are ""surges"" that having a looping pattern to them.  i find that very distracting when i'm trying to sleep.  background office noise, fine.  but if you are trying to sleep it's annoying."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Brahms from Klemperer - the orchestral works date from the 1950's.
"Bargain Set Includes Some Classic Accounts <SEP> This budget-priced 4-CD set is a formidable bargain.  Klemperer interprets Brahms as rugged and dramatic, clearly Beethoven's heir in symphonic composition.  His approach works especially well in the First and Fourth symphonies, as well as in the classic account of the German Requiem.  The Second and Third symphonies are not quite as convincing, and occasionally suffer from abrupt (and unnatural-sounding) changes in tempo.  The recordings (from the 1950's) are good for their time, but more modern versions allow the listener to hear more inner details of the music (and these scores are full of inner details!).  The orchestral playing is generally good, though there are a few wayward moments from the winds.  Overall, there are some great performances here, and admirers of Brahms should not hesitate.  Notes are included, but there are no texts for the two vocal works."
"READY? <SEP> luv Loso, the song has not grew on me yet, hope the album is better than the lead single. have all his cd. mixtapes since 98."
quality <SEP> Amazon music always has the best quality music and the fact when you download the songs through the mp3 player they go straight to your music library. Very easy to find the music to play!
I don't recommend. <SEP> Not my cup of tea.
"Speaking in tongues was never so practical or enjoyable <SEP> What the world needs now is more beautiful ballads that make sentiment, sorrow and fear step up and take their place at the last supper.  Just want to sing this one in church on Sundays, then maybe I wouldn't feel so alone."
"too old school style for me <SEP> Belongs in the early 90's, they missed the mark with this.  I am more of a fan of R&B, so consider that in following my recommendations."
"Unused <SEP> i don't really listen to this song because it didn't really catch me, but if its your sort of thing then i say go for it."
Not the video version <SEP> I've only seen the video version of the song. This is not it and I don't care for it. I don't think you can return downloads though so I guess I'm stuck with it. There's about 8 versions of this song I have no idea which is the video one.
"Fun <SEP> Fun song to dance to. I added it to my Zumba routine. Haven't gotten sick of it yet, every time I hear it, it puts me in a good mood."
"Great Prose That You Can Dance To <SEP> It's the great, verbose, somewhat dark stories that you expect from Frightened Rabbit, but they're still delivered in a way that isn't morose."
"hm <SEP> well i vibed to this music for a while, but i found the lyrics decent, and kind of gross, oh well"
"Bad CD <SEP> The songs are great, I love Norah Jones.  However, when I try to play the CD, it skips a song and when I place it in my PC and play it, while looking for cover art to ad to my CD Library on my computer, everything comes up in Chinese or Japenese.  Very disappointed."
"Ahhh Cory Monteith <SEP> I bought this song as I was using it for a New Year's slide presentation.  The song is great, the voices remind me of the show and brings back good feelings.  And then I think, ahhh, Cory is dead, so sad."
Beautiful <SEP> The Glee cast did a beautiful tribute to this song while keeping the original feeling.
"So unique <SEP> I love this album! Thenewno2 gives such an unheard, fresh tilt to the music and that's great for score lovers like me. After a while, you feel like you've heard the epicest, most heartbreaking music out there, but then these little gems come along and remind you why you love music in the first place."
Five Stars <SEP> Great
Quality sound <SEP> Good quality recording of  an old favorite from the 90's. And it's cheap enough so I can replace my scratched CD.
"Uncle Charlie <SEP> What can you say, the man is incredible, I have to keep my sons from stealing my CD, and my phone. When you have class, style and a voice that can say it all, what can anyone say than Charlie Wilson. Keep smiling Charlie."
Real Talk <SEP> Must have!!!! Anyone can relate to this single......if you want to get hype right before a workout or just a ride out song this is it!!!!
"One of the best bands from the USA in a long while! <SEP> I heard about these guys on the metalweb ring. I hit their website, then bought the CD. Amazon.com UK didn't handle it, but I still got it. Anyway, these guys are great. Their style of music is a cross between  Maiden/Metallica. Melodic&Heavy. Good vocals. Great Bass playing. Not  all that steady one note thumbing that has become sooooo popular amongst US  bands. And they're not all that speed and growling. I'm sure this band will  acumalte great fame in the near future. If you like MUSIC!  Than buy this  CD. There is a song for everyones taste on it."
love it! <SEP> I love romantic songs in certain periods of my life (like now) and these vocals and words are the best!
"Better than original <SEP> I actually like this mix better than the original. I think the singer has a great voice and like how it was put together. The only downside is the fact that they went the PC route and made the lyrics unisex, but what else should I expect from Glee. Other than that it is very well done."
Pure cheese. <SEP> Pure cheese. Makes me feel like an overly pompous person writes the music. Complete over produced crap disguised as folk rock.
Four Stars <SEP> Love it!
HATE IT! CANT DELETE <SEP> BOUGHT BY ACCIDENT COULDNT DELETE
"awful, not worth buying! removed the songs immediately ... <SEP> awful, not worth buying!  removed the songs immediately!"
"Soothing, calms the nerves, excellent. <SEP> This is a stressful world  and the amount of work one has to complete each day is enormous. It is such a pleasure when  I come home, to switch on the computer and lean back listening to ""Love Song Classics."" Within a few minutes, I have forgotten the problems and  floating in the melodious sounds of these classic pieces. Of cause listening to classical pieces is my passion, is my delight and is my mental medicine, I do  wish others could crave for this gift. If it is not your gift, then seek for it; crave for it; desire for it--I assure you that it will  be yours eventually."
This is NOT the one with Missy Elliott. <SEP> This is NOT the one with Missy Elliott.
Four Stars <SEP> Solid CD from timeless musician.
One of his best <SEP> Uncle Charlie does it again.  The man is timeless and so is his music.  I have it on repeat!  Sensational.....!!!
"Exquisite <SEP> Falcon has a unique and incredible voice--rich, soulful, playful, haunting, vulnerable and self-assured, all at the same time. The songs are beautiful, too--gorgeously melodic. I love this CD."
One Star <SEP> Hipster garbage
"Rubbish <SEP> This album was awful, I couldn't tell what it was trying to achieve and frankly, I am not surprised after finding out the ""artist"" (and it pains me to use the word to describe this idiot) is nothing more than a thief."
"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS THIEF!!! <SEP> Save your money. Chad ""Love"" Lieberman, Democratic Presidential hopeful JOSEPH LIEBERMAN's nephew, also known as Craig Pravda is a thief. He has stolen thousands of artworks from Deviantart, DC Comics,  even selling them for hundreds of dollars on his web page art4love.com, but he changed the domain to <a href=""[link]>markyourspot.com and now he has erased the domain, but can still be found at 67.90.44.118/.
His new websites are michaelperezgallery.com, electcollect.com,

He says he is a pop artist but he only sells the art of others like it was from himself and hurt the artist community."
"I LOVE IT! <SEP> I love this song. I heard for the first time about a week ago. I immediately looked it up on Amazon. I found it, downloaded it, and have been listening to it on my phone and my tablet everyday!!!"
"This is not the new age achillea <SEP> This is not the new age chill out achillea.  It is some hard rock or metal band that made a cover that looks like an achillea cd and amazon is lumping it in with all the chill out and new age cds like conjure one, sleepthief, delerium, etc."

"Fantastic Album! <SEP> Blair's ""Die Young"" is an utterly fantastic album.  Having heard a few of her songs on satellite radio, I decided to spring for the whole album and I was not disappointed.  In terms of comparison points, it's hard not to compare her to Feist and her most recent album (The Reminder), but I dare say that I think Blair's album is better.  It contains a number of ""Indie"" friendly tunes such as ""Rampage"" and ""Hello Halo,"" but what is most striking is the album's consistency...every tune is well worth your time.  Both the music and lyrics are very well done, and the best description I can give is that it sounds like an ""Indie Rock"" version of ""Singer-Songwriter"".  A fantastic album, and I hope a great beginning to a great career for Blair.  Get it, you won't be sorry."
One Star <SEP> Skips like ass
"Brilliant First Album <SEP> It was the first of Sharon Needles' albums, and you can tell she was getting her foot in the door. However, the brashness was there. She's unabashedly her, and she doesn't care. It's that attitude I so admire. I wish everyone had it, and it's my hope her music will inspire others. Speaking of the music alone, it's dancy, it's catchy - it's a little treble, but, again, it's a first attempt. It's like ""A New Hope"" leading up to ""Empire Strikes Back"" ... and oh, yes, she DID."
Great Song <SEP> Really love the lyrics on this track. Truly inspiring. The guitar is awesome too. Looking forward to more songs from this artist.
"Samples can be misleading. <SEP> I bought it because the sample was very soft.
I do not like it because it becomes very loud.

Samples are often TOO SHORT; too many vocals (mostly older) have instrumental intros that take up the entire sample."
Great scarf! <SEP> Thick and soft Batman scarf. Love it! Better than I expected. Would buy from this seller again.
"TOP TALENT! <SEP> This girl (and she was only a girl when she recorded this album, the youngest person ever to commercially record the Chopin Etudes) is a true phenomenal talent! She has genuine emotional expression in her playing along with a surefire technique. She's a top talent and I predict great things for her. She is also a composer, and, hence, plays with the musical intelligence of such. DON'T MISS THIS RECORDING!!"
One Star <SEP> whomp whomp
"Where's the production value? <SEP> Look, I have saved this vinyl lp since I first bought it way back when.  I had transferred it onto CD some years ago.  I love this album and Minus Plus, as well.  But I have to be honest.  The sound quality is just not here for the MP3 version.  The sound is very weak, and has not been digitally enhanced in the least.  I'm very disappointed.  It makes me appreciate my original transfer even with it's pops and scratches.  I wish someone would respect this album as much as I do (as well as Minus Plus) and do it justice with a decent reproduction."
"Four Stars <SEP> Great song, got popular after it was used in Easy Rider and included on the sound track."
deceived <SEP> I was deceived in buying these I thought I was getting the real all American rejects. It was even placed higher in the search results but this remix does not do it for me
"Is It You or better yet Are You The One???? you decide! <SEP> Finally released! ! I have personally called the song writer ang requested that this song be made available for purchase and was turned down. This song was first heard in the movie "" The Boat Trip"" starring Cuba Gooding Jr a in scene where he is dancing with the ship's choregrapher, although it was very short scene it was very provacative, sexy and the song was and still is amazing. Just glad Brad Segal released it. Thanks! Great song!"
Party with Poolside by Michael E <SEP> I am a smooth jazz and Michael E. fan. Loved this song enough to use it in my YouTube video - Clouds at Play!
Doesn't play <SEP> There is something wrong with this item. It does not download as an MP3. I am going to have to contact customer service.
"Disappointed <SEP> Love the song ""Demigodz Is Back"" so it made me want to pick up the album on sale for 4 dollars. Sadly, There was not a single song other than that one that I liked on this album. It was just a generic rap album that failed to have any stand out tracks on it."
Five Stars <SEP> Great live performance.  Love all things Zappa!
"Not loud enough, it comes on and I have ... <SEP> Not loud enough, it comes on and I have to increase the volume, it ends and I have to turn it down."
"must listen <SEP> came a cross this song. after listen to, i had to buy the rest of the music. love it!!! won't stop listen"
"A fun listen <SEP> Had a good time listening to this album.  I have heard Keith's other albums so I kind of knew what to expect.  If you are easily offended by dog poop jokes, civil rights analogies and paint huffing, then you may not like it as much as I did, but you should still buy it to be nice.  Apparently Keith is poor.

I initially thought that it seemed a bit short, but when I checked the play time and found it was over a hour long, I thought ""Hmm, well maybe it was just that good and it just seemed short"".  Now I will have to go back and listen again."
"Wrong song <SEP> I didn't get Yankee Doodle Boy, I got some Shirley Temple song. I needed YDB for a 70 year old's birthday party. He was born on July 4th, but didn't get to hear the song."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent product
"Not so Good. <SEP> This song is not good at all, I only got this song because it was free but I did not like it at all. I only listened to the song about once or twice."
"Horrible <SEP> Sounded like a bunch of kids singing....need to make it clear that not only are the real artist singing the songs, but that none of the songs sound remotely close to the artist's voices."
"DO MOT WASTE YOUR MONEY <SEP> This album is NOT THE ARTISTS, It's a cd of covers of popular country songs. I emailed asking for a refund and still have lot heard back. It's been over a week.
I was so excited to get so many great songs for such a great price. Too good to be true. This is a waste of your money."
singers sucked <SEP> I guess I should have paid more attention.  I didn't realize this is a cover album and the singer quality was so bad
Knock off not the real artists <SEP> I did not realize this is songs that are not the original artists. Very disappointed. You get what you pay for!
Disappointed <SEP> I was naive and didn't realize that the songs on this album are not performed by the artists who made them famous.  I was very disappointed.
"NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS - BEWARE!!! <SEP> If you don't mind that these are bad covers and not the original artists, buy all means make the purchase. Just be aware - you get what you pay for...."
One of the only songs on the cd that actually ... <SEP> One of the only songs on the cd that actually lives up to the standard of Dctalk & appreciates their legacy. Also the song makes you wonder where 4th Avenue Jones went (if you're familiar with them)
"So great... <SEP> Billy Vera is a national treasure! I first heard this song in the great Bruce Willis / Kim Basinger movie ""Blind Date."" Billy and the Beaters were the house band at the disco they went to. (He was also in the 80's series ""Wiseguy."") Any BV song is usually a good one, but this is just about his best. Simply a perfect ballad."
"Amazingly beautiful! <SEP> WOW, just downloaded the album...originally downloaded two of the tracks on Friday and went back on Sunday and downloaded the rest of the album. Couldn't stop listening to it in the car! Cup of coffee, Christmas shopping and some great tracks from December Five & Twenty. Very well done!"
One Star <SEP> JUNK
"Five Stars <SEP> again I love the music, I'm the bluzman! it's all good, thanks."
"I tried and triedto play ""Brazil"" and a ""Taste of ... <SEP> I tried and triedto play ""Brazil"" and a  ""Taste of Honey"" and ""Maleguena"" and other songs kept coming up.  ""Sweet Embraceable You"" and other unrelated songs. It will not play the titled list for the album. Romantic Latin Favourites."
Love <SEP> Carrie is a great singer. I've talk to her personal and she has a real Love for her music. This CD is just one of her great loves...
Great song from a great band <SEP> Great song from a great band. I'm disappointed that none of the local oldie stations ever seem to play it.
"disappointed <SEP> Live or on You Tube, the girls are great.  Recording doesn't capture their spirit.  Mix of songs on the CD doesn't allow spotlight for their talent."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
Five Stars <SEP> Vintage Paul Hardcastle. Dude just keep cranking it out.
"I tend to feel better buying things legitimately then finding the mp3s for a ... <SEP> As hard as it can be to fined, let alone buy a music cd from a band oversees that may not be so mainstream finding & buying this on amazon has made the process substantially easier. I tend to feel better buying things legitimately then finding the mp3s for a foreign band through copy past methods.

I've actually been enjoying Undead Corporation's music for a bit over a year now after stumbling over there work on youtube & I was delighted to find that this particular album could be purchased. Good rock from across the globe.

Although some folks may not like the Engrish of this band's lyrics you must understand that they are Japanese & English is not their first language. This in no way should put a damper on the music if you have searched for it this far though."
"BROKEN CASE. <SEP> The CD itself if good, I love the songs and I love scandal. I am however disappointed because I received a broken case. Judging by the outside, you can't tell but you open it and the circle that holds the discs in place are broken, both of them. So the discs slide around freely which I fear will ruin the CD."
"Surprisingly, one of Scandal's best albums <SEP> You probably wouldn't expect a collection of b-sides to make for a very good album, and for some bands, it wouldn't.  But Scandal has always put a little more effort into their b-sides than a lot of bands - they're not filler, they're a value add; a way to sell more singles. Some of their b-sides have become among their most popular songs - and one of them (""Satisfaction"") was even being used in a Windows 8 TV commercial in Japan.

For me this album was kind of a slow burn... I wasn't sure what to make of it until about the 8th or 9th track, at which point I suddenly realized ""wow, this might be my favorite Scandal album.""  It really grew on me.  Their b-sides are often a little different from their singles or album tracks, though some would be right at home on any of their studio albums.

Some songs sound a little experimental, while others might just have a sound that doesn't quite fit with other albums they have, and still others actually are pretty straightforward and catchy - you wonder why these latter tracks were ever banished to b-side purgatory in the first place. Highlights for me include Mami's amazing heavy blues track ""Want You"" (which Haruna sounds *incredible* singing), Rina's ""Emotion"", Mami and Rina's ""Hikare"" (see a pattern here?), the poppy but still rocking ""Shining Sun"", and of course the rap-rock ""Koshi Tan-Tan"" (even if it is an Offspring 'homage' and totally ridiculous). But honestly, all the songs are at least good.

I'm always impressed by the songs the girls write themselves.  This is uncommon for ""girls bands"" in Japan (patriarchal society), but the few times they have written both the music and lyrics to a song, they are always legitimate high points of any album - even before I look up to see who wrote the track. Their writing style may often be a little too serious for the regular albums - their own songs are less catchy and poppy than most of what's on their albums, but deeper and more satisfying.  Rina's songs are usually a bit melancholy; Mami's are usually dark and heavy.  I wish they'd write more of their own music.  It's great to hear three completely Scandal-written songs on this album, though most are still at least co-written by outside writers.

This album's also a reminder of just how great of a singer Tomomi can be when she's not using her Minnie Mouse voice. The real showcase for her is ""FUTURE"", which goes all the way back to the ""Shoujo S"" single and that's how she sounded in those days - much different than she does now.  You can even hear the progression as the album goes on.

When you put everything together you get a pretty eclectic album that's obviously Scandal but doesn't really sound like any of their other albums. Everything's held together by the fact that all the songs totally rock.  There's no ""Pin Heel Surfer"" or ""Kill the Virgin"" on this album, two songs from their previous studio album ('Queens are Trumps') that were so poppy and light on the guitars that it was almost cringeworthy.  Some songs on this album are a little punk, some are a little more pop, some are kind of bluesy, but they all rock. This album spans their entire career, which accounts for some of that.

If you're a superfan and have all the singles, then you have 16 out of the 17 songs on this album.  But I'm probably as big a fan as there is in the west and I don't have most of these.  Japanese singles are expensive in the west and most of them aren't available for download on Amazon.  So I'll bet this would be the first time most people here have heard the majority of these songs.

I actually like this album better than SCANDAL SHOW, which is the a-side ""best"" singles album counterpart to this. They have some classic singles but I do have 90% of the songs on that album already, and somehow I feel like that collection doesn't quite hang together as a cohesive album of its own.  This one does.  Maybe it's mostly because I don't have any other context for these songs, or maybe they just really are a better overall collection.  In any case, this is a great album and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Scandal."
Owl!?? Not so much. <SEP> Track 7. That s NOT an owl!!! It's a common Mourning Dove!. Sheesh!
"smokin <SEP> Paul Hardcastle tracks are always smokin,hv been listening to him for 20+years. Some are gonna sound better than others,but in the end,if you like Paul,than you just know that,cause that's the way music is,and that is no big deal."
"I got nothing. <SEP> The song never worked and it still does,t work, thanks for nothing."
"This is a great song, but it's not the song listed <SEP> This is a great song, but it's not the song listed.  This is ""Reaping Death"", not ""The Return of the Darkness and Evil"".  I wish it was, but oh well."
"Beau Soir <SEP> Barbra Streisand's rendition of Beau Soir, by Debussy is extremely pleasant to listen to.  I believe that Barbra Steisand sings im ,amu genres.  This is magnificent."
"Wrong song... again. <SEP> Again, this is not ""Reaping Death"".  This is actually ""The Return of the Darkness and Evil"".  It appears that the two songs have been transposed in the digitization process.  Now, the song itself is brilliant, as is ""Reaping Death"", despite being improperly labeled."
"I've found it to be the best medicine to remedy stressful work days <SEP> As an aspiring music journalist, I've found it to be the best medicine to remedy stressful work days.  Thanks!"
"I'm not technically reviewing the product because I was never ... <SEP> I'm not technically reviewing the product because I was never able to hear it! The product didn't play when I clicked the sample. Other samples have been playing so I know it's not an issue with my computer. I was interested in checking it out, but, oh well!"
"Just really really bad <SEP> Omg if there was ever an album I hated that made me wanna smash my phone, its this one. Was working out and put this on while on the treadmill. The one really really bad song in particular, never ever getting back together. Probably one of the worst versions of that song Ive ever heard. This whole album is just bad. Really bad."
"Loud talking in the middle <SEP> I thought this was going to be a cool sound effect for a presentation I was creating, and then halfway through suddenly somebody talks in a loud voice. I read that it said talking, but I thought it would be in the background. It was very loud, not quiet at all, and it messes up the mood. I would not recommend."
"waste of money had to give one star to post <SEP> Big mistake. ..waste of money
had to give one star to post this"
AMAZING <SEP> This album is super solid! I love it. And I'm happy to support this band. They have a great message.
"Beautiful <SEP> I first heard this album at a friend's party. The music set the mood, and we all felt alive - glad to be here."
"One Star <SEP> As the other reviewer said, that is not an owl. It's a mourning dove. Disappointing."
That's not an owl!! <SEP> That's not an owl; that's a dove!
Five Stars <SEP> House music at it's best.
Definitely NOT her best work but given her personal history it's worth a ... <SEP> Definitely NOT her best work but given her personal history it's worth a listen just to get to hear what makes this amazing artist who/what she is.
meditation <SEP> I use this as meditation.  The music is beautiful and rich.  It helps me to focus on the breath while keeping household noises from my attention
Good stuff <SEP> Great music and very talented group.
Great New Song! <SEP> Jewel's done it again.  Great song.  She has such a pretty voice and her songwriting is quite strong.  Fans of Jewel will want to download this song.
"Two Stars <SEP> It's not showing in my library, what's up with that?"
"A good song. <SEP> Heard this on the TV while watching CSI NY.  I liked it and so I bought it.  I checked out the other songs from this artist, but I'm glad I only bought this MP3.  Its a good song, and a high quality MP3."
One of my favorite artists <SEP> Josh is always at his best when he sings in foreign languages. Wish he would record more from the operatic genre.
Meh <SEP> I am not sure you can hear the P. Annies much.  Jewel at one time was my favorite singer and it morphed into Miranda Lambert over times.  Them together and I was like Score.  But its just bad.
"Love Jewel!! <SEP> I love Jewel's sound and lyrics.  She's so talented!  I loved her first album way back when.  The stories in her lyrics were often sad, but well written."
A Winner <SEP> Truly a great song!  Josh Groban has done it again with his inspiring music.  The entire albumn is worth  purchasing.
Five Stars <SEP> Badass!!
"About time... <SEP> I really only liked KSE with Jes. I heard them for the first time when he was still in the band, Howard kind of ruined them for me, so glad he's back. This will probably be one of there best efforts. Sounds like it"
Awesome <SEP> Great album!  Can't say I listened to it quite as much as I was expecting but still really good stuff from KSE and it's awesome hear Jesse back.
Five Stars <SEP> I have never heard Josh sing a bad song and this is a good song.
"Rising Quickly <SEP> Very nice, beautiful voice with the perfect song to go with it"
Five Stars <SEP> Eyes wide open!
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
Five Stars <SEP> Nice love the lyrics!
Hoping For Something Better <SEP> I truly love this musician and I love his musical mind. I love the fact that he pushes the musical boundaries. The studio album was OK. However this was to me simply boring. I love the interplay between the musicians. That is true music- working off of each other. This was him and the robots. Was hard to get into it. I'll keep it before I put in a garage sale.
"Nit what I wanted <SEP> Want the song, not just the music, ended up ordering two trying to get the song, don't like you music ordering system"
"Skipping <SEP> Sounded great until it was played to be used in Worship service.
Toward the end it was playing twice on a delay so sounded like there were two different songs being played.  Will have to repurchase it somewhere else."
"Beautiful melody and harmony! <SEP> Wonderful, Relaxing music... for anyone that loves early Christian music!"
"Anyone who listened to Ella must listen to this Album, along with this Great Big Band <SEP> Wow! she is another Ella. Deborah has that phrasing,  and the Band that backs her up is ""Great""( I wonder if the band is from England,
Sandviken BB or Germany)?"
"Very unsatisfying <SEP> The first movement of Elgar's Sonata in G, Op. 28 is an incredibly challenging piece, requiring technical skill and a well thought out approach to tempo changes and registrations. I give John Butt two stars for being able to play it but this performance just doesn't generate any excitement. Some of the tempi are too fast for any room, and certainly too fast for the Chapel at King's College. Registrations at times were not logical or convincing. There were at least a couple of places where I felt he had actually missed hitting a piston at the right time. To me, this performance sounded more like a practice session where he was still experimenting with tempi and registrations."
"Music is good - dvd is not <SEP> Music itself if great, 5 star, but production of this disk is simply not professional.
First, this is just a re-mastering of the old recording released by Philips in 2003. So, if you already have old 5- channel SACD, as I do, there is absolutely no reason to buy this one.
Second, this is not a professionally printed DVD, it was made on a computer using Blu-ray writer. The package includes just a DVD in a cheap jewel case. There is not booklet or any inserts. If you put this DVD into a player, you do not know what it should play. The only hope would be to have some information on the screen, but there is none.  When it plays - it just displays `track 1' as so on. There is no excuse not to put at least some track info onto this DVD. You could put actually a lot of info into the disk itself having such a flexible format and I do not understand why Acoustic Reality missed this opportunity. As it is if you do not know music score well you have no idea what you are listening to.
Very disappointing..."
Five Stars <SEP> I liked
"Five Stars <SEP> great CD. I am an avid collector of instrumental music, including jazz, new age, classical and holiday"
Four Stars <SEP> For kiddies it is genuenly entertaining
"Regurgitation <SEP> The same ol thing from the same old person. Such a waste of talent. I am not really a fan but I a friend let me hear love, lies, and lust. Well done! This this...straight up garbage!"
"Very sexy and adult. <SEP> My husband and I love this song, it is sexy and adult.  We find it to be tasteful with out the recent vulgarity that is played on public radio."
Five Stars <SEP> fabulous!
captured <SEP> I am friends with some of the band members this track captures their true talent. Anyone should be so lucky to have it in theor own music collect.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent Album!
Cute little Diddie <SEP> This song is included in my daily playlist.  I really enjoy listening to it EVERY time. Reminds me of a Saturday afternoon in New Orleans. Great horn arrangement and soothing vocals by Jesse Dee.  Would definitely recommend.
"Runs fine <SEP> Runs fine. The music is good if you like his type music. My opinion, he is overrated and you will find many artist you like better."
"An obvious waste of money since even the Brahms is not the ... <SEP> I'm sorry to say that this is NOT Bruckner but three of four movements from Brahms Sym. 2. An obvious waste of money since even the Brahms
is not the whole work. I'm sorry to report a negative review, but it is not what is advertised."
DC Forever! <SEP> Quite possibly the greatest album ever recorded...  <>
"Masterful playing, but the sound... <SEP> When I first came across the scores of this Italian master, Marqo dall Aquila, I could not believe what I found! Almost a century before Dowland, this unique composer wrote pieces with the same emotional depth and technical complexity as the later English master. So my expectations for this recording were great. I was maybe a little disappointed by the very fast tempos that O'Dette has chosen all over, I do not think the music was played this fast at all. But ok - I could live with that, this is very skillful playing, you can hear that from the first note. But the sound of this recording is horrible, with a reverb that kills the music totally, and I can never listen to more than one or two tracks. Actually I get a headache - and this is not a metaphor. This music and this musician had deserved better. The playing will get four stars from me, the sound - none."
Disastrous <SEP> The sound of this CD is the worst I have ever heard for a solo lute recording. That it is a Paul O'Dette performance that is so disfigured by the engineering makes this all the more disastrous. The confusion of the sound amidst the shockingly bad reverberation makes this CD almost unlistenable in my opinion. This will be the first O'Dette recording to be excluded from my collection. Dire.
"Jesse Dee is a great performer. <SEP> I love Jesse Dee's songs. I recommend this song and many more on ""On my mind/in my heart"".  Soulful and entertaining performer."
Five Stars <SEP> I just rrealy like some of the old bues music they did back in the day!
"A few covers keep this from being 5 stars <SEP> When I think of ""True"" American country I think of the original artists singing some good songs and they have that here for the most part: 'I Walk the Line' by Johnny Cash, 'Six Days on the Road' by Dave Dudley, and even Sleepy LaBeef's original version of 'Me and Bobby Mcgee' (which, I suppose, is the reason they have a picture of Kris Kristofferson on the cover though no songs from him other than that that he wrote). But then they have Deana Carter singing 'On the Road Again' and while she has a good voice I don't want covers! I want Willie Nelson singing 'On the Road Again' and if you can't get the rights to it choose another song. And they have a song by Don Williams but not 'I Believe In Love' but a cover of James Taylors' 'You've Got a Friend', and the Carter Family singing 'Ring of Fire' which I believe they sang first but still, come on people we want to hear Johnny and June on that record. Anyways, the good-great tracks on this album way outnumber the not-so-great covers and its definitely worth the price. Also never heard Roy Drusky's 'White Lightening Express' before and was very pleasantly surprised (mainly cause I know him as a gospel singer) and hope that people start writing songs like that again."
Excellent solo piano work <SEP> This is a pretty terrific solo piano arrangement of some of the works of Bill Frisell.  Its a worthwhile buy and addition to your listening rotation.
"Utter Relaxation <SEP> When listening to the Indio Acarya's music, it reminds one of pure and simple relaxation of the best kind.  Imagine coming home from a hard day of non-stop traffic and yelling, showered by distractions.  All you have to do is run yourself a hot bath, and let the music transport you to an oasis of healing.  One is left with a feeling of transport to an exotic island once you close your eyes.  Vibrant scents fill the air and the body is enveloped in warmth, almost as if you are up in the heavens resting on a pillow.  Now if that is not pure relaxation, then I don't know what is."
"Not the best Lucksmiths tunes penned <SEP> Not the best Lucksmiths tunes penned, but solid and the last two recorded as the band, so a must have for fans."
Lee Oskar is awesome; <SEP> This cut with the bagpipe intro is another example of creative fusion prowess of Oskar!
Simple Delight <SEP> This is a delightful version of Silent worship.  Mark Stone has a rich mellow voice and is accompanied by the piano.  This version is mellow and evocative of an evening spent by the fireside in a candlelight room listening to music.
... something new to the table and this album is perfect alternative and progressive rock <SEP> i came to know this band through psycho pass and i gotta say that this band brings something new to the table and this album is perfect alternative and progressive rock.....nuff said
Five Stars <SEP> Enjoy this meditation !
"Unofficial reproductions <SEP> Buyer beware!  Genuine Japanese Polydor ENO LPs went out-of-print over 30 years ago! They completely disappeared from record store shelves by ~1985 and have been extremely scarce ever since.  I know this because I used to import them direct from Japan circa 1980-1982.  These ""new"", ""sealed"", ""reissued""  copies are just that... copies (aka counterfeits), not even made in Japan!  Although they're done really well there are many details that easily verify this:  Japan obi text is nonsense in places, colors on jackets and obis is somewhat off, labels and Matrix #'s are WAY off, inner sleeves (MoFi?) and inserts are wrong, and most obvious Polydor Japan hasn't pressed vinyl in years... decades, and if they did they wouldn't even own the Publishing and Copyrights to ENO's music (which expired back in the 1980's).  Also, where genuine pressings (circa 1980) are mastered from the original tapes, these fakes are merely copies of the CD remasters, likely the DSD versions that came out a few years ago...  translation:  you're not getting a true pure analog (AAA) version, but rather something that's been messed with digitally then pressed back to vinyl (= vinyl copy of a CD).
Could go on and on, but I'll save you...  Just know that what you're getting is an unofficial/unlicensed/modern reproduction of a classic Japanese issue from ~35 years ago... not the real thing, and should be advertised and sold as such."
Codi Jordan is going through phases! <SEP> I'm generally one who likes the reggae/ska genres and that's when I started to listen to codi Jordan but through their last three Cd's it has gone from reggae/ska/alternative to rock/reggae/ alternative to rock/reggae/ country this album sounds terrible and very repetitive! I am quite disappointed
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"Spanish Songs Styled in Jazz <SEP> ****1/2. This second album by Alex Conde is now Bay Area based but carries on his flamenco jazz styling with more classical and popular cante jondo, as the listener may find with two tracks of familiar melodies. Conde is a very fine pianist and composer, classical trained in Spain; he further developed his jazz skills at the Berklee College in Massachusetts. For his recording sessions, he has many musicians to support him [see below for listing]. While I found his earlier Jazz & Claps album superior in freshness and fusion, this opus is still very worthy for explorations of Latin jazz. It is more popular Spanish than flamenco-inspired and orchestral in details, with the inclusion of strings. Barrio del Carmen, track 2, is located in Valencia, Spain, Conde's home town. The same can be said for Plaza de la Virgen, honored in the following track. Andaluzia (track 4) is derived from Spanish Dance No. 5, composed by Enrique Granadas [1867-1916]. In the taranta of track 6, Conde slows down for a contemplative improvisation. Callejon del Silencio refers to a street in the southern Spanish coastal town of Almu&ntilde;&eacute;car, near M&aacute;laga. El Puerto is from a classical dance melody of Manuel de Falla [1876-1946] from La Vida Breve. 52 minutes.

"Nashville's First R&R Band <SEP> The name ""Garry Miles"" may forever be associated with that ignominious club known as the One-Hit Wonder, that being his cover of Look For A Star (from the film Circus Of Horrors) - a # 16 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in July 1960 on Liberty 55261 b/w Afraid Of Love. For a while that created a bit of confusion since a British artist going under the name Garry Mills had the same song out for Imperial at the same time (his went to # 26) - and both ultimately became One-Hit Wonders.

But James ""Buzz"" Cason, the birth name of this Garry Miles (November 27, 1939 in Nashville) is no stranger to a hit record. At the age of 17 in 1956 he became the vocalist for what is now commonly considered to be Nashville's first true R&R band called The Casuals (with guitarist Johnny McCreery, pianist and fellow vocalist Richard Williams, saxophonist Joe Watkins, accordionist/pianist Chester Powers, and drummer Billy Smith). They released their first single early in 1957 on the small Nashville label Nu-Sound 801 (Help Me/My Love Song For You) and when it began to elicit interest in the region it was picked up and released as Dot 15557. That's the 45 rpm covered here. A bit later that year, they had Hello Love/Till You Come Back To Me issued as Dot 15671, and while neither record made the national charts their skills did not go unnoticed as, by 1959, they had become The Casual Teens and the backing band for Decca recording star Brenda Lee (guitarist Wayne Moss had taken over from McCreery, Powers had departed and double-neck bassist Snuffy Smith added).

In 1960 he and Williams signed with Liberty Records as two-thirds of a trio called The Statues (along with former Jordanaires bass vocalist Hugh Jarrett) and in August had a # 84 Hot 100 cover of the 1951 Tony Bennett hit Blue Velvet on Liberty 55245 b/w Keep The Hall Light Burning. This came a few months after his hit with Look For A Star as Garry Miles which actually carried a later label number. And while he would never register another national charter under any of his stage names (see list in Comments below), he would be part of many as a backing vocalist for a wide array of stars such as Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Kenny Rogers, Jimmy Buffett, Kris Kristofferson, Conway Twitty, Waylon Jennings and George Jones - just to name a few.

He is also renowned as a songwriter with countless of the tunes he has written (or had a hand in writing with people like Bobby Russell) appearing on albums by an equally-wide array of artists too numerous to mention, as well as some that became smash hits, with particular emphasis on Country although he crossed all genres, such as: Sandy, a # 27 Hot 100 in late 1964/early 1965 for Ronny & The Daytonas; Everlasting Love, a # 13 Hot 100/# 14 R&B in 1967 for Robert Knight and again in 1974 for Carl Carlton (# 6 Hot 100/# 11 R&B);  Another Woman, a # 14 Country in 1975 for T.G. Sheppard; Ann (Don't Go Runnin'), a # 2 Country in1972 for Tommy Overstreet; and A Million Old Goodbyes, a # 8 Country for Mel Tillis in 1981. There are many more.

His love of Country is reflected in the 1977 LP DJM DJLPA-8 ""Buzz"" and, sometime in the mid-1980s, he formed a Rockabilly group called B.C. & The Dartz (see Rhythm Bound On An American Saturday Night), and later cut the CDs Hats Off To Hank and Busload Of Love (all available at Amazon).

I just wish someone would cull together some of the other earlier releases shown in the Comments in a re-mastered CD. If all you want is a good, quality copy of Look For A Star on CD I would recommend either Volume 2 of Ace of London's Teenage Crush, or Volume 7 of Eric Records' Hard To Find 45s On CD:  More 60's Classics. I have yet to run across a copy of Blue Velvet on CD."
Five Stars <SEP> Not the best i've heard.
not bad!! <SEP> Got a Lil bit of everything but still some classic Jon b. Solid album in my personal opinion if ur a fan get it!
Four Stars <SEP> good cd
Yea Cassadee <SEP> I loved watching her on the voice and I can't wait to have her release her first album. Love this song
"I like it <SEP> Cassadee is very good, I especially liked Tom , Stand & Stupid Boy, I look forward to listening to more"
"The aural equivalent of a screensaver <SEP> As a showcase for Petre Inspirescu's sound, this is a decent collection of tracks. He is one of the few producers adhering to the minimal genre that is daring to dream big ideas. Think classical music influences, obscure and eerie samples and subtle changes of tempo and dynamics. Quite often he makes very long tracks that slowly develop over time.

I suppose the bigger question is, do we really need a showcase for Petre Inspirescu at this stage in his career? He has only really emerged as a major artist in the last couple of years. Some may see him as a potential heir to Villalobos and I suppose that is why he took up the opportunity to put out a full-length Fabric mix of all his own tracks, just like Villalobos did. Seems like a solid PR move from his standpoint.

While the Villalobos Fabric mix was a train wreck of bombastic, clashing ideas and WTF?! type moments, befitting of a producer bursting with creativity who felt (along with many of his fans) that he could try and do almost anything, from experimental kabuki to Latin American stompers, the Inspirescu edition is a much more polite affair. In fact, as a mix, it's a bit of a bore. There are some pretty tracks, some subtle tempo changes and some weird sounds you may not hear elsewhere. I think he also does a good job of letting some of his tracks play together. But the mix never really picks up much momentum. The shifts in mood feel like the difference between fourth and third gear, never even approaching first. There is so much time when you are only really hearing the minimal percussion. The end goes out with a long lull, like he is literally trying to put you to sleep.

If Villalobos is Picasso, Inspirescu is like Monet. Unfortunately fabric 68 feels more like a Monet screensaver, lacking emotion and merit of the artist's best work."
A Master Plan <SEP> A Classic jazz piece sung here by one of the best. There are beautiful rhythmic instrumentation along with some beautiful flute melodies.

Four Stars <SEP> Good Song
Greatest Band Ever <SEP> Every song on their albums are chart toppers in my opinion.  Everything they have done is incredible.  They are a musical genre unto themselves.
"Grasser <SEP> Loved this song from the moment it hit my ears.  Sadly I missed the Steeldrivers at the Station Inn here in Nashville, but this is hands down my favorite song by them."
"HOLY GROUND IS WHEREVER I WILLFULLY STEP, NOT UNDER DURESS <SEP> Holy moley, pope benedict quit his post, unacceptable. At least the last pope has the opportunity to do the right thing, by relinquishing the keys to the vatican to me."
Five Stars <SEP> Great music.
one of the best albums <SEP> great song; great song writing
"Two Stars <SEP> just ok, gets old"
Four Stars <SEP> Great EDM song!
DAMN STRAIGHT <SEP> SHAKING IT OFF TO A NICE BEAT.
"Disappointed <SEP> I purchased this believing it was the full version of the song, but it's just the music with no vocals.  Very disappointed."

"One Star <SEP> Not worth it, even for SRV fans"
"curious and amazing. The CD is on backorder both on the ... <SEP> I wonder why the sound pierces my core from the first notes....could it be 432hz instead of 440? Just listen to the sample and see if it effects you instantly. There's a very slight pause on some notes that seems to draw one into that pause the way one might when listening to a person speaking with slight breaks, (remember how John Wayne's speech pattern was arresting in it's breaking manner?)...curious and amazing. Wish Mark O'Connor could have a go at the violinist part. The CD is on backorder both on the artist's website as well as Amazon but as quick as it's available I MUST have the full album so my entire family can enjoy it.  God's hand is surely on you, Joshua."
Disrespectful remix <SEP> Half done. Lazy remix with no imagination. Boring. I love Chaka but I HATE this remix. Disrespectful to the artistry.
"Once bitten, Twice shy. <SEP> I was really looking forward to this disc, as I'm sure most Whitesnake historians were too. Well, what we have here is a disc that sounds like generic 80s piddle, a 'heavied up' Brian Adams (which is the last thing anyone needs.) No good riffs, no good songs and very few tasty guitar solos. Odd considering there is no market for this type of pablum. This band had nothing to lose by putting out a blues rock barnburner, but they released an embarassing 80s-style form of music that no self respecting fan of the old band (you know who!) would even remotely embrace. And I've listened to this a lot. It just ain't what you think it is. Buyer beware."
"Unmissable <SEP> Having observed Harry Worcester's career for a quarter of a century since his humble beginnings as a struggling singer in the short-lived London-based band The Business Connection, it is a great pleasure to hear him perform on such a beautifully-crafted album as this.

People have tried to describe The Listening Device as what would occur if Tom Waits became the lead singer of Coldplay. Jools Holland (the former Squeeze keyboard player and long-serving British TV presenter) pronounced them as fitting ""somewhere between Ray Charles and Nick Cave.""

But I urge you to discover the truth for yourself by downloading this amazing album full of political insight, heartbreaking melodies and extraordinary performances."
"Tara's first single! <SEP> As one of Tara Strong's first official single-track releases, I think this is a great example of her singing voice. She should sing more!"
Undoubtedly Best Zueignung ever ! <SEP> Best version of this song I have ever heard.
"Gorgeous and Engrossing <SEP> Amazing musician, a gorgeous blend of Florence and the Machine, Feist, and slices of her own soul. A true album in the album sense, you will listen to it over and over again and wonder how you ever lived life without it. Seriously."
This item is mis-labeled. The name of this band ... <SEP> This item is mis-labeled. The name of this band is 1975 and they should not be confused with the band from Manchester called The 1975.
First movement only. Who would want to listen to a truncated thing? <SEP> You got to be kidding. Compared to the other digital bargains on amazon thiis is a waste of tme. The end.
Talib Kweli can do better than this... <SEP> I don't believe the song lives up to the title. The beat is annoying and it sounds like Talib Kweli just threw this one together. I still respect him as an MC.
"boring pop at it's finest <SEP> This CD seemingly makes a great coaster for my morning tea.  The problem is, I don't drink tea.  This is a 'been there-done that' CD that leaves nothing to the imagination.  Straight-ahead, boring pop with no real  surprises.  If you're into 10,000 Maniacs minus originiality then you'll  love this disk.  If you're looking for something with a little more spice,  then keep on searching."
"If you're looking for Matt Healy, you won't find ... <SEP> If you're looking for Matt Healy, you won't find him here. Nor will you find Atlas Genius. This record is a lawsuit looking for a place to happen. Perhaps they could pick up a dictionary on the way to the barrister's office. Avoid."
Want more <SEP> Luv  his baritone  voice

"Mr. Entertainment ! <SEP> It was great  !  , I remember back in the day when my mom would take me 2 see Jackie Wilson at the Apollo or the RKO Albee, those were great days, and Jackie was 1 of my mother's favorite performers"
"Good recording quality <SEP> First rate! Good recording quality, but remember, stereo wasn't available until 1957 and wasn't widely available until 1958. But there are some very good songs on here.

FYI, Jackie Wilson was Barry Gordy's (founder of Hitsville, then Motown) first hit recording artist. Jackie's first hit was Reet Petite. Go have a listen to it on YouTube, then buy this CD! It's very good with little to complain about. Not stellar, but very good material here!"
One Star <SEP> It was not the right song!
"Delightful <SEP> I heard a cut from this album on my local college radio station (Album 88 from Georgia State University, for the curious) and had to look it up when I got home. I downloaded it right away, and it's a brilliant collection. Nice and upbeat with really warm mixes. Definitely recommend."
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite songs from Manowar's early days.

Love it! <SEP> First kid Rock song I ever heard and I had to buy the album. Might have done some of those things in the song.
"Censored version. Don't buy! <SEP> I ended up replacing my old Kid Rock CD because of this. I used to own the CD version of ""Devil Without A Cause"". Time passes, things get lost or broken... So I decided to buy the MP3s of my fav songs from the album. Well, these MP3s are CENSORED.

It's best to raid the little mom & pop stores on Amazon for the CD version, rip it, and enjoy Kid Rock's best on your MP3 player or smartphone."
Four Stars <SEP> Some of the best musical junk food out there
"Four Stars <SEP> I love the song, but was VERY disappointed to find out that the song I purchased was CENSORED."
"Not as advertised. <SEP> I was disappointed.  My Sweetheart is from Michigan and a huge Kid Rock fan.  The version of ""Cowboy"" I bought said ""explicit"" but had ""radio edit"" right in the middle of it.  I put it on her Playlist, but both of us went ""WHAT?"" as the song played.
Don't buy this for a devout Kid Rock fan."
"Kid Rock ROCKS! <SEP> I like the flow of the song.  I like the lyrics even though I do not normally care for explicit songs.  And let me tell you, it is EXPLICIT.  I have recommended this song to my friends that like rockin' rap."
Love it! <SEP> Classic Kid Rock! Love it!
Five Stars <SEP> GREAT

Five Stars <SEP> lets rock
"Where you at Rock, Where you at? <SEP> This isn't a ""clean"" version of the origional. Is it even Kid Rock? I don't mind the edited versions as I can play some song around the kids without feeling guilty. Too bad this isn't what it says it is. Rock where you at...?"
"Avoid <SEP> Not even the true ""Clean"" version.  I don't know who made this, but Bawitdaba is terrible.  I was specifically seeking the ""Clean"" version, and this is NOT it.  Time to dig through my CD's to find it."
"Censorship ruined this album. <SEP> The censorship and editing out of all the bad words is done in such a poor manner on this album it completely ruins the song.  I would have rather listened to blank space than the sound effects in this.  ""Radio edit"" is actually spoken aloud in place of one of the words. Bad, bad bad."
"Clean version <SEP> I was a bit thrown off when the album kicked off mid-syllable.  I figure, ""ok, this is just the album version of 'Bawitdaba.'""  Then the censorship started.  If I had known this was the clean version, I would have skipped it entirely.

HOWEVER.  Now that I listen to it most of the way through, and I've gotten past the odd version of ""Bawitdaba,"" it's actually not TERRIBLE.  This album is from back when Kid Rock was a rap-rock artist, and dude could flow.  Kids use those words still, right?  Anyways, I'm going to deal with it until I find an uncensored version at a thrift store for cheaper."
"Devil w/o a cause <SEP> Kid Rock is an amazing singer & song writer & live he's the best show. However this album IS NOT the original! It's edited to no end.... I saw no dis-claimed syaing that.... Had it been original & un-edited I'd give it a 9 on a scale of 1 - 5.

 Not Kid Rocks fault I'm giving this a 1.5 because I gotta buy the ORIGINAL."
"CENsORED <SEP> If you like the clean version this is for you, If you don't then don't buy this. I wish i would have read the one reveiw before i bought this. I give it 4 stars because it should say that it is censored and it doesnt."
"IT'S CENSORED <SEP> It should say right in the title this is a censored version, but it doesn't. For anyone familiar with this album, a censored version is a neutered version. There was an explicit version before, but now it's gone. I bought this by mistake and now I want to kill myself."

I love it <SEP> Can't go wrong with these guys.  Real pro musicianship and finally crafted tunes are their secrets to success.  Great record!

"Fox.... <SEP> Really, stealing from JoCo and then not even admitting it?  Please do not buy this and support the artists that originally did this song"
Awful <SEP> This is a terrible rip-off. An artist took great care into crafting a clever cover and the Glee producers did not care to credit him.
"Your lawyer would approve, but your mother wouldn't. <SEP> This is an arrangement stolen from Jonathan Coulton.
Don't buy this.  Buy his.
Glee steals arrangements from lots of artists.  Might be legal, but certainly isn't ethical.

""Your lawyer would approve, but your mother wouldn't."""
"Good cover credited incorrectly <SEP> They performed it fine, but it would have been nice to credit the person who arranged this version. They shamelessly stole from Jonathan Coulton. Makes you wonder what other songs they have plagiarized."
"Off the mark <SEP> This ""cover of a cover"" totally misses the point.  Leave aside the fact that it is stealing, the context in which this song is placed really misses the mark on the original intention of this gorgeously written and composed cover.  Maybe if they'd taken the time to compose their own cover, they might be able to buy a clue.  Don't support an industry that only protects the copyright of the person with the most money.  There are plenty of other reasons not to watch Fox."
"Crap move Glee, <SEP> Ripping off Jonathan Coulton was a lazy crappy move. To profit off of his work, not offer any acknowledgement, really shows how low your team has come to scraping the barrel? Cant you hire your own song writers, or are they too busy browsing facebook and youtube to get any real work done for you?
I am extremely disappointed."
"Confused <SEP> I'm confused, why is this cover version more expensive than the original Jonathan Coulton version of the song?  Typically when you see a karaoke ""in the style of"" song, it's about ten cents cheaper."
"Bad Business <SEP> What can I say? As much as I love Glee, this is an admitted (by FOX) rip-off of Jonathan Coulton's cover. Not sure why they couldn't even give him a line in the credits."
"Lovely, but Wrong <SEP> This song is a beautifully accomplished version of ""Baby Got Back."" However -  It shouldn't have been made, in my opinion. Others have called it a rip off. Perhaps. But a bunch of white kids singing it to a slow pop beat sounds wrong. It was meant to glorify a black woman's beautifully big backside. Sounds beautiful until you realize what exactly they are singing."
"Lousy performance of someone else's arrangement of someone else's song <SEP> Get the good version from Jonathan Coulton to hear this song by the arrangement's author, performed much better:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Got Back (In the Style of Glee)</a>"
"A literal theft (audio copy) from Coulton - For Shame, Fox <SEP> Fox literally took the tracks Coulton published as part of his recordings, remixed them to change the percussion and his vocals, then recorded new vocals and percussion. See the analysis at [...] They then played it without including any credit whatsoever.

When Coulton contacted them, he describes their response as ""...to basically say that they're within their legal rights to do this, and that I should be happy for the exposure (even though they do not credit me, and have not even publicly acknowledged that it's my version - so you know, it's kind of SECRET exposure). While they appear not to be legally obligated to do any of these things, they did not apologize, offer to credit me, or offer to pay me, and indicated that this was their general policy in regards to covers of covers.""

So no credit, no payment, literal theft of his recording, and they told him to stick it. If this show ever stood for anything good, they've utterly lost it.

Note also that Fox is censoring all comments about this on the Glee web site."
"Blataant thievery <SEP> Arrangement was tken directly from the uber talented Jonathan Coulton without asking or attribution.  Disgraceful.  And it's not nearly as good as his version.

"Do Your Own Work, Glee! <SEP> Maybe next time the people who produce Glee should think before they rip-off someone else's work! It's painfully obvious that this arrangement of ""Baby Got Back"" was stolen from Jonathan Coulton. Try doing your own work, Glee."
"This is not the original cover. <SEP> If you're looking here, you've found the version of this song that was stolen by Glee. The original cover is by Jonathan Coulton, and that's where you should be."
"Joco does a cover right- Glee does it wrong <SEP> Jonathan Coulton got permission to do a cover of Baby Got Back- he created an original acoustic melody to go with Sir MixaLot's fabulous words. All was right in the world.

Glee did NOT get permission nor did they give him credit. They blatantly ripped Jonathan Coulton's audio- not even changing the line ""Johnny C's in trouble"". It's wrong, it's lazy, and they're stupid. Buy the Jonathan Coulton version.

Don't support these crooks!"
"No ethics at all <SEP> This was ripped off directly from a popular independent musician named Jonathan Coulton, without credit or compensation. If you absolutely must have this song (and really, it's a great cover), do everyone a favor and purchase the re-release from Coulton, not this one, which was stolen by a mega-corporation. Not only is Coulton's original version cheaper, but he's donating the proceeds to two worthy charities.

While you're at it, check out his other work. You may find something you like."
"Disgusting Theft <SEP> This song was straight up stolen from Jonathan Coulton, even so much as using his own music in the track. Simply disgusting and indefensible. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed and with luck JoCo can get some sort of legal compensation from this theft."
"Perfect for back ground music on PP church programs, or family movies <SEP> Easy listening to favorite hymns."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
"The smooth beat with a nice kick keeps your head bobbing singing the hook - ... <SEP> Just the song to pick you up in the morning on the way to work or even on the way home. The smooth beat with a nice kick keeps your head bobbing singing the hook - ""Through the morning...through the night we can make this thing so tight""...!"
Five Stars <SEP> Another good song.
"Wait for the US release coming in July-Sept <SEP> My advice to prospective collectors: wait for the US/European release of this box. After the tremendous success of the ""Karajan 60"" box set after it was released in a European version, word of mouth has it that DG is preparing this set for release in Europe and USA with a new booklet with all recording information and also remasterings of many of these recordings. Contact the company and let them know you are interested; Sometimes they even respond to an email.
After writing the above I was informed by Universal that the European/USA version will be released in July in Europe and Sept in USA in a box with 82 CDs. Well worth the wait, I would imagine."
"Too expensive <SEP> This is too much for a collection of recordings of this age. I am a great admirer of Karajan, and would love to purchase this set if it were to be issued at a more reasonable price, comparable to the 100 or so for the two EMI Karajan sets. But not at this price!"
"Beautiful voice.  Thank you, Arizona! <SEP> Romantic slow drag"
"Love it! <SEP> Found on Pandora (searched ""Montefiori Cocktail""). This is a favorite when I'm on a plane and it's clear and sunny. Loved the little vocals, piano and even the jazzy dj-mixing. Belongs in your jazz/lounge collection."
Great song <SEP> Heard this oldie on XM a few weeks ago and ended up buying it.  Amazing to me how much more I appreciate the good songs from the '80s now.  There is so much good music from that era.  This is but one example.
50 is back <SEP> This is the 50 we want to hear not that amusement park 50 but more the grimy NY representing 50
love it <SEP> i love this song evn tho snoop lion is on it ha ha 50 cent is the best and young jeezy pretty good too
"The Healing Power of Music <SEP> I first bought this recording many years ago as a cassette and played it as I was going to sleep because I found it so restful.  When I went into the hospital for major surgery, I took my Walkman tape player and this cassette.  I played this tape shortly after I was moved from the recovery room to my own room.  During the night, as nurses came to check on me, they were concerned because I wasn't using my morphine drip.  I never did use the drip and I credit this healing music as the reason I didn't need additional medication.  I was so relaxed that my own body was able to deal with the pain and I healed quickly.  I have given away other copies to friends going in for various health procedures and still often go to sleep listening to this same recording.  Although I have always believed in the power of music, this recording confirmed that belief."
"Love Garrison Starr, hate MP3 <SEP> Garrison's last two albums are not available on CD.  If the music industry wants me to continue to buy music, they will have to put it on CD, or Bluray or some superior physical format.  No downloading for me please."
"Why is this abreviated? <SEP> The song ends way earlier then it does in the video.  The long version is a lot better, it has the girl singing more."
"Mic Righteous -SO RIGHTEOUS!!! <SEP> MAN, Gotta start off with I LOVE THIS ALBUM and anything this man spits. I fell off on rap. It has become garbage. But he totally threw me back on. What he speaks is REAL and you feel it too. Give this man a shot will ya? Won't be disappointed!!!"
Great Hit for our Marriage Retreat! <SEP> The music just makes you want to dance!  So uplifting and inspiring! it was a wonderful touch to our Marriage Retreat Mexican style reception!  I also use it now to exercise and dance too!
"MEH ..boring hard drum n bass <SEP> I was actually disappointed by this 2 song 12"". I am a huge fan of Dean Rodell/Current Value/Machine Code and this sounds like typical mindless cookie cutter hard drum n bass. Not the usual groundbreaking music that they usually put out. This is the first release by this crew that has ever let me down.  Maybe it was leftover out takes or unreleased stuff? Meh for sure."
"Four Stars <SEP> I like the regular version more, but still enjoy the remix."
Five Stars <SEP> good oldies
A great CD <SEP> I like Shannon's music.  Her voice is easy to listen to; the words are perfect.
Four Stars <SEP> I love her worship style. It is an encouraging CD.
Five Stars <SEP> good
Five Stars <SEP> ok
Five Stars <SEP> Good stuff
"Disappointed <SEP> Although this is a lovely performance by Ms Luker, it didn't contain all the lyrics heard during her NPR interview. Those were mostly what I was purchasing this for."
"Jay Chou a Wonderful Talent <SEP> This is the end song to the movie Curse of the Golden Flower ( an excellent film ). Jay Chou is a very talent actor as well as singer.
He rendition of this song is quite moving."
"Must have been tired <SEP> When i first heard the song i was feeling it, i love deep house not the Techno type house so after i downloaded it and had the chance to listen to several times, i was like Ugh!! why did i choose this crappy song.. I Must Have Been Tired!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> good product and fast delivery
"More Great Funk and Jazz Instrumentals <SEP> Much like their first collection ""Mit Peck"".  Check out their YouTube videos if you're unsure.

Like I said before, I don't know who they are, but they sure can play."
Five Stars <SEP> Just nice)))!!
Great song. <SEP> This group is very talented.  I think they have a great future.  I will love to here more from them.
Love this new trio! <SEP> Love this new trio and song!  Beautiful harmonies and lyrics!  I can't wait to see what they come out with next.
Rock On! <SEP> These guy's started the twin lead guitars. Just outstanding Music. They have started in 1968. They are still playing strong 2015. All Pro. Great experience with seller. Everything came right on time.
"Another wonderful accomplishment from October Babies! <SEP> The soulful and child-like voice of lead singer Toko is only equaled by the talents of Erik and the other members of this incredible, yet  over-looked by the mainstream, family of musicians and artists.  WELL DONE OCTOBER BABIES... WELL DONE INDEED!"
Glorious singing! <SEP> Joel Fredrickson has the most amazing bass voice and has surrounded himself with a wonderful ensemble.  A great addition to my vocal music collection.  Highly recommended.
"Real music. <SEP> Nothing really complicated here, just real music performed live by two real guys who have a passion for traditional American music, and just happen to be masters of the form.  A great mixture of songs and instrumentals, and quite possibly the best recording of ""Sittin' On Top Of The World"" that I've ever heard.  If you like traditional music, buy it."
"Kingdom Music Review <SEP> This song is truly beautiful! Ashley Brown is a personal, close friend of mine, and she is a great woman of God! I've known her for going on 4 years now, and it gives me overflowing joy to see her allowing herself to be used by God through song! This song is so peaceful, yet has a strong and passionate message! Really is a blessing to me!"
"Tangerine Dream rip off <SEP> I don't know what this had to do with ""Tangerine Dream"" but considering the group has been co opting with so many people lately I figured ""why not"". Not I think I heard Tadros mention tangerine dream in one of the cuts.  I suppose it's catchy hip hop but not what I expected. Sorry"
Terrible Version. And it says that it is featuring ... <SEP> Terrible Version. And it says that it is featuring Drake and others which is just a lie. One person is rapping and it's awful. Can I have my $.89 back please.
One Star <SEP> Not drake
root around <SEP> I know when you catch up to this one you are going to have a ball.
Not my favorite. <SEP> I love the Four Freshman;  this cut sounded more like Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Beyond beautiful <SEP> I am absolutely in love with William Beckett's voice and lyrics.  He is truly amazing.  I am so glad that he released this stripped down version of the 3 EPs that he put out last year.  It is a pleasant and surprising departure from The Academy Is.  I love that he is trying new things and his music continues to evolve and grow.  Can't wait to see what he will give us next!
Great song <SEP> This is one of the two songs that I love on this album.
One Star <SEP> It's good initially. But don't like much. It depends on choice. You may like this.
"If it were longer it would be better <SEP> In this listing it states the sound effects are 00:30 minutes. One would think it's 30 minutes. When I downloaded it, it was really 00:00:30. A big difference 30 seconds vs 30 minutes. I wanted this to play for 30 minutes while kids were trick or treating. Plus it downloaded to a temp file and everytime I try & move it to my Amazon MP3 folder it won't let me. Says it's running in Firefox but it's NOT!"
it's not actually explicit <SEP> i mean come on. it says explicit right in the title. but the eminem track is clean. how do you screw that up.
So addicting! <SEP> I heard this song as background to a  video and searched to find it.  It is so peaceful and addicting.  Love it!  Give it a  try!
Raspy Folk Goodness~ <SEP> There is something to be said for Folk Music like this. I love going cat fishing and this tune is just perfect! From the guitar to the raspy voice Otis has.
"new favorite group <SEP> Found out about this band on an NPR podcast, so looked them up online. ""Burning Days"" was my favorite but the more you listen to this band the more you can say you like all their songs, as well as the one or two that really seem to catch your attention, right now I would say ""Feel the Fall"" is my ""favorite"" but ""If Only For a Day"" is really catching my attention. I currently looking at YouTube videos of live performances and now can't wait to see them live and purchase more songs."
"THIS IS NOT SUSAN HAYWARD !!! <SEP> This is not Susan Hayward. It's Jane Froman from the 1952 film, 'With A Song In My Heart' in which Susan Hayward played Jane Froman. The songs were all sung by Jane Froman and dubbed for Susan Hayward. Check IMDB and you'll see."
An exceptional album and one of my all time favorites ... <SEP> An exceptional album and one of my all time favorites. I always listen to it when I'm traveling long distances and it seems to put me in a positive frame of mind.
There is no 's' at the end of 'Winter' morons! <SEP> Whoever bootlegged this album didn't even know the man's name. There is no 's' at the end of 'Winter' morons!
"Big difference from original artists <SEP> While Amazon didn't let me listen to every song, the ones that I did listen to were peppy pop with decent vocalists and music.  However, I listen to the real thing and there is a big difference.

This isn't like the Now CDs that have a compilation of original artists of the year. These are cover bands."
"Don't even bother. Not real artists. Go to iTunes. <SEP> Why would I purchase COVER SONGS when I can purchase the songs sung by the real artists??

AMAZON... get with the K-pop wave already! PLEASE!!
I hate everything apple, but iTunes has got a good selection of all the current k-pop music."
It is not what it seems! <SEP> It is not what it seems! Would not buy this again!
"Not Original <SEP> None of the songs are done by the original artists.  The vocalists are pretty good, whomever they are, but having listened to the majority of the songs done by the original artists it's quite a let down.  I would be doubtful if any of the royalties from this purchase make it back to the original artists as well.  If that isn't the case and can be substantiated I'd be willing to give this more starts."
"Headphone Commute Review <SEP> Agnete's Laughter is a six-movement composition employing computer-processed sounds and vocals by Birgitte Alsted, a Danish electro-acoustic composer and graduate of the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. The pieces offer a glimpse into a hallucinogenic and at times even nightmare laden dream-world of experimental music laced with dripping water and schizophrenic voices. Alas, the darkness of these sounds and words are not so negative per se - the ability to capture the voices of another dimension and weave them into a sonic quilt is almost supernatural in effort. This sound collage is inspired by literature and poetry, drawing roots for this specific piece from Danish ballad, ""Agnete and the Merman"", in which Agnete leaves behind her husband and children and dies of a broken heart. An underwater sculpture by Suste Bonnn at the bottom of Frederiksholm Canal is another interpretation of the poem, to which Alsted plays a tribute with the sounds of water. The compact disc release collects three other works by Alsted: Melencolia, Sorgsang V and Belletter."
One Star <SEP> What in the world is this mess?
"bad covers <SEP> I wish I had seen the reviews in the music app. All covers, all poorly done."
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY <SEP> wtf is this... THESE SONGS ARE JUST COVERS AND ARE SUNG BY FOREIGNERS!!! WHAT A LETDOWN... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY YALL
"Just covers <SEP> Not actual songs, just covers. I'm glad I listened to the prime ones before buying any."
"Don't bother <SEP> Just covers, not worth the time to download it"
Not authentic! <SEP> You can tell from the previews that these are not the original artists!
Listen to the Preview! <SEP> They're not sung by the original artists. What's even worse is that most of them sound like foreigners trying to sing in Korean as if they just learned how to speak Korean.
"Worst buy ever <SEP> I generally love all kpop music. I was truthfully angry after purchasing this.
Why you might ask?
Because every single song is a fake!
Each and every song on here was made by some random group of people. I'm not saying they sound terrible, but I can 100% tell.
The reason I bring this down to 1 star is just I was soo expecting all real songs and it was such a let down.
Sadly I will still listen to this but knowing they are all fakes will disgust me. What can I do?"
Five Stars <SEP> This is a great rendition of this song.
"Change we must to live again... <SEP> I discovered Josh Kramer's music last year by pure serendipitous circumstances. Since then, his beautiful music has made me company in many life situations, providing inspiration for both life and my own musical endeavors. His previous mini-album, Afterglow, was easily my favorite, full of emotion and gentleness, but that work has now got a worthy and an even far superior successor. In addition to being a great musician, Josh is a genuine human being who communicates with his fans a lot on Facebook and whose 2012 was a very turbulent year. All the trouble, joy and sorrow now reflect in his latest album exactly like the trees reflect on water on its cover. Along with the artist, you will experience love, loss, regret, acceptance, you will cry and smile and re-learn how to love. I have been also going through many changes in recent life and in many ways I can relate very well to Josh's emotions. Human mind works in a very strange way and fears every change, but I believe one of our goals in life is to learn to embrace change and learn how to be born and reborn all the time. This, I believe, is the message of Josh's new album, a message which is reflected in its every single song in a way no words, no book, can describe as profoundly as music of a talented and genuine composer. I am not afraid to admit - I wept several times during my first play of the album, it hit me so strongly. Do yourself a favor, buy this album, support this extraordinary composer and live the emotional story of his life. This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word."
"Fascinating album <SEP> Wonderful album. She has a great, alternative and completely unique voice and sound. I can't stop listening to the album. All the songs have some type of message that encompasses the state of humanity or interpersonal issues. Great album and definetly recommend if you like different and unique music."
"Wonderfujl through 4 generations. <SEP> My father bought this LP for me when my children were babies and we all grew up on it. And now at age 55 I am comforted by the simple prayers and songs on this album. Even though I still have that original vinyl album (as well as the sleeve) I purchased the mp3 version for my own grandchildren.

The entire album is approximately 25 minutes in length and features a wonderful story of Papa John who is a gardener in God's garden. And with the help of all the animals and insects in the garden he teaches important lessons in God's love to some visiting children.
These lessons are taught through song and narration by all the lively characters in the garden. I cant write enough about how wonderful it is, even as an adult when these simple songs come to mind.
To hear ""Heavenly Father, loving Lord. As I come to pray. Help me to be true to you each day..."" warms my heart and gives me a renewed sense of comfort knowing that His Holy Spirit dwells within me.
My father is gone but I am passing this on to my grandchildren with great hope and joy. Bless the children who recorded this and all who worked to produce this gift."
Great songs that kids love to sing <SEP> My 3 year old son LOVES this CD.  He sings along on practically every song.  Great Bible based truth put to music.
"The Mummer's Dance <SEP> This download is not what I was expecting. The overall quality is not very good - it's thin and sounds ""tinny"". Loreena McKennitt's version is much, much better!"
THE ALBUM SOUTHERN SOUL LADY <SEP> A GREAT ALBUM FOR SOUTHERN SOUL BLUES MUSIC LOVERS. THE SONGS HAS A GREAT BEAT THAT IS GREAT FOR DANCING. THIS WAS A GREAT BUY FOR ME.
the best <SEP> this is a great song that I wanted for my Kindle music.  Now I have it and I watch it often.  I think we should be able to write what we want without it not being accepted because it is too short.  Not much else can be said
"whoops <SEP> Um, Howard Stern recommending this single and it is ""unavailable""??"
Newsflash!!! <SEP> Ron Burgundy calls Shenanigans!  Rick took this quite literally and created quite the mess down at the station.  If Ron Burgundy says it... it's the truth!
One Star <SEP> Most boring musician who ever lived.......
One Star <SEP> Not good noise
"""BEYOND TRHE COUDS"" REMASTER. WHAT HAPPEND!! <SEP> THIS PARTICULAR SONG HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE FOR YEARS! SO MANY WONDERFUL
CHILDHOOD MEMORIES THAT GO WITH THIS SONG. WHEN I SAW THAT THERE WAS A ""REMASTERED""
COPY ON AMAZON, I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK! I DOWNLOADED IT AND MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN,
THE SOUND QUALITY IS DREADFUL! MY COPY THAT I RECORDED FROM VINYL TO MP3 MAKES THIS
COPY SOUND LIKE QUAD! I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. SORRY AMAZON. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST
THIS DOWNLOAD TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW THE SONG IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND, AND KNOWS
QUALITY SOUND. : ("
"One Star <SEP> This person is not famous, will never be famous."
"not a great song <SEP> i thought i would like this songh cause it has one of my favorite words, Bougie in it.  but it is not that good of a song."
"Commendable CD for Patsy's legacy <SEP> This disc was quite a surprise to my ears.  Patsy's voice sounds clear as a bell due to incredible remastering, and the backing music is done tastefully, professionally, and in keeping with the mood of each song.  It truly compliments her phenomenal voice.  Great lineup of songs and the batch of live recordings at the end of the disc is a fantastic sounding treat!"
"Read it fully to get a better understanding. http <SEP> There is a thread on the Steve Hoffman Music forums about this CD. It discusses various aspects of the project including possible sources. Read it fully to get a better understanding.

[...]"
"Patsy Clines music was perfect the way she and Owen Bradley envisioned it <SEP> Bought the cd and listened to it. Regretted it immediately. Patsy Clines music was perfect the way she and Owen Bradley envisioned it. To take away or add is a mistake. No one loved her music as much as Owen Bradley and the changes he made in 1980 for the Always album were fine as that's the way he would've done it had she been there with him. This cd, in my opinion, was done purely for profit.  I do however like the cover shot."
"Wonderful story of God's love and restoration power <SEP> I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW ALEX DAVIS' CD OF THE BOOK. I DOWNLOADED THE EBOOK AT AMAZON, BUT I REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO IT ON CD. THE STORY IS VERY EMOTIONAL AND SAD. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE A CHILD, BUT THREE OF THEM!!!  ALEX DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW HE WENT TO GOD AND GOD HEALED HIS BROKEN HEART, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AUDIO VERSION. THE BOOK IS GREAT, BUT THE GUY THAT DID THE AUDIO VERSION DID AND AWESOME JOB."
"Great stuff for Rival School fans <SEP> The difficulty with an album like this -- one that's filled with ""lost"" tracks, as it were -- is that it's basically for people who are already big fans of the band.  That's a problem because most of those people already HAVE these tracks.  When the band broke up after United by Fate, these tracks were all over the internet, and since there was (at the time) no hope of seeing them properly released, people gobbled them up.

For those who wish to support the band, at least we now have the chance, even if there's nothing here that we haven't heard before.

Another problem with an album like this is that it collects ""lost"" tracks, but it doesn't collect everything.  I've never understood why labels do that.  Maybe the band didn't like the half dozen or so other songs that have yet to be released.

Anyway, here's a break down for you, of the lost tracks (two of which are earlier versions of songs from Pedals):

1. Dreamlife Avenger

An excellent opener.  You can kind of hear United by Fate sound kind of moving towards the Pedals sound, that kind of angular guitar riff/rhythm with some wah-wah experimentation.

2. Reaching Out

Nice duel guitar bits on this song, building into a fairly large chorus.  I have to guess that people everywhere are talking about the verse and mentioning Fugazi.  Not as good as the first track, but still classic Rival Schools.

3. Indisposable Heroes

This one's great.  Awesome opening riff that comes back as a bridge?  It's not really the chorus.  I'm not sure if there's a traditional chorus in this song, actually.  Another one that feels like the link between the two albums.

4. Paranoid Detectives

Oh, right, there are actually 3 on here that are on Pedals, assuming you got the deluxe edition.  This is a great song, really catchy, kind of sadly upbeat, makes you want to go for a drive.

5. On the Fray

Kind of a middle of the road rocker, with a Quicksand-esque chorus and middle section.  Nothing wrong with that.

6. The Soft Skin

Also a kind of middle of the road rocker, also with a Quicksand-esque middle.  Freezing Process!  The middle section sounds like the end of Freezing Process from Slip.

7. Tell It All to Me

Probably the darkest song on the album, which isn't a bad thing.

8. Missing Glider

The least interesting song on the album, IMO.

9. Big Waves

Yep, here's an earlier version of a song on Pedals.  The kicker: it's better!  Well, I think so, anyway.  The latter version is over produced compared to this one.  Here, we get an emphasis on guitars, with no piano and effects to dull it.

10. Sofia Loren

And on the opposite end of the spectrum is this earlier version of Shot After Shot.  The version on the record is much, much better, almost entirely because of the chorus.  This version loses all momentum when it gets to the chorus, unlike the one on the album which is just pure rock from start to finish.

11. Why Can't I Touch It

Time to groove things up a bit.  This kind of reminds me of Solea for some reason, if anyone knows them.  It's just got a nice groove.

There you go -- an album worth your time if you're a Rival Schools fan.  If you're not, I'd start with United by Fate, because it rules."
"Beware <SEP> Food was not bad but my experience was ruined by the actions of the waiter. He kept money that didn't belong to him and lied about it. He also sent my friend on a wild goose chase to speak with the manager. When the manager was notified of the money issue, he did not resolve it to her satisfaction. Instead, he said it can't be proven that the waiter took the money and basically dismissed the matter all together. Beware of dishonest waiter named Alex."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Skyepoint - Likes Of You (Independent)
Australian quartet Skyepoint, Liv Gritten (lead vocals), Tim Hickey (guitar), Tom Bofinger (drums, vocals) and Joel Speechly (bass), are making all the right noises - literally. They mix up a contemporary rock style with infectious alt. pop hooks, and the result is a four-track debut that impresses throughout its 15 minute duration, and sticks around the subconscious long after the pretend needle has left the imaginary platter.

Gritten's voice, always mixed good and high, and with a hint of All About Eve's Julianne Regan, provides a powerful vehicle for the songs, and the musicians in the band are all fine players, without ever sounding showy or overly slick. Guitarist Hickey pulls a number of intense solos out of his bag of tricks, and the rhythm section provides considerably more swing than you'd expect. Remember, this is a debut release from a relatively new band.

They begin with ""Take the Fall"", which builds pace and unadulterated oomph at a significant rate. The title track belongs on daytime radio and includes some wonderful work from Hickey, and final track ""Avalanche"" ends proceedings on a muscular high. Probably best to play it again."
Four Stars <SEP> good song
"Quickly gets annoying <SEP> The song is catchy, they all have great voices, but they repeat the chorus too much. It feels like a 10 minute song because they just drag on the same stuff."
Wings <SEP> Good for dance type music
"I was thinking that I was buying ""Que Vale Mas"" ... <SEP> I was thinking that I was buying ""Que Vale Mas"" on MP3... but the song that was actually downloaded was ""Caraqueita""... It is very disappointing..."
"Worth Purchasing <SEP> Sweet Action is a music travelogue of sorts, an EP that sketches a landscape deeply rooted in the Bible Belt-meets-Midwestern-heartland section of Broken Arrow, OK in which Jennings resides.  It also portrays a career that has taken Beau on journeys across America, those very journeys that have shaped his career as a performer and songwriter.  This EP represents more of an alt-rock and Americana showcase that is akin in spirit to works by Uncle Tupelo and early Wilco.

The thing that's really cool is that Jennings' backing band, The Tigers, is really an ensemble cast of interchangeable parts with the constants being Beau, guitarist Jarod Evans and Chad Copelin on keys. That puts an interesting spin on this project that makes it slightly more effusive than a solo project and something slightly less than a singularly traditional group effort.

Sweet Action offers five really good songs in the tradition of some of the best alt-country and roots-based rock releases of recent memory.  It's a quick listen, and a repeat player.  Definitely worth adding to your collection and well worth giving up twenty minutes of your undivided attention. --- Michael Canter - Jivewired"
"HCjr. Smokey Mary <SEP> LOVED him since I saw him on Phil Donahue so that tells you how long! 22 years. Have followed his career since he was 25 and he is 46 now! wow, can't hardly believe it. I was there for the inaugural ride of Orpheus, formal ball and all. Have some great pics of him and his dad in their blinged out 'gladiator' gear.
anyway the CD isn't supposed to have 'slow' songs but I wouldn't call all of them uptempo. Abso fave is cuddina done it followed closely by nola girl."
"An Outstanding Recording <SEP> Grosvenor displays skill in a wide variety of concertos with a common inspiration of the French style and American jazz.  The album is a fascinating coupling of these virtuosic pieces, along with some short solo works eloquently performed.  A delightful album."
Annoyed after first play <SEP> I heard it on the radio and bought the song. It got too annoying after hearing it once in the car. I now skip past it :(
Wrong song <SEP> I Shazammed Bad with Rianna and opted to purchase it. Although it said ft Rianna the version with Tiara was downloaded instead.
"Love this Song <SEP> I fell in love with this Song the first time I heard it, and the lyrics are on point too!"
"Disappointing...Lame....Wish I Could've Choked Myself Out.... <SEP> How disappointing.  If you liked Isaac in 2 and 3 I don't think you'll like him in this, he doesn't feel anything like himself I found this game so annoying that i just stopped playing it.  I wish they'd continued with the character from the prologue, I think they could've grew that character into a new hero for the series or end the way the prologue ended but why did they have to do that to Isaac!!  Why did they have to do this to Dead Space?!  Basically this game was dumb and I only gave in after reading negative reviews because I loved the series too much to not find out for myself.  If you love the other ones don't get this game, I think you'll just be disappointed by this lame crap they call Dead Space 3.  I only enjoyed the prologue..... What a shame...."
Five Stars <SEP> Great group
ICP <SEP> ICP has good music!
"Gorgeous <SEP> I really loved this sing-off between ""Kurt"" and ""Rachel"" on Glee and was a little disappointed they didn't offer the combo version they performed.  Chris Colfer is amazing but the interplay between his voice and hers was amazzzing.  I just looked online and found a version on YouTube with both.  Wonder if it is available somewhere else?  Still beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"
Five Stars <SEP> good song
Glee is the best <SEP> I love the way Naya Rivera sings this song!
"Awesome! <SEP> Probably one of Naya Rivera's strongest singles, along with Mine.  The show needs to showcase her powerful voice more often!"
Five Stars <SEP> another good one!
Love the new Music for SMASH <SEP> Love the new songs and sounds of this season of SMASH.  Keep up the great work - can't wait to see what else is in store for us.
I love this. It's so calming <SEP> I love this.  It's so calming.
"Unimpressive hardcore techno <SEP> The Outside Agency's third installment in the Crossbreed Definition Series is a combination of drum n bass and hardcore techno with Current Value, Switch Technique and The Outside Agency. Heavy and hard beats combined with dark synth sounds and some menacing samples. More hardcore than I prefer so I wasn't very impressed with this release."
"Confidence in brokenness <SEP> What appeals to me is the comforting sentiment of this album coupled with quality craftsmanship. The music sounds harmonious, but is headstrong enough not to drown in harmony. It exudes a mixture of confidence and brokenness and in this connection ultimately maturity, which is also reflected in the title of the album. To put it briefly: I love this album."
Some Kinda-Somethin <SEP> The Tune is Off The Charts Too Me Chris Jasper is Gifted in all Areas and I Bought it From Amazon Bet Music Best Place.
"Awesome song!!! <SEP> We played this song one night at church and I had to have it that night. It is great, upbeat and encouraging!"
My new Monday morning song <SEP> This song sets a certain atmosphere immediately. It reminds me of who I am and whose I am. It's a hit song!!!!
Annihilating Rhythms <SEP> Killer dark futuristic neuroid drum n bass. Hard and heavy militant beats combined with low end bass terror  and sick samples. Fans of the album Revolt and Riot by Current Value and Donny will really love this heavy sci fi influenced  drum n bass madness. Scary and nerve wracking music.
Five Stars <SEP> Extremely good CD. Jasper has been going strong for years.
"Extra Ordinary <SEP> This Album"" Inspired"" is Beautiful a lot of People don't know that Your Voice The lyrics and the Music all have to link together
when doing a Song and He has all 3 plus 1 The Instruments and I love it so Please Check it Out, You will Love it I know You Will."
Punishing DNB <SEP> Hard techno drum n bass from Limewax and Current Value. Heavy beats and glitchy rythms. The Limewax track Bathwater is minimal techno that ends with some nice ambient sweeping synth melodies  The Tempest remix is chaotic with heavy militant beats  and punishing rhythms. Reminds me of some of Aphex Twins more disturbing releases. Not one of my favorite releases by Current Value.
One Star <SEP> Worse all fake
"This woman is incredible she has the voice of an ... <SEP> This woman is incredible she has the voice of an angel
Just listening to her music will inspire you to worship with her. She's made 3 incredible cds"
Poor sound quality <SEP> I have a number of Frank Sinatra albums/CDS...Accidently ordered this (an IMPORT) Oops.  Quality just wasn't there.  My mistake really.  PD.
"Could not save download <SEP> could not save after downloading, love the song, but never got to keep it.  Might have to do research on how to keep."
Loved it then and would love to have it again <SEP> Owned this album when it was newly released.  Loved it then and would love to have it again.  I hope someone will make it available.
Hanging with Mr Cooper <SEP> A compilation of the best of Pat Cooper's comedy routines and comic songs.  There is an [explicit content] warning but I found nothing offensive.
"VERY GOOD <SEP> HELP.......I REALLY NEED A COPY OF THIS CD, CAN ANYBODY HELP ME WITH THIS? 410 679-3316"
Great tune! <SEP> This guy is on fire.
"The Reese Project:  EVENING IN VERMONT <SEP> The Reese Project:  EVENING IN VERMONT:  I gave high marks to these folks in issue # 104, & not without merit.  As you listen to the second track, ""Blues For Ruthie"", you'll recognize (instantly) why I think they're great jazz players... Tom Reese's flute on this one is among the best I've heard in 2011! I didn't realize it, but this is their 9th CD, so they have a strong playing tradition going for them, to be sure.  The lively ""Kitchen Girl"" demonstrates a diversity not often found in today's jazz world...  superb energy, & pianist Kirk Reese just KICKS on this one!  The highlight track for this ol' reviewer, though, was their rendition of Wayne Shorter's ""Footprints""... one of the most calming versions I've ever heard of this classic jazz piece!  I give TRP my MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, with an ""EQ"" (energy quotient) rating of 4.98.  Get more information at [...]"
"The and Only  Tshala Muana <SEP> What can I say,  Tshala Muana is one of the best from Africa and specifically Congo. My favorite song in the album is Tshibola. I wish this album ""The Very Best Of Tshala Muana"" included songs like Amina and Tshikunda.

Good album"
"This music was meant to be free <SEP> There's already a reviewer who's said what I came to say, but there's strength in numbers. The four songs in this collection were originally distributed for free at archive.org under the title ""The Public Domain EP."" They were created by self-described ""pop-music cult"" Hussalonia, and they're very good songs - but he didn't want you to pay anything for them. So don't. They're still up at archive.org."
"Do Not Buy This - Get It Free from the REAL Artist Instead <SEP> Do not purchase this. This ""album"" is a scam and an act of plagiarism.

The real artist who created these songs is Buffalo, NY-based musician/singer-songwriter Hussalonia. The real title of this collection is ""The Public Domain EP,"" and it can be downloaded for free on the website archive.org, which is likely where this scammer got it. It was first released in 2006, which is obvious from the upload date on the archive.org page. The EP was intended to be released into the public domain, and therefore would be royalty free, so that much is true...but Hussalonia never charged money for it, it has always been a free album. Whoever the ""Royalty Free Institute"" is, they've simply taken credit for someone else's work, put their own name on it (they even have the gall to list themselves as the owner of the copyright!) and tried to make money off of it. Don't buy anything from this ""Royalty Free Institute,"" chances are, if they've ripped of Hussalonia's music, all of their music is probably stolen from other, free sites. If you need royalty free music, download The Public Domain EP by Hussalonia on archive.org or try music by Kevin Macleod (incomptech.com)or Dan-O (danosongs.com). All of that music is royalty free, and better yet, it's all free to download, and the REAL artists who made that music are credited.

Worse still, this scammer has registered Hussalonia's music with Youtube's content ID system, so now one can't even use it without it being linked to them, causing links to buy the music from them placed on Youtube videos and ads that make money for them...it's a real shame that people take advantage of freely shared music like this, just to make a quick buck. Shame on them."
"Nice! <SEP> A good love song, but overall generic, which is a good thing. The lyrics relates well with many people and I'm sure many people have had an experience like this, and the beat is decent."
"Pretty song <SEP> I remember Stefano from American Idol a few years ago, he has a really great, smooth voice. I think this song is really pretty and has a great beat. :)"
yes to love <SEP> Be nice if you get the whole song when you got to buy it other than that its a good song and only one I had problems with
the better he gets <SEP> The older he gets; the better he gets.  Great song.
Five Stars <SEP> Hilarious songs.
"nah <SEP> Play it once and never listen to this again. I hate the picture too.
That about sums it up. Ok."
"Check it out! <SEP> One of my favorite electronic albums.  Very somber and moody with a minimal yet technical approach to songwriting.  If you like her in Braids, you'll love this album."
"Five Stars <SEP> If you haven't heard ""Valencia"" you should. Lots of different versions out there."
"One Star <SEP> Very basic, no talent"
Bypass This <SEP> My title says it all. Do not waste your time. Spend your money on another song. That is all I have to say.
Have no idea. <SEP> Song is just ok.  I did not know I was being charged for this.  I deleted it a week ago.  I was trying to sample some songs then it charged me for a download.  Oh well.
YUK <SEP> IT WAS FREE AND IT CAN STAY THAT WAY.  NOT THE TYPE OF MUSIC FOR ME.  LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE MODERN IN STYLE.
"When you take a free sample, you never know <SEP> ...if you're gonna like it.  A blind sample of this, and I didn't like it.  It's not my type of music."
Yuck <SEP> I am not sure what the artist was doing here but wow. a little too odd for me. I am not sure what to say except that I did not like it.
One Star <SEP> Very poor quality recording buyer beware
"Hollow Eyes, Petra <SEP> a good ol song.  It has a good beat, and a message that can get to your heart.  Beat The System a must have album."
sexy <SEP> too sexy to be true! - but it works! - amazing
One Star <SEP> Not what I expected
Love! Love!Love! <SEP> Awesome music! Super inspirational! I love everything John Dreamer has to offer! You will not be disappointed in this track.
One Star <SEP> Never got the download
"Green Tile Wild <SEP> Great singer -  kind  of an acoustic/electric feel.  Would love to hear more from this singer/songwriter.  Haunting, beautiful, soulful words and sound."
One Star <SEP> I cant get this to down load so I will cancel
Don't buy <SEP> I didn't realize it was not the Alicia Keys singing until after I purchased.  Wish I could return it now.
RIngtone <SEP> Not very good because it starts to slow and isn't adequate as an alert to answer the phone.  Should start later in the music.
Addictive feel-good song <SEP> I heard this song while shopping and bought it as soon as I left the store. This hook is so addictive. Eliza has a great voice!
"Nashville, with soul <SEP> Watching a Vince Gill concert on HDNet one night, I couldn't but notice the spirited (and very attractive) backup singer in the band, and then saw the name Bekka Bramlett as the credits rolled. That sent me to the Internet and then to this fine CD. Bekka has a great story as the daughter of the much-loved Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett, a member of Fleetwood Mac for several years, a ubiquitous session artist, and a talented songwriter. She doesn't seem to have many CDs out under her own name, but she has talent to burn and I Got News for You is a great find. It's blue-eyed soul, drenched in a rich Nashville sound. Very, very nice."
Five Stars <SEP> Great smooth jazz!!!
Just really beautiful. Makes me think of 'Simon & Simon' <SEP> Incredible music.  Just really beautiful.  Makes me think of 'Simon & Simon'.....
"Awesome! <SEP> I have enjoyed this CD for several days, and it will stay in heavy rotation. It's a great CD."
"LOVE <SEP> The drums will take you through any day!  I have it on a continuous loop and am
 busy loving it ALL DAY"
cd won't play <SEP> it won't play.. so had so spend more money found it at a local store. it was for my daughters school project
Samadhi Sitaram <SEP> This is one of the most beautiful and enlightening Kirtans that I have ever heard.  Krishna Das has a voice that swells my heart with love and compassion.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
Four Stars <SEP> Good to relax and get deep in thought.
Five Stars <SEP> I absolutely LOVE this CD. I listen to it all the time. Love it Love it Love it!!!!
Four Stars <SEP> Very very smooth
jd <SEP> I love this music. I think it is relaxing and soothing and is the perfect music to meditate to. Hope to find more like it.
I Love Thid product! <SEP> I downloaded this mp3 with no problems at all. I love the song and I love the ability to download music that we love. This song is exceptionally smooth as it should be.
"not the whole song <SEP> not the whole song, only sings the chorus repeatedly"
Great artist. <SEP> I am highly enjoying this album! Great artist.....MUCH better in person!
Beautiful Voice <SEP> Beautiful soothing voice. I love this CD.
Avoid this version <SEP> Only a one-minute excerpt of the original. I was robbed.
"New age Bossa Nova with a mystic quality <SEP> Great song that I've added to my Bossa Nova MP3 playlist.
New age Bossa Nova with a mystic other worldly quality..
Most highly recommend."
Five Stars <SEP> It is also a greta albutm.
"This is an amazing performance by legendary artists <SEP> This is an amazing performance by legendary artists. I'm disappointed with how low Mysore Nagaraj's violin is in the mix. You can barely hear him, what a shame."
"Another ""don't miss"" song for music lovers. <SEP> Another ""don't miss"" song.  Don't just listen to one style of music;  get in the buffet.  Expand your horizon."
"hmmm <SEP> I'm also looking for the original soundtrack and wondered about this one because one of the other tracks was Miranda's Song or Theme.  Thanks for your review! Saved me from disappointment.

You might want to do what I ended up doing. Use an audio recording device on your computer, play the DVD and record from that."
"Picnic at Hanging Rock Sound Track--Not <SEP> OK, it was my error.  I thought this was the sound track to Picnic at Hanging Rock---the movie.  It is a pan flute album and not the sound track I wanted from the movie.  Only one cut is from the movie.  Yep, I know I should have read the names of the cuts but I didn't.  It is OK for what it is and the price was cheap but I was/am really looking for the sound track.  I think the title is deceiving."
"Roger Smith is Good stuff <SEP> Roger is a master at the keys, and his accompanyment including a great base guitar create magic. I can't stop listening to his music!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
"... not ""I Keep It to Myself"" (which is a wonderful song). The song downloaded was another song from ... <SEP> The song that is digitally downloaded is not ""I Keep It to Myself"" (which is a wonderful song).  The song downloaded was another song from the album."
Awesome! Relaxing and flowing <SEP> Awesome!  Relaxing and flowing.  Beautiful .
"I love it! <SEP> Great sound used it 4 or 5 clips already, awesome"
Feel good music. <SEP> This music makes us feel good.
Four Stars <SEP> Better than Buffet
Beautiful Song <SEP> Wonderful song. Peaceful. Like being out in the woods. I can almost smell the big cedar trees.  Love this song.
"The Best! <SEP> This is by far the best recorded performance of a guitarist ever committed to film or tape. It is all things at once, This film and sondtrack are required listening for musicians of all genres. History will prove that Bill Frisell is simply the best and most fearless jazz performer that this generation has ever known."
Great music. <SEP> Great music.
Four Stars <SEP> Dance able rythmic and lively for work outs and morning energy boost.
Can't hear it therefore can't review it. <SEP> I have not been able to download it so I've not listened to it. I've pressed Download a few times but nothing appears.
Great tune <SEP> I like the song. Very soothing. I will definitely think about checking out the rest of the album and maybe download the rest
"Yes, this is good. <SEP> Yes, these are good recordings of Peyote songs."
"Alexandros Xenofontos' version of Stalia Stalia is the tastiest instrumental ... <SEP> Alexandros Xenofontos' version of Stalia Stalia is the tastiest instrumental rendition of this classic song I have ever heard.  His bouzouki sings with the golden, rounded inflection of a Marinella's voice, the way she sang the song to begin with.  His playing is subtle and worth listening to."
Miss leading <SEP> The title Sonlife Radio presents Randy Knapps. I was under inpression that the songs on this CD was sung by Randy Knapp But he didn't sing any of the songs on this CD
"worst remix ever! <SEP> horrible.  i hated it.  I thought i was getting something entirely different, so i wasn't happy a bit when i played this ."
"Bizzle is a talented dude, that keeps it %100 real. Dope song! <SEP> Get this! It's a dope song and it filled with truth that mainstream hip hop needs to hear! Go go!"
dying to find this song <SEP> I heard this melody on the airplane and was dying to find it. It is the best piano version of Crazy Kids ever!
intresting <SEP> good
like it <SEP> i listen to this song everyday at work whie i sort the mail... it helps make the time go by fast!! good come back joey!
"Excellent! <SEP> The first album (Punk, Northern, and Blue) was unbelievable. And then Hollowbelly releases an album that tops it! A blend of Blues and Punk styling, twangy 3 string guitar, and throw in some political and social commentary and you have ""Back on the Ward"". Can't wait until the next release!!"
Jason Bieler is a music guru <SEP> Why are you waiting to add this to your music collection? Don't. Get it today. You won't be disappointed. Awesomeness.
"Oakenfold has done better. <SEP> Tedious Oakenfold Remix.  It's nowhere near as good as Paul's ""Ready, Steady, Go!"" which is awesome."
Five Stars <SEP> Very talented young sister and brother
"Spoken word clearly audible - buyer beware! <SEP> I really want to like this album, but I can't get past the audible suggestions.  I thought I had found something subliminal, and since the tracks sounded great, I just bought the thing without listening.  The speaker's voice is pleasant enough and the music is nice on it's own, but I didn't want to hear the speaker talking!  This just doesn't meet my needs because the words are distracting to me.  If I had known the words were audible, I would not have purchased this cd."
"It's Groovy!! I Love It! <SEP> Definitely dig the Neo-Soul, Indie-Pop, Funk vibe of the album. The mesh between the warmth of classic funk and soul and the sleekness of contemporary pop and R&B is apparent. It's definitely worth checking out!!"
"Bought it but never received it. Shame on you Kindle/Amazon <SEP> Amazon or Kindle!!! Who is to blame for not delivering this to my device?
This is why itunes is kicking you guy's arse."
haciendamotel <SEP> I did not mean to order these songs I had just got my kindle I must have pushed a wrong button this music is horrible.
"Five Stars <SEP> the record was in great condition, and I really enjoyed it"
Solido <SEP> This is a very good song from solido. If your a big fan than It is a must get :)
Love it <SEP> Solido is one of my all time favorite groups and this newest album is just proof of why I love them!
Five Stars <SEP> good
"Larisa never disappoints! <SEP> I have been a fan of Larisa's for years, and this recording just doesn't disappoint. I find myself humming it all the time lately! Wonderful."
Trash. Why recording companies are allowed to record and ... <SEP> Trash. Why recording companies are allowed to record and sell this filth is beyond me. DO NOT LET ANYONE - INCLUDING FAMILY - HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR PASSWORDS.
"Al these .... on my.... <SEP> If you like drumb and bass, trap, trance or dubstep genres check out this track. The drop hits hard at "".45"" then you will be bouncing your head to the beat. This track is explicit and I have no problem with it. This track will make your head bounce."
Five Stars <SEP> Great
Five Stars <SEP> Voice of an angel
Five Stars <SEP> It's all good. The CD was as presented and arrived promptly. No problems
Four Stars <SEP> Good tune...nice up beat version and synth addage to enhance the music.
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent can't stop listening
Beautiful"
"Change energies- God's energy's awesome <SEP> We used to go to Revival services for revival. This song is revival services in a song. Let God renew you through a song! People change,  they need to."
"not your dad's Gospel <SEP> God seems to want new....music. Elvis said in '68, ""music changes every 6 months."" We understand by now. This is music for today! With elements of Louie and Della Reese, Ella Fitsgerald but with a modern context. Wrap your head around this, you'll want it!"
"I thought it was a cd! Just didn't read ... <SEP> I thought it was a cd! Just didn't read the post carefully, I guess.  Mailed it to my brother-in-law, who still has a turntable."
Five Stars <SEP> Swangin
"It just pulled at my heart like nothing has in a very long time <SEP> I have been humbled today.  Haven't listened to any of Michael's music since the first version of In Christ Alone.  Was streaming as I was doing chores around the house.  When he started singing In Christ Alone on this CD ... I literally stopped what I was doing, sat down and listened to the emotion in his voice as he sang.  As a previous reviewer said, if you know about his past,  you can feel the reverence he shows for Christ pulling him through.  It just pulled at my heart like nothing has in a very long time.  It is a great reminder that Christ will help me through those tough times in my life, too.  Immediately purchased as soon as the song was over before even listening to the rest of the CD.  Best wishes and God Bless you, Michael English."
Five Stars <SEP> Great CD! What a talent.
Good song <SEP> I like the way the song builds to the heavy solo. I can't speak for the rest of this album.
"Not the full song <SEP> I was happy to find this song on Amazon and downloaded it immediately.  Unfortunately, the song cuts off around 1:40, well before the song should end.  I tried downloading it several times and I've played it on multiple computers, all to no avail."
"Beautiful inspirational song <SEP> This song has great lyrics, a wonderful melody and is performed excellently!  I love Third Day and Mac Powell in anything they do."
"Heiruspecs have it all <SEP> Great bass, guitar, rhymes etc.  This band has it all and with Felix spitting the rhymes, the sounds are dope."
This is the work that accompanies the documentary In Vogue:The Editor's Eye <SEP> This wonderful musical composition was created in conjunction with the documentary In Vogue: The Editor's Eye and contains the words of those talented  individuals (each with a unique vision)  who worked for the magazine. As soon as I finished watching  the documentary and listened to The Butterfly ( it plays through the end credits)  I knew I had to track it down and also discover more about Lucian Piane.
"Not the real deal and should not be the first in a search for Lightning Bolt by Jake Bugg <SEP> I hate when I search a song and instead of the specific song, with artist I got this crap. I wanted the real song, not a ""tribute"". This was the first one in my search and I was buying so many songs that I missed this. I wish I never hit buy. I do love Amazon but I should have bought this one on iTunes."
"I definitely can recommend! <SEP> peaceful, harmonious, definite melody line...beautiful!"
"Moby Grape at Their Best <SEP> This song is one of the forgotten classics of the 1960's. If a record ever truly deserved to be a monster hit and yet wasn't it was ""Omaha."" Also known as ""Listen My Friends"" it is in my opinion Moby Grape and particularly the late Skip Spence at their best. The song pours out psychic energy and lifts you as only few songs can do. Only one other record made me feel like I was physically smashed against the wall like this one and that occurred the first time I heard ""Anarchy in the UK."" Get the first Moby Grape album, it's truly great."
"Shortest m3 ever! <SEP> As a huge Judy fan, I bought this for a St. Patrick's Day playlist. I listened to the preview sample and liked it. Imagine my surprise when the whole track was only a few seconds longer than the preview! I love zjudy, but what a waste."
Hot music is HOT <SEP> This song is one of my favorite house music songs. I made it my alarm clock ringtone so I could wake up to it each morning.
"I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your ... <SEP> song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead."
hated <SEP> didnt care for this app at all...thought it would be entertaining and exciting but wasn't impressed with it at all....
Wave <SEP> Not my thing. I listened but couldn't stay with it very long. I don't want to say much more but need so many words to send my rating.
"Not my style. <SEP> I did not like it after listening to it for a few times.
I would not buy it from the store."
"Bad Day in Symphony Hall <SEP> I really liked Janis's performance of the Rachmaninoff Concerto #1 (with Reiner and the Chicago Symphony) and I'm a Munch fan, so this seemed a safe bet.  Wrong.  There doesn't seem to be anything like a meeting of the minds and Munch seems to be in a hurry to get this over with, perhaps to get back to some Berlioz (although his Brahms is always worth hearing, too).  This is the severely cut version of the score, too, that was common at the time (1957).

Avoid this one and if you want a Rachmaninoff #3 in the grand manner and uncut, look for the recording Ashkenazy made with Ormandy (RCA/Sony) in 1975."
"Audio track from a good lesbian flick <SEP> This is a beautiful piece from 'A Perfect Ending,' which I thought was a well done lesbian flick, with beautiful feminine (believable) actors.  A decent story, well acted, great direction and very enjoyable.  I only wish the ending was different . . . still. . .this recording is lovely."
"best music ever !!! <SEP> A beautiful, romantic, inspiring and relaxing music, LOVE IT !!! ""A Perfect Pavane "" song expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent."
"Kelly does it again!!! <SEP> Phenomenal !!!  An awesome performer. Keep it up Kelly ..... Ms Diva 2013,,,,

Kisses down low!!! Woop Hooo!! Go Girl!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful voice!
"Should have listened to more cuts <SEP> Saw this at a very low price,listened to the sample of the first cut and figured for the money I'd give it a try. Once I bought it I listened to parts of every song and it's not very good. Voices and music sounds like it was just slapped together to get out an Irish album. Will give it one more listen to the whole album but I will most likely delete the album."
"Not very good. <SEP> I paid .99 cents for this CD and I'm glad I didn't spend more. I wasn't sure about the band of singers so I thought I'd take a chance. If you like Irish music and listen to the Clancey Brothers, Tommy Maken, the Dubliners or others you will agree this CD is poor. Not the worst I've ever heard but I want my dollar back."
"Best Dance music  EVER!! <SEP> Grata beat, wonderful rhythm and infecting melodies. A good blend of solid beat and an outrageous groove. This whole album is just fantastic."
"OK. <SEP> So-so singing, not a great production... All songs sound similar.  Kind of a flat sounding recording to me.  There must be something better out there."
Earthy rhythms <SEP> This is my favorite song so far of Valerie's. I love the earthy rhythms.
"Popular music ftom 70+ years ago. <SEP> I was familiar with one of the singers in this collection, from a casette tape purchased in NYC Chinatown over 20 years ago.
Glad to have her and others of the genre in digital form!"
"Sixties Greats <SEP> The voice and the delivery brought new meanings in the mind of a teenager. After all, he was the teenage idol."
Amazing <SEP> Ane Brun has a very unique voice.  You can hear the emotion in her vocals that compliment the lyrics perfectly.
"Five Stars <SEP> love the music, these two guys are
great together"
Five Stars <SEP> okay
Two Stars <SEP> Didn't work  for our pup
"Thunderstorm noise and our puppy! Glad I got it. <SEP> This cd, I believe, has helped my Shih Tzu puppy. He's 9 months old now and so far he hasn't been bothered by thunder. We've followed the suggestions and have learned a lot. I'm really happy that it was suggested to me and more people should try it!"
"Too bad. It seems like it would but he doesn't ... <SEP> I don't ""hate it"", it just didn't work for my dog.  Too bad.  It seems like it would but he doesn't get worried at all with these recordings, even when played full volume but one (real) firework or lightening strike miles away and he is a crazy mess."
Waste of money <SEP> Waste of money.  Our dog was perfectly calm as long as the thunderstorm sound was accompanied by music.  It did absolutely NOTHING for her fear during a real storm.  Total waste of money
"Didn't like it <SEP> This cd just didn't cut it with me or my dog.  Wasn't smooth as it should be, IMO."
"5**+ but introduce very slow or dog may go into melt down! <SEP> This CD is is almost too Good!! I'm having to start out very slowly with my old dog living in new city life!! By the end of 2nd track, I have to turn it off, and that is with her on Prozac & Valium!! I am having to do this slowly but hope it will eventually get her used to the noises. So far the the only noise I couldn't hear was the big green dumpsters crashing to the ground from those huge diesel trucks. Other than that, it is an intense great CD but CAUTION introduce slow."
"Many of the sounds my dogs hates are leaf blowers ... <SEP> Many of the sounds my dogs hates are leaf blowers, jackhammers, trucks-backing-up noise and regular overhead airplanes (not taking off jets) were missing so I found it of little use."
Two Stars <SEP> to much music and not enough Streets noises
"BEATLES MEXICAN PRESSINGS <SEP> MEXICAN PRESSINGS of Beatles records. OK quality on record itself. Picture sleeve cheaply made XEROX quality duplication. Sleeve is 2 separate sheets of paper packaged in poor quality plastic slip on sleeve. If you're looking for quality, this isn't it.  Save your money and buy US or UK pressings. This is way over priced."
"heavy metal... <SEP> the song and beat is great, but in parts of the song, it becomes alittle to ""heavy  metal"" for my taste. had the lowered the volume on the guitars, it would have been better."
Five Stars <SEP> Smooth sound of over shadowed brother.
Very satisfied. <SEP> Outstanding. Very satisfied.
In love! <SEP> I ordered this because I was singing the Stabat Mater in college.  I absolutely LOVE this recording!  A must buy.  It is always nice to hear different groups perform the same piece and to see what different directors will do with the same work of music.  I now listen to this during my Lenten seasons!
Two Stars <SEP> Ok but wish they had the Lauper version.
"What ever happend to ""Refried Dreams"" <SEP> Another apple gone bad. This is not real Country Music its Rap.
I really enjoyed his older song ""Refried Dreams"" but this is DUNG, I love Country Music but this is not Country at all. I guess hes gone to the dark side to join Luke Bryan."
Five Stars <SEP> Grate song.
Four Stars <SEP> Love this song
Five Stars <SEP> Amazing Song! Love Love Love it! Great Collaboration!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!!
Five Stars <SEP> jc 4l
great song love it <SEP> great song love it
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song - classic Tim
great tune <SEP> Absolutely love love love this song!!! Tim McGraw is amazing! Saw him live and loved him ever since! This whole CD is pretty fantabulous!
One Star <SEP> Way to much expensive!!!
Two Stars <SEP> Eh the original is better.
mistake <SEP> I feel responsible for not liking this song because. I tried to preview the song and it didn't play but I purchased it anyway.
"Love it! <SEP> The remixes are just as great (if not better) than the original track! The remixes mess with tempo and the overall feel of the song, giving a lot of variety to those who prefer a faster song rather than a slower one. A great buy. :)"
"Amazing talent <SEP> I was lucky enough to catch Paa Kow and his band at a small venue in California. I was amazed at their original sound and ability to fuse several different styles. I paid particular attention to ""Realize"" which contains a catchy hook and some of the best solos on the album."
"just buy the original mix! <SEP> hope i can return this but cannot..thats what you get when buying songs..the original mix is still better,remixers nowadays are becomin lazy and out of ideas!"
What A Beat! (A Teen's Review) <SEP> The song title is what caught my eye on Spotify one day while browsing for new music. I decided to give it a chance and I've never regretted it; in fact it's one of my all time favorite songs and most likely one of my most listened to tracks on Spotify.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for any up-coming albums she may release!
"very bad noise, disturbing and irritating <SEP> This album is just Noise, very bad noise, disturbing and irritating, I purchased by mistake. Please  refund me."
"Not the best quality if you don't want skips in your music <SEP> Sad to say the first song has a lot of skips in it. Didn't expect that, but love the song so I will keep it."
Hail <SEP> All hail
Five Stars <SEP> Loved it
"He is God ... MY FAV Song <SEP> This song is short but too the point and great for worship! You are God, not for what you've done just God! Great Praise and worship song to prepare the Minister to preach the word."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song great vocals
"Two Stars <SEP> Passions was ok, just not as special for me as both of the Sanctuary and Sanctuary 2 were."
One Star <SEP> This CD is so disappointing after loving Imagine so much
I am an acupuncturist and this is my favorite treatment room music <SEP> I am an acupuncturist and this is my favorite treatment room music. A lot of patients have told me how much they like it and many have asked me what it was. You can engage and focus on it or you can just let it fall into the background. I use it myself for winding down at bedtime when I want to quiet my brain chatter. It works for me.
"A wonderful uplifiting and inspiring song <SEP> I have this downloaded on my cell phone and I listen to it each morning and
throughout the day when I need a lift."
"Expectation Eternal Everlasting <SEP> I love this song. My Hope is truly in Eternal Glory. It is a spinoff of
the old gospel ""Walk Around Heaven All Day"", and I love this version
a lot. Thanks."
"Song is cut off! <SEP> Great song, but this version cuts off dead at 2:39 of the 5:26 song. Needs to be reloaded into Amazon's system then redownloaded. You can get the original at i tunes until it is fixed here."
Great Rockabilly! <SEP> Great motorcycle music
I'm enjoying this series <SEP> The music is very soothing and helps to think on life's journey.
Five Stars <SEP> I love all the melodies on James Michael James on his new album by this title :)
Five Stars <SEP> Great music!
Definitely recommended. <SEP> Yet another outstanding album from Russell Donnellon.  Improvisational neoclassical and modern themes.  I have bought all his CDs.  He is one the finest guitarists I have heard.
recording only one minute long- confused <SEP> okay this song is only one minute long. I thought that was just the preview. i think amazon made some sort of mistake???
"MIYAVI IS AWESOME <SEP> This is a WONDERFUL Volume by Miyavi ! I have listened to his music in the past and was a hit and miss fan of his work, but ever respective of this Artist's talent. The Talents which he has pulled together and contributed to, in this album, are remarkable and deserve a listen & a bow. This is quite different from most of the Miyavi music which I have listened to in the past: my hat's off to Miyavi and all of the Artist, and others who worked so hard to deliver such a fine product."
I didn't even order this <SEP> I have no idea I did not order this product.
Great pop song! <SEP> Just love this song.  So fun!
A cool trance song is all I can say about this Hot hit from Europe! <SEP> See the sun is a fantastic beat sync track you have to listen to it in order to like it! Europe is always ahead of the rest of the world with Progressive Trance! and this proves it! =) Enjoy!
"The Very Best Soca Artist. <SEP> This is another excellent effort by Machel Montano.  Dancing, grooving and wining to the beats in this recording is all one needs to feel the thrill and excitment of the tropics in general and the Caribbean in particular.  Perfect for an intense work out or a feel good vibe.  I really appreciate this man's creativity and his annual effort.  BTW, check out his concerts when it comes to an area near you.  The energy is electric and addictive.  The recording does not begin to capture the awesome, overwhelming LIVE experience but is an excellent appetizer.  Bon appetite!!!!!  You are NEVER disappointed musically and proformance-wise whenever Machel is in concert.
His transatlantic collaboration with Ladysmith Black Mombassa ""Possessed"" is destined to be a classic.  Mark my word."
and not in a good way. Mardux takes your favorite pieces and adds ... <SEP> Horrifying... and not in a good way.  Mardux takes your favorite pieces and adds screams and sound effects.
Unbearable... <SEP> awful. all this does is add VERY annoying and loud screams and other like sounds. It's incredibly tacky.
Superb version <SEP> Saw them perform this at Sweetwaters' 16th Anniversary party and they nailed it!  This song took the celebration to planet X! Much FUN!
Four Stars <SEP> very good
the first 10 years (gateway worship) <SEP> This praise and worship cd is great great you won't be able to sit or stand still
One Star <SEP> bad recording
Five Stars <SEP> Very ok
BIG BIG BIG <SEP> INCREDIBLE
Drums <SEP> I love this song for the words and the drums. I think that beat is the best beat and that's why I had to have the song.
Always liked his music. Good music videos too. <SEP> <3 Alesso cX it would be an honor to meet you one day. Your music inspires me all the time.
"Los grandes tambien se equivocan!!! <SEP> Se espera y esperaba mas de estos 2 grandes cantantes ambos tienen mucha tela de donde cortar y honestamente con este material se han quedado muy pero muy cortos, debido a que la produccion tiene demasiados arreglos musicales los cuales opacan las voces de Ana Y Miguel al grado que se les escucha un tanto desafinados ya que la musica y los arreglos tienden a ser un tanto tecno y no pop
no lo recomiendo a nadie a menos que jamas hayan escuchado a Miguel y Ana, asi no notarian la gran diferencia y calidad de material editado por ellos antes. DECEPCIONANTE TRABAJO!."
Five Stars <SEP> A great song to relax.
"Strange, hauntingly beautiful, and surprisingly moving. <SEP> Haunting, beautiful, strange, uplifting...all these and more describe the music of French musician Woodkid. He is one of the most creative, original, and inventive musicians out there. And I Love You is perhaps his most moving and beautiful song.

Endlessly debatable, the symbolism and imagery-rich music videos of Woodkid are among the most brilliant and visually stunning ever made. I Love You is hauntingly poignant and tragically beautiful.

Like all Woodkid music, this is one for the ages. Five Stars."
One Star <SEP> total disappointment
"I wil never buy another Andr Rieu DVD if I don't see first what it contents <SEP> I expect to see a show of Andre Rieu, no a bunch of people, for which I did not pay to see"
Great fundraiser for a school! <SEP> This was a great CD and fundraiser for Karen's alma mater.  She could recreate if for you HS as a fundraiser.!  Contact Karen Sokolof Javitch via [...]
I never purchased this downloaded it or looked at it ... <SEP> I never purchased this downloaded it or looked at it don't know what this is either I'm going to my history and finding a lot of things that I have no idea where they came from so if there was a purchase for this it needs to be corrected also
"Great Songs from Season 1... Big Discount if You Buy The Entire Album! <SEP> Please note, this is an individual song. I purchased the entire album at a big discount at the following link:
http://www.amazon.com/review/R231A3T1X37LMZ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm

My two daughters really love the new Sofia the First TV Series that came out on Disney Channel at the beginning of 2013, following the 2012 Once Upon a Princess TV Movie. It is a cute story with cute characters. My girls have been obsessed with the movie and all the shows, and really look forward to each new episode that airs.

Each episode has great new songs and my girls quickly memorize them all. We originally purchased the Once Upon a Princess MP3 Soundtrack when it came out and the girls love it. We were very happy to see that they also released the TV Series songs in an MP3 album at a significant discount so we were able to purchase all 13 songs for only $6. It is an incredible bargain. Their faces really light up when the songs start playing through the stereo. They are always very happy and love to sing along. Sound Quality is great. Song Quality is great. These MP3's are Highly Recommended Downloads for any Sofia The First fan."
"Great way to review and remember many residency and board-specific topics. Recommended <SEP> Excellent review source for residency, boards and general knowledge. Funny and involving."
"sorry i got it ! <SEP> did not like it after i got it , i did like the 20 second pre view of it , to bad amazon don't do refunds on mp3's !"
Five Stars <SEP> Crazy awesome beat. I get my dishes done hearing this tune.
Among the best. <SEP> Guitar classics. Among the best.
Two Stars <SEP> Unimaginative scoring and no stereo.
"Very Good! <SEP> Great, how can you not love good music."
Two Stars <SEP> LIKED BLURRED LINES BETTER. Like him J.T.---lots of talent---funny guy--seen him on J.FALLON SHOW many times--loved it! Not a fan of JAY Z------MR. TALK A SONG.>>>HOW HE MADE MILLIONS IS BEYOND ME----PLUS HE'S AGLY---GETTO-ISH W/MILLIONS.  Him and his slutty wife---why does all these females have to sell a song with theIR privates hangin' out. Doin' the twerk--shakin' the booty thing---REALLY NOW!____????? REALLY And she> can sing--don't need to teach her kid how to act like she does---SLUTTY--BAD!
Love is War <SEP> Forgiveness runs in His Blood is a reminder that we may need to pass through the desert of hatred to find the to find love. It is a worthwhile journey :)
"Great <SEP> A really lovely, lullaby-like version of this song. I find it addicting and want to keep listening to it and learn the words so I can sing along to it."
"I love the film Sayonara <SEP> I love the film Sayonara, so I love the theme song. Has been a favorite of mine since I saw the movie years ago. This rendition had a more oriental feel to it with the flutes and the reason I chose it."
"THE BEST BAND FROM LUBBOCK SINCE THE CRICKETS <SEP> One of the hardest workings bands from Lubbock. I've seen a Beuamonts show a many a time ad this beautifully packaged vinyl captures the spirit of the Beaumonts. If you like Jon Wayne, Frank Zappa, and other off the wall musicians, you will enjoy the Beaumonts. It takes a sense of humor, so I hope your senses are big."
"Will settle into your subconscious and never leave... <SEP> Nonagon is a calm and collected musical genius, effortlessly melding genres from ambient drum'n'bass to downtempo IDM. This album is a masterpiece that will linger longingly in your subconscious, with gorgeous productions that surge and flow. His intricate melodic beatscapes are both stirring and alive, and if you are lucky enough to catch him performing live, you will witness him recreating them seamlessly with his glowing Monome.

I have this album on constant rotation, probably played more times than any other album of the last 3 years. There are so many beautiful layers and intricacies that will entice you to return again and again, and on each listen I am still uncovering something new, sometimes subtle, but always heartfelt and engaging. I am extremely picky about what I listen to, and I DJ and produce electronic music myself, so I feel rather lucky to have something that I can return to so frequently and that works for so many different settings and moods. Highly highly recommended."
"The centre of the record is missing <SEP> Great song by an oustanding artist. A problem is that the centre of the record is missing, so as to facilitate its use in a juke box. This makes in unstable on a normal record turntable, which affects sound quality."
"Melodic <SEP> This song takes me back to the days of melodic electronic of the 80s.  Danceable, soothing and quite the sing a long song."
Almost as good as the original <SEP> Nothing like the original masterpiece On the Road to Freedom...and short too...but still enjoyable.
"Five Stars <SEP> Fun and talented band, especially if you look them up on YouTube!"
"She is golden <SEP> This song got me through. Heard on ""The other woman ."" sound track. Gonna support this artist, she isfrom my neck of the woods.  God bless you, Brit"
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent movie, great cast."
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
"Great song. <SEP> If you enjoy Jeremy Camp's worship style, then you will definitely enjoy the song Reckless. In fact, I enjoy the whole album."
"Not what you think <SEP> Not the actual artists or songs...  Glad it was free, I would have been mad if I paid for it."
"I am very disappointed with this product <SEP> I am very disappointed with this product. Here, JK-Z makes the point that stress reduction is critically important and that mindfulness meditation is just what the doctor ordered. However, it does not contain stress reduction exercises! There are just snippets from workshops. Particularly disappointing was an illustration where JK-Z opened-up a banana. Without video, it was stress-inducing, not reducing. Save your money. He has better material elsewhere."
"Much to be desired <SEP> After listening to the first 20 minutes, this doesn't appear to be more than a collection of sentences and excerpts from various speaking arrangements. I was looking for something more cohesive, so I've yet to finish it.

While this may be useful to some, I can't say that I'd recommend this over any of the other works by the author."
definitely one of the best remixes I've heard <SEP> definitely one of the best remixes I've heard. Currently my favorite song.
"Love this track, but love the acoustic version even better <SEP> I absolutely love this track, but I love the acoustic version, featured on the music video, even better. I wish Balkan Beatbox would make the acoustic version available on mp3."
"Agree with Laurie Jane <SEP> Same comment about the mislabeling of this in the library for Prime music.  The contents are not ""Sketches of Spain"" though they are good music featuring the inimitable Miles Davis"
"Marjorie Morningstar <SEP> The movie, Marjorie Morningstar  is one of my favorite movies.  This song is the music they played throughout the movie.  It's so beautiful I just wanted to be able to play it when I want.  And Doris Day sings it with all the passion that was is the movie."
"The music is interesting, but the tracks are not ... <SEP> The music is interesting, but the tracks are not long enough. The songs are repeated on the same track, but I would simply prefer a longer version of the same song. Also, several songs seem to be missing the first tenth of a second or so of the introduction. Disappointing."
"Wonderful Ballet Class Music <SEP> This music is perfect for teaching ballet on many levels - the tempo and dynamics are clearly played, and the choices of music are melodious and engaging.  The selections alternate between well-known classical pieces, popular music and compositions by Ms. MacIver.  I have only used the music once so far, but felt that it worked very well with my syllabus."
Five Stars <SEP> Love Doris Day and the song is one of my faves
"A big disappointment. <SEP> Many of the songs are from Rosemary Clooney and they aren't that great. I was expecting songs from the Ratpack, not this odd collection."
"Bait and Switch? <SEP> I was trying to download Christmas with the Rat Pack and was reading the product reviews for that- when I clicked on the mp3 download button, I ended up with this. Completely different artists and songs and a complete waste of money."
alittle scary <SEP> if you liked undertaker in 1999 and you wanted his record this is best for you undertaker  ministry of darkness
Great reminiscing! <SEP> Untraditional Stan Getz but my favorite from the Fusion era.  I had the LP but lost it and was ELATED to discover the mp3 version.  Brings back good memories and is musically an excellent listen.
"Great duet. <SEP> I loved this song on Season 4, and I'm glad I get to own it now! Great song to have."
"NONE OF THESE CUTS ARE RARE.. THOUGH SOME ARE PRECIOUS <SEP> THIS IS A VERY MISLEADING TITLE..IT WOULD BE OF INTEREST ONLY TO NANCY WILSON COLLECTORS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN MS WILSONS PRE CAPITOL RECORDS ALBUMS WHICH DEBUTED IN 1960..SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY RECORDED WITH RUSTY BRYANTS BAND AND HAD SESSIONS RELEASED IN THE LATE 50'S, NONE OF WHICH ARE IN THIS  RELEASE..ALL THE CUTS HERE HAVE BEEN RELEASED MANY TIMES AND ALL ARE POST 1960 RELEASES"
"The Best <SEP> Chris is an amazing singer/songwriter. Every single track on this album is exceptional, without a doubt. Love the ukelele tracks at the end."
Beautiful song <SEP> I hate Ricardo but love India. Together they make a magical team and the product is just beautiful. Totally recommended
"I'm not too sure about it. <SEP> It was okay, I thought it was doctor P, but that was explicit. Too bad. This is my Ma's account, by the way."
A must for ghost story fans <SEP> It's so nice to be able to take in the amazingly creepy stories of M.R. James with free hands.  Great for long walks on grey days.  Bart Wolfe's narration is spot on and easy to listen to.  If you love M.R. James and need your fix of ghost stories on a regular basis this is for you!
Not the original and a total let down <SEP> This is not the original with a steel guitar that he made talk what a total dissapointment. Don't waste your money
"Grows on me <SEP> Although at first, this song didn't catch my attention, I've learned to love this song.  It's very uplifting and makes a great addition to my running playlist."
Sings very good <SEP> Love her voice and hope she goes far in her life... She is beautiful and great actress too. Keep it up Megan!
Five Stars <SEP> Great Sly...
"Awesome!!!!!!!!!! <SEP> I just really love this music and the online video from Arianna's web site is a must to see!!!!!!!!! Marielle, West Chester, PA"
Give me the urge to go to the ocean! <SEP> I didn't know Arianna before but her pairing with Pitbull is excellent and showcases her incredible voice. Very cool song.
"He's capable of much better... <SEP> Marc Martel is incredibly talented, and was part of an amazing yet under-appreciated band called downhere. After gaining notoriety through a viral video auditioning for a Queen tribute band, he's understandably trying to capitalize on his notoriety by releasing the piecemeal solo efforts here, but it doesn't sound much like the Marc Martel from downhere. I mean... it SOUNDS like him, but the style is... bland. It's the kind of thing that sounds like the result of a focus group trying to identify the fundamental elements of popular music that will appeal to the most people... It's got all right the pieces, but it's nothing special. It sounds so familiar that by the time you've heard it once, you've had enough. It's not bad... it's just there.

As someone familiar with downhere's work, it's somewhat disappointing to hear the comparative shallowness lyrically when compared to any downhere album. Downhere fans will also miss hearing Jason's voice blending with Marc's, and the chemistry of the rest of the band that supported them.

Overall, it's not terrible, but it could have been so much better."
Nice. <SEP> Another underground guy that has sick tunes & a great message that's solid in the Word. None of his songs had titles that really appealed to me as i looked for guys repping Christ- I especially hesitated on an album called Mic Check- but i'm so glad i previewed him anyway! Pretty cool! Keep doing your thing & saturating your albums with Truth!! Love it.
"AMAZING ELECTRONIC MUSIC <SEP> This is one of the greatest electronic music albums Ive heard in a long time!

Completely original, high energy, soothing melodies, and heavy bass this is just KINTYRE all around."
"Absolutely unlistenable <SEP> This book is absolutely unlistenable.  It appears to be ""read"" by a a digitally produced replica of a human.  Unless you like listening to a being who's INCAPABLE of recovery because he is devoid of a soul altogether, avoid this at all costs."
Love IT <SEP> The first time I heard this tune I was sold!!! This group from Australia is going to do well. The video for this song is pretty incredible as well!! They have only released a few tunes as EP but I am hoping a full fledge album is close at hand. I will certainly buy it as soon as it is released.!!!
"Beautiful <SEP> This sounded wonderful at my wedding! Don't be fooled, this isn't ""elevator"" music.  It's classical American jazz with a modern flair."
"Not what i thought it was <SEP> This is not what i thought it was at all. I expecting the songs with lyrics, not just the background music through the whole movie, save your money!"
"Tokens <SEP> Columbus Road celebrates its 25 year history with this token - 17 fantastic songs that I can't stop listening to. Allan Watson and Gordon Davidson have recycled and rerecorded their greatest hits, repackaging them with a beautiful mandala cover design. Particular favorites are ""Do You"", a deceptively cheery ditty about the writer/reader relationship gone wrong; ""Hallowed Halls"", an anthem to the emptiness of urban life; ""Love Tokens"" about jealousy and murder; ""Rain"" a Beatlesque acoustic love song, and ""Red Kite"", dreamy and lovely. And if you love Allan's novel Dreaming in the Snakepark, do not miss ""It's So Nice, It's So Warm"" in his inimitable haunting and twisted style. The beautiful vocals and arrangements will have you asking when the next album will be. Their previous superb albums, Prospect and Fragments, are also on Amazon."
"Great Recipes and Beautiful Pictures <SEP> Gave this to my wife, who loves to cook! She loves it. I has great pictures to go along with wonderful recipes. Everything she makes out of the cookbook is delicious.  We also did a gift exchange at christmas time, and the cookbook kept getting ""stolen"" by other cooks!"
Four Stars <SEP> A nice throwback r &b jam ;)
"PAID BUT GOT NOTHING <SEP> I spent over 1 hour trying to down load this music. got billed, but no music. my last AMAZON PURCHASE  I finally got my song"
One Star <SEP> THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE I BOUGHT
"A New Sound- The lyrics and beats are hypnotic <SEP> The sound is refreshing, the lyrics along with the beats reminds me of monks chanting. This song along with several others off this album is in heavy rotation for me. If u want something new and HOT try this song it won't disappoint."
"Crap <SEP> I thought this was the clean version from Macklemore. NOT!!! Want clean version for my 6 yr old son for he loves it, but this version is crap. Even when my son started listening to it, he said ""mom, this is NOT the right song"". Very disappointed 6 yr old and mom for I paid for this crap."
"Clairvoyant Eye? <SEP> I remember first hearing Naked Eye by Luscious Jackson as a teenager during the 90s (the song played both on television and the alternative rock radio station near where I lived). Obviously, I still find this song enthralling to this day, yet wish that I could understand the full meaning. The song mixes elements of indie rock, alternative rock, and hints of electronica with the lyrics with my naked eye I saw the falling rain. Im only guessing that maybe the song is about accepting things as they are yet simultaneously seeing things as they are (past the illusion of how it appears to be on the external surface). Regardless if my interpretation is correct (or somewhere outside of the ballpark metaphorically speaking), Naked Eye by is great for those who enjoy 90s alternative rock/indie songs."
rip off <SEP> This is only 32 seconds of Ricky talking? wtf? I should not have to pay a dollar for this nonsense.
"Great Song, Amazon downloads the wrong song <SEP> Wait until Amazon get's this problem fixed. Also, it's difficult to reverse digital orders. Took 20 minutes to find out how and a phone call."
Tinny MP3 repro <SEP> The music is excellent but the  reproduced audio quality is terrible. Tinny. I will be embarrassed having my friends listen to it as one of  my favorite music. I remember the sound of the original 1959 LP version and it was great. I want a better version as replacement.
"you would probably be disappointed with this album <SEP> as a huge fan of deathrock and darkwave music, I had been a fan of tragic black with the decadent requiem. their unique blend of synth and darkwave with oldschool deathrock is what really drew me in. and you're the same way, you would probably be disappointed with this album. I know it's typical for people to say ""the old stuff is better"" when talking about bands. and most of the time I find people say that out of nostalgia than for the quality of the music. but in the case of tragic black, I think that holds merit. the eternal now if you ask me, is not a gothic rock album. it's a straight up punk rock album. only one song contains any synth. the rest is abrasive punk rock. and even for a punk rock album, I don't think it's that great. if you are a punk rock fan, then you'd probably enjoy it. but if you're more a gothrock and darkwave fan like me, then I don't recommend it. I would instead recommend the decadent requiem and cold caress."
"the album is different than Pandora <SEP> Bought this because I like the cut that is played on Pandora,  This is OK, but is not the knok out arrangement I tried to get.  My fault.  But other tracks and  by Men Aloud are well worth the money."
"One Star <SEP> Not into Rap, dj purposes only."
Five Stars <SEP> I love the songs... awesome voice
"philly215 <SEP> I love the whole cd, but I really love sweet love. It's like they say what you want to hear. Amen to that!"
Dissapointed <SEP> I expected a relaxing experience listening to music.  This CD has a voice over the whole way. It would have been nice if it had one track that was just soothing music.  I found it quite jarring and not the least bit relaxing.  If you are someone who needs to have someone verbally take you to a relaxing state this is the CD for you.
Corrupted file <SEP> This song is corrupted towards the end.  Disappointing buy.
"Dug out from the ashes <SEP> Hadn't heard this song in forever. Whilst in the midst of trying to think of old 80's rock songs for a compilation I was putting together this song finally came to mind. I couldn't remember the band until I looked it up on Amazon and checked it out. I purchased it because I felt it made the cut. Hearing this for the first time in forever I think its a pretty decent song. I like the female vocals, I think she has a good voice. Good song."
"Sit back and just listen! <SEP> Who doesn't love a rainy day? Wish I had a covered porch to sit back and listen to these. Instead, my easy chair will do."
Five Stars <SEP> love this song recommend u buy it
"WOW!! <SEP> I always like what the RZA has to offer....
EXCEPTIONAL!!"
"... and Tom Waits growling out a sea chantey sounds like an awesome thing <SEP> Keith Richards and Tom Waits growling out a sea chantey sounds like an awesome thing, unfortunately this track does not sound awesome. Maybe It was the chantey it's self, but the growling is nearly unintelligible, and actual sailors of the time probably sang leagues better. Where and why it went wrong I could not tell you, but the production and especially the delivery were poor, These two could have done so much better."
"Great sound <SEP> I heard this on a late night talk show and really liked the sound.  It is my kind of music right from the start.  It is a little Elvis-like with blue grass.  I wish that the Americans had more to offer in their music selections, I would buy it all.  I listen to this all the time."
"Unfortunately mp3 quality only <SEP> Guys, how come there is no CD available? Also rap sounds much better in good sound quality. Stay away with this mp3 and give me the CD! I am not spending big bucks on poor quality!"
Five Stars <SEP> Loved it!!!!
Gemstone classic <SEP> All I can say is this is a diamond in the dirt.
BEST INDUSTRIAL/ELECTRONIC ALBUM EVER <SEP> BEST INDUSTRIAL/ELECTRONIC ALBUM EVER!!!!! THIS ALBUM IS DOOOOOPE!!!! All three Chainreactor albums are REALLY sick but this is the best!
Gangnam Style acoustic version <SEP> Amazing version of this song. One of my favorite acoustic songs of all tim.  Super funky Korean superstars to be!
Solti/Nilsson with Vienna Phil for half the cost and all the quality. <SEP> Amazing value for a quality recording with a stellar cast!
"This is a well loved, unforgettable historic performance <SEP> This is a well loved, unforgettable historic performance, especially  for all of us who saw it the old Met after standing on line for hours to get in. Reiner was superb, as always in Strauss, and he would continue unsurpassed for years. At that time, we were not so pleased with Herbert Jannsen'Jochanaan, but now we can appreciate what he was, a lyric baritone, maybe miscast, but singing very well, not the heldenbariton expected in the role after the heftier Joel Berglund. But this captures Ljuba at her glorious peak, as the later Met  broadcast finds her past her best. Although there would be many other recordings in more lush sound, it is good to have this available, a must for all Strauss lovers, even with all the other excellent sopranos who tackle this role, she continues to hold her own, an unmistakable voice."
Sounds great!! <SEP> Great song. Band sounds strong. Loved this band since the 80's. One of the few from this era that has original lineup and looks/sounds current without sacrificing their sound.
"Hot Rock! <SEP> This is Stryper at their best.  It's great to hear a straight forward rock these days.  Even better to hear one so expertly performed.  Even better with lyrics that are worth paying attention to.

Can't wait for the full CD!  (yes I still buy CDs)."
Two Stars <SEP> This album has a couple of gems.  The production needs some work.
"""same style of the song 'God' from The Covering""? <SEP> This song this more to reminiscent of the album Reborn,is very melodic,modern and heavy, while God, remember more THWTD era...I hope the next album is not a second Reborn."
"Bleeding from Inside Out is AMAZING! <SEP> This song once again shows the depth of talent of all 4 members of Stryper.  This song is in the same style of the song 'God' from The Covering.  Just amazing vocal tones, guitars, bass and drums.  The song kicks in much like 'Heaven and Hell' from The Covering and the proceeds to take you on a complex journey.  This is one of those songs like 'Bohemian Rhapsody' from Queen;  Very deep lyrics, not preachy, music that takes you from rock to metal, to orchestral metal and ends with a nice soft keyboard balad.  This CD will really show how much these 4 guys have progressed musicially and how hard they have remained in their faith!  Stryper is back!!"
"One of the rare cases <SEP> I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
This album is not thought through at all. Its sadly one of those albums when Mr. Chesky was not in a good mood to produce something brilliant (and he is one of the best producers and artist). I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, unless they are a bit loony."
"Beautiful & Brilliant! <SEP> Sophisticated upbeat jazz at its very best! Original compositions that reach & touch the ""Pockets"" of your soul. Sassy sax & incredible piano played like you've never heard before."
"Rock and Rollin' <SEP> What can I say- I'm not a Great White fan in general, but I grew up knowing their hits and hearing the albums through friends and family who liked them. Well, I seem to be listing to way heavier stuff these days compared to what I grew up on because there is a lot of double-bass drumming (great drumming in general ) that I am loving!
Well, sometimes you got to take a break and relax a little. This is where and when I discovered this album for only $2.19!! It is a straight forward blues/rock (whatever) album and it does a good job at rockin me, and my ears. I can't believe there's no more rock (at least where I live) on the radio and you can forget to find anything heavier! Support hard rock and heavy metal and buy this and every album you can!!!"
"THIS IS NOT AN INTRUMENTAL CD <SEP> I don't usually review music, if I bought it, it's good BUT the problem I have with this CD here is that I want to hear the Braxton Brothers play NOT hear other people singing! Let them get their own CD and sing all they want! One maybe two songs with singing in it is okay but more than half is not! I only liked 3 songs off this CD. Again I want to hear the brothers play!"
if you like ? <SEP> i did not care to much for this! i like classics. but i could not get with this one. but ime not a crttic. i like  whate i like. somone may like! thats what music is all about
"Nice CD from the Braxton Brothers <SEP> The Sound Brothers, the Smooth Brothers, Gifted Brothers....  Nice CD from the Braxton Brothers"
Five Stars <SEP> Good collection of my favorite classical selections.
Strange But Good - Really Good! <SEP> I bought this CD from another web site a few weeks ago. It's one of my new favorites on my ipod. I can't quite figure this stuff out.  I'd have a hard time picking a specific genre - I would just say listen to it yourself - it's definitely worth it.  The best track is called Not a Number - this song really rocks! My second favorite is probably Satin Ice. I like all the tracks so I can't really point to anything in particular I don't like. Maybe some of the stuff that sounds classical doesn't fit in with the overall style. I recommend this album to anyone who likes new and different music.
Beautiful music <SEP> I thoroughly enjoy it. CD is high quality.
Help <SEP> How can I buy the cd? All I can find is mp3 downloads.
"This was NOT what I was expecting from the posted ... <SEP> This was NOT what I was expecting from the posted sample. Should have checked Youtube before I bought it.

The original is catchy as hell."
"Just love, love it <SEP> I have listened to this whole CD everyday since I got it.... Just love, love it, as well as the entire CD with the song ""saddle up"" on it....I am  from Savannah Georgia so these young men give their music  an even
 more special meaning too me."
Awesome voices. <SEP> These brothers can sing!  Saw them at FBCG in Maryland.  Awesome voices.
Two Stars <SEP> Too many songs.
"Amazon, please read my review before posting.  Hidalgo boogie is fine, its just I wasn't able to move it to my I-tunes. <SEP> actually I needed it for a line dance that I do, but I couldn't get it to move over to my I-tunes section that I've had for
years.  I had just recently decided to try Amazon because I couldn't find the music on my normal I-tunes. It could be
that I'm too old and don't do well on the computer if its not my normal routine. (Newlun)"
Awful!!! <SEP> Terrible song!!!  Tahiry can NOT sing!!! Do not buy this song...complete waste of money! I wish I didn't buy it.
"Rotten Garbage <SEP> Really? This has got to be a joke. You show your behind on tv and now your a ""singer""....This is a slap in the face to legends like the late great whitney Houston who dedicated her whole life to making beautiful music. This chick needs to have several seats."
Mediocre is a compliment <SEP> Perusing music for a movie company and came across this. Wow! Can anyone really put their music on here and call themselves musicians? All this group's music sounds the same and wreaks of wannabe talent. It's apparent the singer lacks passion and the guitarist is self taught with no natural ability and needs some lessons in creativity. The drummer is the only asset this band has. I hope they didn't quit their day jobs!
Vanderpump Rules <SEP> Ever since I her this song on Vanderpump Rules I fell in love. Great song!
"Great music! <SEP> Great music listen to it all the time. Cool tunes and very relaxing actually.
Waiting for the next album!!! Enjoy."
No vocals tunes <SEP> Total let down. It's all instrumental. No good song like Tunnel of love by Fun Boy Three... When Gilbert was dancing in the park Season 1 with Annie. The vocal songs are missing.
"A lot of songs are missing <SEP> So, I purchased this from somewhere else with the intent to hear a certain song on the album...

Well... its not there. The song played when Suren died in Season 2, and when Josh and Nora dug up Sally -- but it is totally absent on this album! Maybe it will show up in another album release... who knows?

The UK version of Being Human soundtracks have EVERY SINGLE SONG even if it is only 30 seconds."
"i was upset because i thought this was the original ... <SEP> i was upset because i thought this was the original cd, but its only a copy and does not come with original art work in booklet or the cd itself."
Five Stars <SEP> great
"Big disappointment. <SEP> Did not come with the lyrics or additional materials it should have come with.  ONLY the disc, nothing else, not even a listing of the chants in order or otherwise.  Big disappointment."
System Overload <SEP> The boys are back. This is a classic system song. Funk synths and the music that keeps you going and going. I can't wait for their new Cd Album. They don't miss a beat at all. Mic with the classic vocals and David Frank with the music. Nuff said.
Defective product <SEP> There is a second of silence at the beginning of each file which is very annoying considering this is a live recording.  Completely worthless.
"Five Stars <SEP> Good item, good price, good service."
"Great song <SEP> Heard at 2014 COTA MotoGP race, wrote down lyrics caused I loved the sound.  So glad I found it!!!!  Yeah!!"
One Star <SEP> I was never actually able to download anything.
Urbie Swings with a small group <SEP> Urbie Green plays jazz standards such as Django and Four Brothers in a modern jazz sextet format. I think this is his best album on Command. The sound quality is great and the music is hard swinging versus the slower swing on the Persuasive Trombone records. Highly recommended for trombone jazz fans.
"NKOTB Still Good <SEP> If you liked NKOTB before, you'll like this song. It has a great beat and a catchy tune that sticksin your head once you hear it."
"You don't get two hours of sound effects in fact you don't even get two full minutes. <SEP> Even though you think you are buying two hours of sound effects, you only get 1.51 minutes of sound effects.  The title is very misleading as to what you actually get."
"you're sure to find at least a couple of them that you enjoy.: ) <SEP> One can hardly complain and gripe about this album when you're getting 20 music selections for the skimpy price of $7.99.  With this many songs being offered, you're sure to find at least a couple of them that you enjoy.  :)"
Watch The You Tube Video <SEP> It's terrible. The only thing worse is the video on You Tube. I think Chris is still drunk. Enough said
Am So Very Pleased with this excellent find!!! <SEP> I knew nothing about this artist (Wychazel) at all.....purchased this and (Wychazel's) Shaman 2 on a whim.  Am I glad I did as they both have become sounds I turn to consistently......grows deeper with more listening.  Am So Very Pleased with this excellent find!!! THANK YOU! Love It!!!!
"this is amazing for Christmas time listening <SEP> ...best version of this song I have ever heard--a surprise, not what you would expect. The lovely and talented Wendy Moten singing Christmas songs is as heartwarming as it gets. Check it out!"
amazing Christmas song from Wendy Moten <SEP> --this is so beautiful it will put tears in your eyes.  What a great listen for the Christmas season--Wendy Moten is the best.
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Matt Sanders - Come Hell Or High Water (Independent)
Singer-songwriter Matt Sanders has been playing guitar since his early teens, growing up in the mountains of East Tennessee and listening to James Taylor and Billy Joel. He began writing music and songs almost immediately, recording a single, ""Regrets"" while still in High School and continuing to discover new songwriters to inspire him, especially Damien Rice and Amos Lee. He recorded and released his debut album in 2010, ""Apathy Has Found Us Again"", and in the same year he headed out on the road with The Band Perry, as guitar technician for the high-flying country trio.

""Come Hell Or High Water"" was recorded within a group setting, and both Sanders and his songs seem invigorated by the process. His sound and style is contemporary, alternative folk, both soulful and emotionally open, so it's important that plenty of space is made for his songs to breathe. That's been achieved with a level of subtlety and restraint that credits the artist, his band and the production team. Opening cut, ""Train Wreck"" makes for a perfect start, its rolling rhythm underpinned by steady keys and Sanders' watertight lyricism. ""It's You"" indicates a willingness to try new things, as willful brass and percussion lay an unstable foundation for what is probably Sanders' finest vocal, and ""Ocean Tide"" is equally impressive with it's tumbledown jazz inflection."
"Loved it ! <SEP> I love absolutely everything that Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden have done together since the early Whitesnake days , and this was no exception . Great bluesy guitar rock'n'roll !"
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome voice. Amazing song.
Great for Creative Movement <SEP> I use this for my Creative Movement class: the kids love these songs!
Still a great remake of a <SEP> not the version I wanted. Still a great remake of a classic
"born loosers <SEP> I heard this song long time ago, and I didn't even knew the title of it, now im glad that I find it...great song"
"Five Stars <SEP> Lleno del Espiritu de Dios, glorioso."
Devilish record <SEP> It's obvious how much they like performing together. This is a fun record and I highly recommend it. Buy it!
WISH THERE WAS MORE! <SEP> I bought his first CD years ago and haven't seen another one since. I wish this was part of a full CD!
"Well, good if what you wanted to hear was a regular string quartet <SEP> Now WHY would 4 cellos (whose natural tone and range are the most beautiful in the world of instruments) strive to sound like a regular string quartet???????? I was hoping to hear the sonority of this beautiful instrument and what I heard instead was a wanna be string quartet. Why not capitalize on the instrument's many strengths instead of imitating something which doesn't sound as good (though VERY well done)."
"Don't waste your money <SEP> I've ordered dozens of MP3 downloads from Amazon but this is, without doubt the absolute worst.  The music sounded fine on the preview but after purchasing it, guess what? It won't open with windows media player.  All I get is a message that the filename is too long. It's on my hard drive taking up space for the time being.  I'll fiddle with it for awhile to see if I can figure out how to open a file like this and then I'll delete it.  Don't buy it. It isn't worth the aggravation."
"Better than the Original <SEP> I've never really cared for Radiohead, but Amanda Palmer knocks this song out of the park! I must have for ukulele fans as well!"
"Awesome! <SEP> Killer album! Saw these guys with Pepper, and they did not disappoint. This is by far their best album. If you're into Sublime, or older Supervillains you'll love this."
"Love Big Wreck <SEP> I love this song. Classic Big wreck slide guitar and riffs. I got this one
Song, now I'll get the whole album!"
"Not that great <SEP> I don't like it, but my little girl would probably rate it higher.  Of course I'm personally not in to teeny bobber music.  It was down loaded for her."
"The Hungry Years- Nick Ingman Orchestra <SEP> I am an avid beautiful music listener!  Nick Ingman's instrumental version of Neil Sedaka's ""The Hungry Years"" is one of the best sounding instrumentals I have heard.  I definitely recommend this track if you purchase the MP3."
This version doesn't sound as good as other recordings I've heard and I see why ... <SEP> This version doesn't sound as good as other recordings I've heard and I see why it doesn't because it's not the Righteous Brothers. I thought it was by them when I purchased it. I will delete from Amazon Music and buy the right one.
Five Stars <SEP> Soothing!
Now this is music!!! <SEP> I first heard of Janice Derosa on my local NPR radio station. This woman has an amazing voice and incredible talent. How unfortunate for mainstream America that her CDs are only available in Europe (unless purchased used and after much searching). If you can find anything by her...BUY IT!
Five Stars <SEP> My favorite band!
Gospel Music <SEP> I really enjoyed many gospel songs about heaven. Their style is unique and refreshing. I may purchase more from the Chuck Wagon gang.
Really nice kids song. <SEP> I was searching for a song that my 10 year old daughter could perform to at her school's talent show and this song fit the bill.  It's upbeat and very appropriate for her age group.
"Fun song <SEP> I used this for my kid's hip hop class. They had a blast! My adults liked it too, but I doubt they'll go out and buy the song."
"Wonderful album! <SEP> I love the tranquility that this album creates.  Great set of hymns done beautifully be these musicians.  I hope they do more recordings like this, because I will definitely buy them!  They are inspirational and peaceful.  I recommend this album if you're looking for a great instrumental rendition of favorite hymns."
"Reused Material <SEP> I've never bought a CD where the comedian reused comedy from their first album, almost half this CD is reused material. Really sad actually. Instead of purchasing this CD, I'd buying the first one and listening to it twice."
EEEEEWWWWWW <SEP> I had to burn this song for my daughter.  AWFUL!!!!!  It echoed in my head for hours and haunted my sleep.
"A Treasure! <SEP> Listening to Great Big Sky has been one of the most enjoyable album experiences I've had in quite a while. The songs are fresh but grounded in the foundations of country and folk. Dasher's first album, Long Road Now, was a rock solid tip-of-the-hat to the roots and legends of country music. He has built his second offering on those foundations but has grown from those roots and created something all his own. Great Big Sky is warmly familiar but subtly so. At the same time, it is excitingly new!

Dasher is a talented multi-instrumentalist and has a wide vocal range. His amazingly versatile voice is on fine display here...from the gentle ""Again"" to the world-weary ""I've Tried (I'm Dry)"" to the rousing ""Mountains of Montana"". ""Sun"" is quite a surprise and a very pleasant one! ""Leave the Rest Alone"" speaks to our world today. It is as timely as the haunting ""Soldier"" is timeless. There are no throwaway songs here.

One of the many things that makes the Great Big Sky experience so enjoyable is Dasher's obvious sincerity and joy. It is a lovingly crafted work and the heartfelt performances make every track a pleasure to listen to.

With evocative, deftly created lyrics, beautiful melodies and harmonies, and outstanding vocal and instrumental performances Great Big Sky is one of the most entertaining albums I've heard in a long time. I highly recommend it!"
awsome <SEP> love this song because it makes me want to dance.;)
"Beautiful rendition. <SEP> This piece is from a traditional wedding collection, but we had it played at my mother's funeral, because she loved it so much.  When I listen to it, I feel closer to her and to my creator."
dont remember buying this album <SEP> i don't remember buying this mp3 album. can you let me know when this purchase occured? Someone may have stolen my card!
Awful <SEP> Don't waste your time downloading this unless you just don't have anything else to do with your time.  Free is not the way to go in this instance.
"Eww, Gross, and let me say BARF!!! <SEP> What are we, 12?! C'mon! This is so stupid - middle-age white guys jumping around a stage, trying their best to hide their growing bald spots, screaming into a microphone. If you like feeling like you want to impale yourself in the temples, feel free - this is a free download. But buying the CD? Yeah, I'll pass..."
"Punk rock meets musical theatre. <SEP> Amanda Palmer is insanely talented, incredibly intelligent, and her music speaks to my soul.  Punk rock meets music theatre in this sophomore solo release."
Four Stars <SEP> jazzy
"An unbelieveably easy way to market himself in the two years that ... <SEP> I mean, I get it. A dude trying to get his name out, but maybe write music about something you actually know about? If this was somehow cleverly written about the history of the club and its place in Columbus, I might listen to more than five seconds of it.

Or you can make your own decision based on this ESPN interview. http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/4952/shawn-bandz-makes-columbus-crew-theme

Basically, if you're writing a song about our club, and zero supporters/zero long-time season ticket holders have a clue who you are then sorry, no one is going to buy this track. An unbelieveably easy way to market himself in the two years that he sat on this - could have came to 5 matches a season and met everyone/networked and then supporters/fans might have gone along with it.

Pass."
Terrible. <SEP> Sucks and not affiliated with the team. Just an idiot being an idiot having to drag the Crew into it for god knows what reason. Don't support him.
"Fake fan trying to make a buck off of a team <SEP> He even says in the beginning, ""we don't have a basketball team or a football team"", which makes it obvious that if Columbus DID have either of those, he'd be ""rapping"" about them instead.  It's sad that these wannabe rappers these days have to use other things to get their name out instead of finding some talent and doing it the old fashioned way.  Don't support this phony crap.  The Crew is about hard work.  Not this lazy ""swag"" crap this young generation is trying to shove down everyone's throat."
"LOVE LIFTED ME <SEP> IT IS INSPIRING, DONE WELL, WOULD APPEAL TO THE LINE DANCE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS GROUPS-I LIKE SCOOTER LEE"
Two Stars <SEP> But I only got part of .... It was difficult to download
Five Stars <SEP> Good old music for a good old dog!
Five Stars <SEP> I love this music
"Five Stars <SEP> awesome, awesome, awesome... i like texas music!"
... they were recorded from record but mostly was quite good. <SEP> Some of the tracks crackle a bit as if they were recorded from record but mostly was quite good.
"Who all loves Sara Melson's CD <SEP> It should come as no surprise that the songs and singing of Sara Melson have great appeal to audiences of her age. But I have unstinting praise from a whole other group: octogenarians. I'm a folksinger and lyricist of the old school. Like the 50's. And the range of Sara's voice, from simple to sultry, really grabbed me by the ears. Her unaffected and compelling poetic presentation didn't just bridge the gap between our generations, it made that gap disappear. I can't wait to hear Sara's next musical gifts.

"Just Once <SEP> Only listened to this once, but it did the job.  Very relaxed afterward, was even able to fall asleep - which was my goal."

Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Takes you back to the drive-in theater in the 60's. <SEP> If your mis-spent youth included nights at the drive-in theater during the 60's, you might remember this movie and song. A great rendition by Chad & Jeremy."
Five Stars <SEP> Outstanding music and group
"I Love This Band <SEP> Here is another great live concert by these guys.  If you have never seen them live, I cannot over recommend it."
"Excellent songs and superb musicianship <SEP> A great album by Tony Perrino and Jared Alpern.
Jared and Tony provide excellent keyboards and Jared plays amazing guitar.
The vocals are also top notch by Tony and he plays excellent drums on all but one tune.
Download these songs and enjoy."
"Beautiful in every way <SEP> This is one of the most moving, lovely, perfect pieces of art, music, and poetry all in one. My heart swoon and shifted throughout and that's not and easy thing for me to do. Absolutely incredible. If you don't buy it, you're missing out on everything."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Strangers and Liars - Five Seat Concert Hall (Independent)
Strangers and Liars are a four-piece American rock band from Erie, Pennsylvania, with a list of influences that include The Beatles, The Band, J.J. Cale, Warren Zevon and Tom Petty. There are definitely a few clues to their sound amongst those names, and they themselves describe what they do as `original electrified music in the American tradition'.

Indeed, the result is melodic guitar pop with a suspicion of twang and an abundance of hooks. All four members, Tommy Link (vocals and guitar), Justin Anderson (lead guitar and vocals), Russ Straub (bass) and Tom Hitt (drums and vocals) are recognised writers, though on ""Five Seat Concert Hall"" Link takes sole songwriting credits. However, it's apparent from the off that each musician brings far more than just talent and experience to the project. It sounds too good for that.

Produced by the band, and recorded in two studios in and around their hometown, ""Five Seat Concert Hall"" has been imbued with a fulsome, warm sound that draws the listener in. Without sounding much like them, I'm reminded of The Jayhawks and they way they write huge, classic pop songs without forfeiting intimacy. Strangers and Liars repeat the feat, and all ten tracks make an impression.

Of course, favourites come thick and fast; ""Broken Hearts"" arrives on big acoustic guitars, but before long Anderson is providing delicate electric detail and the chorus ingrains itself into the subconscious. ""Don't Play With Me"" ups the vitriol and borders on dark, without ever sacrificing its pop heart, and ""Along for the Ride"" treads similar ground to ""Kick"" period INXS, but with a heap more subtlety and a bucketful of feel-good charm."
"Satin Jackets make wonderful boogie disco based love music <SEP> Check out this song, perfect for those late night hands in the air sessions in your living room or at your fav clurb."
"Awesome band! <SEP> I just attended a concert in Cottonwood, AZ.  I loved them, they are fun to hear and fun to watch."
One Star <SEP> ok
??????????? Why??????? <SEP> what on earth has this to do with France? you can't be seriously telling me this is even related to Hot Club???? what a waste.....
"fan-flippin-tastic! <SEP> toe tappin, boot stompin rhythm meets beautiful melodies.
I am required to write 12 more words, and I don't know why...."
great <SEP> Excellent cd check it out if you enjoy soca music. One of my most favorite album to listen to when working out.
"ordered by mistake <SEP> there's only one Flint Eastwood, outta Michigan! Don't download this junk by mistake. I just wasted my money. money. [...]"
Either you like a groups music or you don't <SEP> Either you like a groups music or you don't.  If you like Fun's big hits I imagine you will be pleased with this album.  The little snippets you get on the sample page aren't always enough to judge a song so when it doubt hit up youtube and watch some of their videos.
Four Stars <SEP> Didn't think I'd enjoy but am very impressed with this album.
could be better <SEP> Song only did 1 of the 5 verses.  The first 2 are done well but would be better with all 5 verses.
"""Les Tournesols"" By Leah West featuring Bruno LaBrie <SEP> Leah West and Bruno LaBrie are a fantastic duo in this superbly done song! Leah West's angelic voice harmonizes perfectly with the soft soothing voice of Bruno LaBrie. I hope that there are more duets by these two yet to come! I Very Simply Love It!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> My favorite album this year.  I can't stop listening to it.  I feel like I'm really taking part in Samuel Lane's worship.  There's an authenticity in the songwriting and expression that is hard to find these days in Christian music.  This album is great if you need music that helps you to slow down and rest in the Lord.
"Absolute classic! <SEP> Truly annointed, you absolutely feel the passion to your core...heard a year ago and still listen to it like the first time. Helped me endure a season in life that was like going thru a fire. Top 5 ive ever heard for any genre of music christian or secular...cant wait to hear more from this fella."
"Five Stars <SEP> Fun, light, & highlights two incredible musical groups."
One Star <SEP> has a skip in the middle
"Thank Heavens for Dale Evans & Kristyn Harris <SEP> Thank heavens for Dale Evans and Kristyn Harris.

I tell ya what, this CowGirl can sing, pick and yodel like you wouldn't believe. She is totally awesome!

For this style of music, Kristyn Harris is the best of the best.

Hopefully  she'll put out a DVD of her performing someday soon.

I love this CD.

"It's not speaking French.  Maybe if I just chill out, I'll learn French? <SEP> If you want some semi-trippy sounding things that tell you to chill out and relax (in English) then this has what you might be looking for.  I'm not sure what it has to do with learning French, though."
Hauntingly Beautiful <SEP> Love this song. Captivating music.
"Awesome German. <SEP> I have no idea how I never heard of Faun before somehow coming across them on the net one day. But their music takes one back to another time like none other. And I love the fact it's in German. Look up a translation if you need to, but this song just wouldn't work in any other language. Listen to it, and indulge."
"love this music <SEP> i had been looking for this music for a long time
everytime i hear it am reminded of this wonderful tv series and all the enjoyment it has given me"
"Great Sound <SEP> I stumbled onto Paul Kriege's work when a friend of mine posted a YouTube of his music.  Great musical talent.  His work is comparable to the sound of Paul Hardcastle, Davol, or The Rippingtons.  I'm looking forward to his future works."
"like Brasilidade, for which nearly every track is worth ... <SEP> An enjoyable listen, but not nearly as memorable as Bossacucnova'a other releases, like Brasilidade, for which nearly every track is worth listening to again and again."
"Five Stars <SEP> After the world cup, this should ease your pain."
"Amazing, quality music!  Have to have! <SEP> This is the most amazing album. Everyone should listen to it over and over. The great harmony with guitar, drums, harmonica, and other instruments is absolutely a joy to listen to.  I love the combination of Christian music and current, everyday issues.  ""Daniel in the Lions Den"" and relating this to daily issues is a great song.  All of the songs on this album range from jazzy to soft listening, and the words and message are comforting and also inspiring.  I highly recommend listening to this album on your way to work -- it will make you have a great day!  Buy it and enjoy!"
"poor sound, poor interepretation <SEP> Blah, poor sound, poor interepretation.  I expected much more than this from PS.  Truly just a bad concept from beginning to end."
One Star <SEP> parody alright! played 1/2 song that was it
One Star <SEP> Sucks.
"Mental Health Physicians Give Analysis . . . . <SEP> ""A definitive case of psychohysterical-indifferis-subcranius-blubburisis-invertatous-idiosyplexus-stultividus"" as defined by the World Psychology Institute for Human Advancement."
my mother was duped into buying this. <SEP> my mother decided to buy me some Lindsey Stirling audio Cds and she happened to buy this cause she saw her name on this utterly worthless space waster. im all for parody videos and music but not when it tricks people into buying it. by far the worst Christmas gift ive ever gotten and ive gotten rotten food as a (gag) gift before...at least the rotten food was funny this is just shameful.
"ugh...why? <SEP> I don't get it.  Usually parodies are suppose to be funny, a little charming and reflect the original source.  This is just awful sounding.  The only way this makes sense existing at all is if Wilson and Stirling are actually really good friends and this is just some kind of inside joke.  If not, why Stirling of all people?... it makes no sense.

EDIT!:  ok.. the youtube video makes it all make a lot more sense.  its a kazoo... haha!  not sure i'd pay a $1 for that, but hey... whatever floats your boat!

@katie: it might be a good idea to put some kind of disclaimer in there so people aren't hating on you :)"
"Embarrassingly bad <SEP> Listening to just a few seconds of this should let the listener know just how terrible this is.  There are some musical spoofs that are amusing (PDQ Bach, Weird Al Yankovic).  This is just plain awful."
"Garbage <SEP> Having watched the Lindsey Stirling video this ""song"" is supposed to be a parody of, I have to say this is the worst piece of garbage I have ever found on Amazon! Other than jealousy of Lindsey's talent, I really can't image why someone would waste their time to record this, let alone sell it for $.99 (which means it is $1.00 overpriced!). Truly sad."
My song <SEP> Another song I had on repeat. Listened to this on a nice sunny day just chilling around the house. Love
Irish forever! <SEP> Absolutely the best! All of the old and the newer Irish songs and barroom ballads are always good but this collection is even better!
"Fun! <SEP> If you're a fan of fun hip hop, you'll love Sean Forbes!  And, this video is great too!  Highly recommended!"
"This song starts out slow but give it a shot. <SEP> I wasn't sure that I would like it because it starts out a little slow but it really comes together to be a fun catchy song. Even if you don't understand what they are saying you want to sing along, I am not sure what language this is. But it is fun."
meh <SEP> I bought this thinking it was an 80's song.. it wasn't. It's ok.
"Great album <SEP> Meghan Cary was Indie before Indie was cool. The former theater actress fell into songwriting through personal tragedy in the late 1990's. What began as catharsis and tribute to her then-recently deceased fianc&eacute; turned into a win of Billboard Magazine's Critics' Choice for Best Newcomer in 1998. Cary was quickly drawn into the folk scene, touring extensively and recording/releasing three critically acclaimed albums. Cary met her husband, Peter Farrell (The BlackTails) at a Meghan Cary show at CBGB's Gallery, at a time when touring was becoming old hat. She settled down and built a home and a family, but music was never really gone from her life. Cary returns on January 31, 2012 with her first album in eight years, Building This House. A story of recovery, rebuilding and ultimately, happiness, Building This House is a personal tale full of the resilience of the human spirit. And while Meghan Cary has been rightly compared to the likes of Shawn Colvin, the Indigo Girls, Natalie Merchant and Stevie Nicks over the years, on Building This House she offers a voice that's influenced by those above, but distinctly her own.

Cary gets started with the title track, a refreshingly smooth and mature piece of pop songwriting that's an ode to family to be. Cary's voice is mildly soulful, and the almost harpsichord style sound from the synth gives this something of a baroque-pop ballad feel. ""Lost You In The Light"" is a brilliant marriage of poetry and music. Cary's mildly soulful pop arrangement wraps itself around lyrics about the human tendency to lose sight of what's important from time to time. This organic blend of thought and muse reflects an artist who spends a lot of time inside her own thoughts, yet still manages to convey the output in an artful manner. ""Responsibility"" is a morality tale told from a personal perspective, reflecting on those we see around us in hardship every day. The message is solid and poignant in difficult economic times, but the subject has been covered many times over with more power. Nevertheless, the wonderfully jazzy piano work underscores an arrangement that will get this song some attention.

""I Might Miss You"" shows off Cary's ear for melody in no uncertain terms. A song about discovering what you really want after you've already cast it aside, the song's theme unrolls in your brain like it was always written there and therefore refuses to leave. This sort of honest, sweet love song is always appealing, but Cary delivers it with a sincerity and simple power that is compelling. Cary digs into a delicious blues/rock arrangement with lots of soul for ""Through Walking"". This catchy number builds slowly, and will likely become a live favorite. It would be nice to hear Cary open this one up a bit more vocally, but the song sits well as delivered.

""Invitation"" is a powerful love song that might be about opening your heart to love, or perhaps something a bit more carnal. Either way, Cary plays it straight and manages to create one of the most intriguing listens of the newborn 2012. The compact pop/rock arrangement delivers the song with an economy of style that allows the raw desire of the song to be the star. ""Darker Song"" is all about the unstable emotional ground that leads to a breakup. This woeful, haunting tune finds Cary coming to terms with what her heart has known for some time. The universal appeal of this song will come from the fact that almost anyone who hears it will have been there once in their life, and Cary captures the moment in a near-perfect blend of poetry and musical scenery.

""Moon Song"" explores the complicated emotions that arise from learning a former love has moved on. In this case he is getting married. This is all about the emotional turmoil that turns up at such a time, particularly when unsettled feelings still in play, and about the phone call or letters that happen at such times that rarely turn out of the better. Cary plays this as if she's lived it, and her representation in song is compellingly human, mixing desire, need, desperation and pain with that one little drop of hope that drives humanity to seek the impossible. This is a brilliant, if raw, piece of songwriting that will haunt you. Cary closes with ""Live!"", a Sunday go to meeting song with a single message: seize the moment. The energy here is tremendous, and punctuates the collection of songs about chances lost and gained with a simple directive: never give up on yourself.

Meghan Cary has lived both dreams and nightmares, and reflects upon them all in artful and symbolic songs on Building This House. This album is a study in remembering that not only are good experiences build us, but that the ones we'd rather forget are often even strong shapers of the people we are to become. Cary shares her story in honest and uncontrived language throughout the album, and blends these stories with arrangements that often perfectly shadow the mood of each moment. The only possible complaint about the album is that it took Meghan Cary eight years to put it all together. Listeners will find themselves fervently hoping that it won't be eight years until the next one. - Wildy's World"
"ALL HOPE IS LOST <SEP> POP ROCK AT IT'S WORST- IT'S REALLY SAD TO, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THESE GUYS HAD THE BALLS TO WRITE GOOD HARD ROCK SONGS-BUT AS I LISTEN MORE AND MORE TO THIS RECORD- NOT SO MUCH!"
"What Happened? <SEP> Den of Thieves and No time for Later, are great albums!  So what happened here?  I won't bother to look up who produced this album, but it sounds incredibly ""tin-ie"" in my car, compared to any other cd I've listened to.  I had to dramatically change my settings, just to get a decent sound out of this.  Whoever was on the mixing board, should have a refresher.

Except for a couple of songs, I'm not really feeling the ""Trews"" vibe.  I skipped 3-5 songs, after listening about half way through them, just to find something that sounded like it had some edge, or strength to it.

Love you guys, I really do.  Especially live.  Highway of Heroes is an incredible song too!  I just don't get this, at all."
One Star <SEP> Sounds nothing like the song
"I didn't order this to buy, yet was charged.  <SEP> The song isn't bad, but I didn't order it & very inconvenient to try to contact anybody electronically for music not ordered."
"Haunting, Soulful <SEP> Esza Kaye - Listening to Tinged With Machine -  I Love the haunting, yet soulful style... perfect - Review From Heart Glow Living"
"Feel Good Heartbreak <SEP> Justin Levinson is a a gifted young singer and this is an appealing record of what he calls 'feel-good heartbreak'.

Opener ""Water Wears The Rock"" is a mid-tempo song with a great chorus and a lovelorn lyric to match. ""Love You Goodbye"" features the equally gifted singer Gregory Douglass and is a catchy and charming song. The two singers are perfectly in synch. ""I Was So Wrong"" features Liz Longley for a country-fied duet that edges into the genre nicely. It's still poppy and sweet.

""If You're Happier"" closes the album on a good note, Levinson singing movingly of wanting another's happiness despite being sad they're apart. It's a wonderful album - Luna Kafe"

I have their entire playlist on repeat on my phone and it's like the most unbelievably smooth pair of voices I have heard in an extremely long time.  I originally didn't like Taylor Swift's version of this song but these two made it big for me.  I'm waiting for you guys to release your entire iTunes selection on Amazon MP3 (I have a thing against iTunes).  Although, I had a shock of horror when one of the girl's recently announced her engagement ... *shock* - there goes my chances, man!"
"frustrating <SEP> Only gave it one star, because I wanted to rate this. I thought this was the orignal version where Tamela sings her song, it wasn't just the musical version. I had to purchase this song twice."
One Star <SEP> did not order this
Ghazal <SEP> The depth and range of the collection is a listening pleasure that is truly memorable for what it is worth.
"ugh no ! <SEP> Why bother carring this title ? Bands like this won't last.
the owner of this label Dan is a complete disgrace
Anything by patac records sucks. Avoid them at all costs !"
Teddy Roosevelt Charge- P&W <SEP> P&W seems to move fast these days...the Psalmist seems to approve. These songs should move me to worship; this one does. Don't look for a tempo in the 60's but one conducive to real personal worship. They don't get better than this one.
"Great song! <SEP> Wonderful song.. wonderful group.  Also love ""Come to the Altar"""
Must have historic <SEP> No such thing as bad Barylli. The Vienna Phil stalwart in a rare solo outing.
Love this music <SEP> Love this music. It is exactly what I wanted and makes my day star toff with a happy peaceful note.
"One Star <SEP> Still, a virgin"
Where is my download <SEP> Where is my download. l bought this track only to find it only plays on my computer & is not downloaded as was my other MP3 purchase at the same time.
"Piano Sonata <SEP> Wasn't sure of it at first, but the more you listen the better it gets.  Still not one of my favorites, but nice anyhow."
Soothing Gospel Song <SEP> A hard to find wonderful gospel. I had it sung at my Mother's funeral in 2007. I think The Chuck Wagon Gang's rendition is beautiful. I have been a fan of The Chuck Wagon Gang for many years and believe their harmony is among the best (along with The Statler Brothers).
"Probably not what you are looking for <SEP> Some parts of this sound like the original 1984 singers, but others definitely do not.  The background music mix is also WAY off.  Do not buy!"
"The One Bright Spot in A Dismal Production <SEP> I have to say at the outset that I have a rather unique perspective on this soundtrack, since I am both a film score buff and a maritime / Titanic author and researcher. For any upcoming ""Titanic"" film, I am always wondering what the score will be like. How will it compare to the music for ""A Night to Remember,"" ""S.O.S. Titanic,"" John Barry's ""Raise the Titanic"", or (the true benchmark) James Horner's score for ""Titanic""?

When I heard about this production, I was rather excited to see it. As the first episode opened, I was instantly captivated by the music in the credits. Although I was unaware of the composer's name before this series, I made a mental note to see if the score would be released. Then, as I watched he series, I was appalled at its egregiously-rampant historical errors. The content of the program (which I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon) was just terrible. It was rather soap opera-ish, but it might have been bearable if it did not purport to be a portrayal of historical events. Literally the only thing that got me through every episode was the music. After I watched the series, I discovered that the only bright spot in the show - the score - was unreleased.

Just now, I have found that the score has indeed been made available, and I decided to pick it up and have a standalone listen apart from the historical butchery of the series' content. I enjoyed it so much that I listened to it three times in a row, back to back. It is captivating, engaging, and connects very well to the history of the ""Titanic"" and the excitement in Belfast surrounding her construction, launch and fitting out. Some of the music is energetic, and other passages are reflective or introspective. At times it even gets a bit ominous in tone - which is thoroughly appropriate considering where the history headed.

Although I detected very little in the way of Irish sounds, this may have been a conscious decision on the part of the composer - perhaps to distance himself from the Horner approach. In this regard, the score perhaps harks further back to the approach taken by John Barry to ""Raise the Titanic"" - it was an orchestral score along classical lines, not one filled with Irish sounds.

If I had to make a single complaint, it would be about this lack of Irish sounds, as Titanic was built in Ireland and the series is primarily set in that location. Related to this, there is one track that I very much wish had been included: the electric, hair-raising, and hauntingly beautiful rendition of the Irish folk song ""My Lagan Love"", which is sung very slowly and merged with the orchestral sounds present in the rest of the score.

However, if you like film scores and like anything connected to the ""Titanic"", you are bound to like this Grade-A score!"
"Very Calming <SEP> This is a VERY good purchase in my opinion.  Ordering by MP3 was so quick and hassle free too.  The music has such a ""peace instilling"" quality to it,  you just drift away. All the tracks are wonderful.  This is AWESOME!"
"Fan of Trio Tyket? Probably not for you <SEP> If, like me, you're a jazz aficionado, love the work of Trio Tyket and are looking for more of their music, this probably isn't what you expect. While their versatility is pretty cool, and they do a great job for the rhythm section on this album, this is basically quirky Finnish pop with a main singer that's so out of tune it really makes me want to not hit play again. :-)"
"Happy to find this great theme available <SEP> Happy to find this great theme available. It's a strong western flavored delight that after many listening s, still sends shivers through my bones."
"Generic Electronica <SEP> ""Cruz Del Sur"" by rvsb is a fairly generic electronica track with the required spacey club beats.  The song is not really worth listening to more than once, but I could see its appeal if you want to hit the dance floor."
What a wonderful song! <SEP> I love this song. The singers are perfect for Back Home in Derry! Irish accent and a deep voice. Just how this song should be sung!
One Star <SEP> the demo of Ave Satanas was to distorted
I love these song and I am blessed by <SEP> Although I only downloaded 2 songs. I love these song and I am blessed by them
Five Stars <SEP> Paul Wilbur is awesome! Love his Messianic music! And bonus...Danny Gokey!!
"Very Anointed Song <SEP> I plan on using it with our Ladies Praise Team, then as a Congregational worship song. Phillips Craig and Dean have a good version as well"
Two Stars <SEP> I ws so upset cuz its live and  extremely low valume
"Reminds me of the old Will Downing <SEP> Although I must admit that his last two CD's haven't been great, he hit it with this single. I didn't like the CD, but this song reminded me of how great he can be. His sensual voice, and the music sets the tone for romance. Great job Will, but you can do better."
Not worth a penny! <SEP> Disgusting song title and music.
One Star <SEP> Noise. And Indie kids want a two-state solution by the way.
"This is so soothing <SEP> I bought it twice. I play it everyday. If you are the type of music lover that you want to be, then Carmen is a ""must add,"" to your collection."
Disappointed <SEP> The music is the same as other titles by this maker. There is only a difference in what instrument they decided to have stand out. I have purchased other music from this maker and so when I heard this one I immediately noticed the similarity. I expected to hear some subliminal messages and I didn't. I also got the developing attention to detail track and I could hardly tell the difference between the two. This was wasted money for me.
music <SEP> his music is one of a kind. I would recommend to friends and family. just love it. will buy more
One Star <SEP> Peaks are greatly distorted; don't bother! Very disappointing.
Makes me feel like i'm floating on a cloud <SEP> Lovely Vivaldi piece. Makes me feel like i'm floating on a cloud.
"Watch out for the manure! <SEP> I luvs me some Southside Johnny (SJ).  I yield to no one in this regard.  But SJ has always had the benefit of high production values on his albums.  Whether it was the strings and horns on the awesome Steve Van Zandt- produced albums or the deep funk groove of his Nile Rodgers-produced masterpiece, Trash It Up album.  Doing a lo-fi roots album, might dovetail nicely with a low-budget, but it does not do his fans any favors.

SJ's contemporary and friend Bruce Springsteen may have gotten away with some roots albums, but, Johnny, you *dont* ""wear it well"" (and the jury is still out whether Bruce got away with it either).

SJ's voice is very raggedy, but very VERY few have a raggedy voice in that ""good way"".  Johnny is not blessed to be one of those very few.  And the ""croaking"" in his voice would have me worried whether seeing him live he can still belt out a believable ""Love on the Wrong Side of Town"".  And by all means, if this is the first time your hearing ""Something You Got"" or ""I Can Tell"", please do yourself a favor and at least go back to the Them and Dr. Feel-Good versions, if not all the way back to the originals.  SJ's versions will put you off them forever.

Southside Johnny ... without the soul.  Who thought this was a good idea?"
"Another AWESOME ministry experience! <SEP> In this present moment, this song is speaking to my heart greatly! I don't believe a worshipper can make a wrong choice by listening to Paul Wilbur. This song and CD proves it..."
Five Stars <SEP> a good less well known tune if u like luke bryan
This must have been a mistake. <SEP> I don't remember ordering this and I  don't like it.  It's not my kind of music. Sorry about this order.
Five Stars <SEP> Moving
"I want to be like a child again and to dance in the rain! <SEP> Do you remember being a kid and wanting to go out and play in the rain!?  I remember being that child!  This song has a great rhythm and fun lyrics that make you want to be that child again and dance without abandon.  Just this past week, while on vacation, my best friend reminded me that if we got rain where we were, that we could go out in it anyway, that rain in simply liquid Sonshine!  Priase God for Christian Bronner reminding us that rain is fun if we let it be so.  Let the rain fall indeed ... and then get out there an dance in that liquid Sonshine!"
awesome! <SEP> Always loved everclear  and still listen all the time! would tell anyone not familiar with everclear tio check them out
Five Stars <SEP> Kawika has an angels voice.
I love this! <SEP> I love Vince Gill but I've never heard of Elizabeth South.  She has great vocals and her voice blends well with Vince's.  A+ song.  :-)
"Four Stars <SEP> I liked this one, he sings the faster ones and the ballads better"
"Half a song! <SEP> The song doesn't start from the beginning, I had to purchase it from the G****** store, would appreciate if I could be refunded."
"Art vs. quality is akin to a gold ring in the snout of a pig. <SEP> It's a travesty to hear what the loudness war is doing to fine art.  This recording suffers from over-compression, lack of transients and severe distortion.  If I wanted all that, --I'd listen to it on the radio.  Art vs. quality is akin to a gold ring in the snout of a pig. Headroom Injury - overcompressed."
"Audience coughing in background of music <SEP> I first heard this piece on Youtube, and was annoyed by the coughing and noise in the background since this was recorded at a live concert. I purchased the track in the hopes it was recorded in a studio or a concert hall which lacked an audience so that an unblemished version was available for download. No such luck.

I believe this is one of the more beautiful versions of Moonlight Sonata, but the audience removes from the mood. George Cherkin, I love what you did with this song, but the live audience ruined it."
"If you want the whole song, don't waste your money!!! <SEP> It was the version of unpretty that I wanted however the DJ cut off the beginning and the end. I was so very disappointed. The sample that is on amazon is very deceiving. You think that you are getting the version that you want and are getting the entire song but you are not."
nice song <SEP> its a nice song lol. little sis cant stop singing it. its halarious. and she dances to it... lol. just lol.
Deception <SEP> An abbreviated version of the song. It wasn't worth wasting the time to buy something I didn't want. I wish I was given the entire song.
inspirational <SEP> i'm a big beckah shae fan so of course i love all her music but this particular song is awesome.
"Rare CD Version Of Debut Album. <SEP> Malcolm and Alwyn introduced themselves to the UK Gospel scene via this 1973 album and subsequent concerts etc.
At that time UK Christian only had Cliff Richard, Parchment and a few others.
These are the songs:
1. Say It Like It Is.
2. Fool's Wisdom.
3. Tomorrow's News.
4. Growing Old.
5. Things Are Getting Better.
6. Heaven Or Hell.
7. Seed Of Corn.
8. The World Needs Jesus.
9. Always On My Mind.
10. It's Here The Answer Lies.
The musical approach is Folk/Pop, but don't be fooled, there's some serious stuff to be heard including Growing Old and especially Heaven Or Hell.
My top choice is another challenging track, The World Needs Jesus.
This may be rare, however it's got my full recommendation."
"Yes, because it's cool... <SEP> Genre snobs be damned, Mousse T. can be relied upon for the tracks that get feet tapping, hips swaying, and people asking 'What's this you're playing?'  They say the talented ones make it all seem easy, and I guess that means Mousse T. is a fair sight more than skilled, because where his last album was a soulful, jazzy affair, this one is a piece of pop/rock candy, effortlessy spun out as if you already knew the songs.  And like all good pop/rock, it's somewhat twee, but it's also got all the elements of that record you played all summer long when you were a kid.  In short, this is one of the year's guilty pleasures not to be missed, and worth every penny."
Five Stars <SEP> thanks!
Five Stars <SEP> love this song
"Five Stars <SEP> Thank you, Avengers. This one's for you."
"Watts hymns nicely sung <SEP> Hymns of Isaac Watts some familiar, some not.  I like the opportunity to listen to new hymns and nicely sung.  I would buy other collections by this group."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent service and product!
"I am actually pretty shocked he could come up with such a mediocre ... <SEP> Mehh, and I am a big Johnny Marr fan.  I am actually pretty shocked he could come up with such a mediocre album.  Obviously better as a collaborator, which is just fine.  This is not close to inspirational, now his work in the Smiths and Electronic, that is phenomenal, ....this  retread rhythm lines and poor lyrics and the voice fine for backup but not lead."
"A fine album; a terrible digital release: BUYER BEWARE! <SEP> The album is great, no question about that. However, this version is a disgrace. First, it is sourced from vinyl. Second, some songs are at different speeds than on the original record. Finally,it is ""no-noised"" to eliminate the (normal) hiss you would expect from a decades-old recording. I compared it to a cassette I made from the original MCA album in 1982. The cassette, which has 30+ years of audiotape degradation, is a superior listen.

Why is this released to an unsuspecting audience (which, admittedly is about 100 fans from around Boston)? Look at who released it: RDEG. Curious name. Research shows that RDEG is owned by the same person that owned Renaissance Recordings, which went bankrupt in 2010. RR was well-known for the low quality of its releases, releasing poor masterings of dubious provenance. It was never clear that they owned the rights to the music. No mastering information available."
"cute song with neat words <SEP> I rarely ever buy a song for the words, but I identified with this song, as I drink caffeine, and this song is kind of celebrating caffeine.  Don't expect a super song, but Emmylou and Rodney do a good job with it."
"Two Stars <SEP> lousy harm
ony"
Two traditional Americana muisc headliners stand out... <SEP> This is a super collaboration by two of Americas best songwriters and performers. This particular selection deals with the proverbial problem of addiction an always popular song theme. The two are fantastic together.
"Spanish Dancer <SEP> Love everything about this song! The lyrics, the music, the harmonies... really touch my soul. So much meaning and emotion expressed so beautifully!"
"Bubble Buster <SEP> Not sharing in the same thought as the 5 star reviewer, i find this particular Defected In The House Miami 2013 to be Lame!! Defected in the House do Put out great house music MP3's however get the DIH with the well known artists like Miguel Migs, Kerri Chandler, & Others Known to True House Heads!! Sorry To Bust Your Bubble 5 Star Reviewer, U Don't Know What The Hell Your Talking About! Out of 44 Tracks On this Album 4 Tops!!! Given It 1 more, just for the hell of it!! Save Your Money & Buy Masters At Work.. You Can't Go Wrong With Them..."
"A fine album; a terrible digital release: BUYER BEWARE! <SEP> The album is good, no question about that. However, this version is a disgrace. First, it is sourced from vinyl. Second, it is ""no-noised"" to eliminate the (normal) hiss you would expect from a decades-old recording. It is impossible to listen to.  When compared to a cassette tape I made of it in 1982, it loses on every count.

Renaissance Recordings (conveniently having gone bankrupt and now incarnated as RDEG) was well-known for the low quality of its releases: poor masterings of dubious provenance. It was never clear that they owned the rights to the music, nor was mastering information available. Renaissance Recordings and RDEG have one thing in common: a contempt for the listening public.

Do not buy this release. Buy an old vinyl copy, clean it carefully, and using free audio tools, rip it to your computer. It will sound better than this dreck."
"Good music <SEP> This song is part of the brilliant soundtrack for the movie ""Stoker.""  The film had plenty of good songs, most of them covers of old standards, but the two by Emily Wells are the best."
"Untitled but not Unmoving <SEP> J'ai adore! I love this song. Has a slower melody and softer beat than any of his other songs, which means nothing of course! Cause everything he does is all awesome! Rumbling voice paired with haunting music. Buy it, it's great!"
'Tiny Artows' is dandy...but... <SEP> Tiny Arrows is a splendid  example of how well Natalie Merchant's boice blends with the band'performance.  I prefer 'Like the Weather' and 'Carnival.'
"FANTASTIC <SEP> SERIOUSLY, seriously love this song. His raw voice combined the blues type setting with the strumming guitar is just pure magic. When I listen to it, I can picture myself in a smoky bar while listening to an acoustic version of this song. LOVE."
"Indie with a blues tint <SEP> Easy going beat, excellent vocal, not what you'd expect from a pretty face like Matt.  A very tight backing band."
"Soothing tone, fantastic voice <SEP> I LOVE Matt Corby!! Anything I've heard of his is always great! He has a very soulful voice, which with this soothing melody and light tone is just great to listen to. Also features a young girl singing with him as well. Her clear tone with his raw voice is just pure genius. I liked it. Great song!"
"wawanolet is not Abenaki, and awful singing and drumming <SEP> I cannot even speak to how much this is a very dishonorable song to our Great Chief greylock, who is/Was Waranoake, NOT ever Abenaki.  For too long I have heard the fakes, the lies and the wanna bees create their own chif who has faught in honor for his and other peoples. greylock Wars/also known as Dummer's Wars.  Wawanolet, a phonetically written name for Abnaki , meaning ""One who fools others"".  The Drumming is horrendous, as it is off key and rhythm with the heartbeat of mother earth. The tune seems to be very similiar to one of Wilma Mankiller's songs, as well, the singing is a joke. The annunciation of an attempt of even singing Abenaki has failed, off key with the drum beat, and just all out flat tuned.  I had made the mistake of playing this sample to those who still speak versions of the Abenaki dialects still alive, as well to those who do not speak or understand any algonquian languages.... it is a concenses this is not a product worth purchasing or listening to for the second time.  It is a dishonor to our Chif, and pray this song is removed from existance.  Ohnaumanee a Manitioux and may those who drum know their rhythm with mother, otherwise, one cannot be as one with mother.  Nolka"
"This song is a blast to listen to over and over <SEP> Ever since I first heard this song I have been unable to stop listening to it. Foggy and the Clubmix are the best combo I've heard yet, the voice is beautiful and the techno, trance, reverb, bass, etc just keeps on flowing."
Not interesting. <SEP> Just keep running.
Four Stars <SEP> Great Item. No complaints.
Five Stars <SEP> Fierce
"A good cover of a good song by a good artist <SEP> After hearing it on YouTube for the umpteenth time, I figured I might as well step up to the plate and actually buy the song. This was an excellent choice for a cover, and anyone who enjoy's Tay's booming voice won't be disappointed by his his performance here."
"YES <SEP> Ugh, that last song. What a chilling moment of orchestration. Overall a delightful score to a perfect movie. Seriously. Sunset Boulevard is the best."
Trying <SEP> Trying
"Big Disappointment <SEP> I had ordered this for my dad and he was so looking forward to it. When he played it, it was some kind of really bad rock and roll band. It stunk!"
Great song <SEP> I needed a song to play along with my Alaska trip slides. This song worked perfectly for me. thank you.
"Really, really good <SEP> Great audio quality. Alison Krauss is wonderful also"
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful harmony and instrumentation.  A lovely song.
"These Guys Rock <SEP> If you like pop punk, and have never listened to these guys, give them a whirl.  I'm a huge fan and these guys never fail.  Rev Norb's lyrics are hysterical and the music rocks.  I was lucky enough to catch them back in 1996 with the Riverdales and The Mr. T. Experience and they were highly entertaining.  Probably one of the best live bands I've seen just from an entertainment perspective.  Seriously fun band with really catchy tunes....  Much rawkage."
Sad <SEP> This song cuts off at the end. There is more too it. Would like the full version hope amazon can help
Not a good recording at all <SEP> Only half the album is Cole.  This appears to be some sort of compilation of 78 rpm records poorly recorded and put through some sort of bad stereo expansion process. The artwork is worth having...might as well throw away the record.  It's not really listenable.
"Five Stars <SEP> Great collection of Sun Records hits - Great Balls of Fire, Blue Suede Shoes, Whole Lotta Shakin'!"
"Everyman's initial spectacular success remains a great mystery <SEP> Dutton Records has played a major role in the revival and recording of less familiar British romantic and modern repertoire and produced several invaluable recordings. Yet it is hard to avoid, when being as adventurous as they are, that some projects will fail. Henry Walford Davies (1869-1941) was best known in his day  at least in the latter part of his career  a very popular radio broadcaster, but he was also an important teacher and organist. He was also a relatively prolific composer, with two symphonies, plenty of chamber music and a long series of large-scale choral-and-orchestral works to his name. His ambitious cantata Everyman for soloists, chorus and orchestra, completed in 1904 and based on the 15th-century morality play, was his greatest success; indeed, it was quite spectacularly successful and it is no wonder that a record company specializing in British music would look into it.

Praised by Stanford and Vaughan Williams its initial success remains a mystery. The play itself is a pretty serious affair, but Daviess treatment is at least variegated, opulent and very Victorian  not really suited to the text, but that is probably of minor concern. Stylistically it is reminiscent of the early Elgar oratorios and Parry, with some more Brahms and Schumann thrown in, but it is utterly devoid of anything memorable  perhaps apart from the somewhat rousing conclusion, which cannot to any extent make up for the endless, heavy-handed and usually boring music that has gone before. It is surely very sincere, but the tunes are dreary and predictable, there is no dramatic tension, and even the scoring lacks elegance and lightness of touch; the impression  unfair, to be sure  is of an amateur trying to copy Elgar.

It isn't help by the performances. Now, the London Oriana Choir does a fine job, and the Kensington Symphony Orchestra occasionally manages to create the illusion of being a world-class ensemble, though David Drummond seems to be sometimes unsure where on Earth the music is headed  surely not his fault: it isn't headed anywhere but meandering aimlessly around its point of departure. But the soloists are  how shall I put this  rather wobbly. Extremely wobbly, in fact. The male singers are the worst offenders: Pauls Putnins as Everyman sounds like he is far past his prime (which he isnt) and is often hard to listen to; yet he is better than Andrew Staples as Death, whose singing is very often utterly unlistenable  which is surprising, since Staples has made a number of very well-received recordings. I dare you, though, to listen to e.g. track 5, I am Death that No Man Feareth without wincing. Perhaps the problem is mostly that Daviess writing for voices is unidiomatic. Whatever. I have no complaints about the recorded sound but it doesnt really matter. Perhaps this release will have some appeal to historians of British music; the rest of us may safely pass it by."
Five Stars <SEP> hardcore at its best
One Star <SEP> This is not Steve Gaines from Lynyrd Skynyrd. Be warned
Four Stars <SEP> Great music.  Great group.
"Initially, the sampled human voice was an amusing novelty ... <SEP> Initially, the sampled human voice was an amusing novelty in modern recording. In 2015, it's just plain redundant. And the sampled ""oooooh's"" are simply abundant and redundant on this recording. I don't care for it."
Five Stars <SEP> Great going to sleep music.
"Lamaze by Geneva Jacuzzi <SEP> From what I knew of Geneva Jacuzzi before I was sure that this cd would be amazing .  I was happy to find Geneva mixing old vibes to help her create her unique sounds in painstaking detail . I love that I thought for a minute that I had found vintage GOLD but it still had such a post modernism feel . Through the cd I found tracks with a tropicalia vibe , her almost new wave synth drenched experimental tracks ,  and the interesting electrogoth lo-fi tracks she creates so effortlessly . Right from the opening track ''cloths on the bed'' to the last '' zombie shark '' my attention was fully kept . This is a perfect cd if you like almost all of the artist signed to Human Ear Music such as Ariel Pink . Her music is for a lot of people and im sure almost everyone could find something they liked hidden on Lamaze .

I will just say this , I am very happy with my purchase of Lamaze and I would buy it again . Another thing that I want to say is Geneva i'll be happy when the next cd comes out. So I hope this is helpful if your a little unsure of whether or not you should buy this cd and I hope you do .

  Sierra"
Not expected <SEP> It was not at all what I expected or wanted.  I thought I was getting something else entirely.  Buyer beware.
"ONE HECK OF A FUN SONG <SEP> I LOVE THE MAVERICS SO I AM PARTIAL TO THEIR MUSIC.
I BELIEVE THEY WERE GREAT IN 90'S BUT WITH EDDIE REREZ AND THIS NEW COME BACK,THEIR IN A LEAGUE OFF THEIR OWN .
THIS IS ONE OFF 9 GREAT SONGS OUT OFF THIS ALBUM ""IN TIME""
GO MAVERICKS"
Five Stars <SEP> Soft jazz at its best
"Epic melody, powerful voice, and nice music! <SEP> Epic melody, amazing voice, and nice music!
I just found some issues with the lyrics after multiple times listening to it!"
Five Stars <SEP> You won't walk away either if you just listen
One Star <SEP> Songs not downloaded to my music library
Five Stars <SEP> Sad but haunting!  This song hooks you and you simply must listen again and again!
"Best of class <SEP> This is my candidate for ""best song"" on the album.
Deceptively simple, it will lift up your emotions. Turn up the volume and savor the guitar. This is a fabulous song you will play again and again."
"Like it <SEP> Just got it, listening to it now and about 7 songs in and I have to go ahead and say I like it a lot, I'm glad I found it . Sounds a little like lumineers, Decemberists, Head and Heart, mumford n' sons ect. Feel Good, Up Beat and Pretty damn good."
Fun & Upbeat <SEP> My kids and I like this CD.  Yancy is fun and has great messages to her fun music.  We like it!
"I just didn't like it. Too much guitar <SEP> disappointing, sorry, I just didn't like it. Too much guitar, too much singing. I am a fiddler and was hoping for a great deal of fiddling and it just wasn't very good. Sorry I couldn't tell you more. If you are into fiddling check out Brittany Haas' album , the one with old time fiddling, that is my favorite. This had too much guitar picking and singing  for my tastes."
Pretty much like all his songs <SEP> Very well done by Tyler! He just has the musical touch that a singer/song writer has. Pretty much like all his songs.
"This is one of my favorite albums and it will be for some time <SEP> This is one of my favorite albums and it will be for some time. Seriously, if you end up buying this and don't like it, you're wrong. Keep making music guys, it's great and I thank you for it!"
"its okay <SEP> thought that this verson was a little different than the original verson. if it is the original verson then i guess its okay, i just thought that the singers voice was different and was actually country instead of trying to be country"
I didn't enjoy this song <SEP> this song was not as good as the original. This remake just wasn't good. I can listen to it but sometimes it just sucks sorry but it does.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful musically and I love the soul
Heavenward <SEP> Love this CD.  Very spiritual an soothing to the soul.  Can play it anytime to lift the heart heavenward.  Great job Courtney!
I love it <SEP> I love the new album....a nice mix of songs. Some old and some new. Hope to catch him in concert sometime soon....
"Only two songs... <SEP> It only contains two (2) songs on it, with normal and off-vocal versions of them... Definitely not worth the price I paid. The product description should at least say what the customers are paying for."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"not as represented <SEP> It was listed as like new condition but it wasn't. The jacket was ok but the record plays with much static, as in much used and dirty."
"Only contains 2 tracks <SEP> The Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch Wizard's Edition Special Music Selection CD has only two tracks. Thus, I have submitted a grade of 1/5 as a rating of value. Right now, 3rd party sellers are trying to sell this for as high as 60 U.S. dollars.

I'm also submitting this review to inform those fans who might try to buy this CD anyway because of the limited availability of the version within which this CD was included. This CD came with the North American version of the Ni No Kuni limited edition release, known as ""Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Wizard's Edition"".

The two tracks on this release are:

1) Ni no Kuni Main Theme (length: 3:38)
2) Kokoro no Kakera (length 4:12)

Both of the tracks described above will be available in the full 2 CD soundtrack release that is being made available exclusively from Wayo Records. Track 2 of this Special Music Selection CD will be available in both English and Japanese versions in the 2 CD soundtrack release from Wayo Records. Search the internet for ""Wayo Records ni no kuni"" to find where to order the soundtrack from Wayo Records directly.

I make mention of the purchasing information because Amazon isn't carrying the official soundtrack directly, though a 3rd party through Amazon might be ready and willing to sell it to you for a ridiculous markup price.

If you need to see proof of the soundtrack going up for sale from an official source, please see Level 5's website for the announcement. I'll post a link in a follow-up comment to this review."
Mediaeval Baebes Live <SEP> This is not the Mediaeval Baebes Live album.  Is missing 9 of the songs from the live album. and some of the songs are not on the live album.
A must have for fans that are missing this in their collections. <SEP> Never disappointing. All but three tracks get a five star rating still making this one really enjoyable album. I would recommend something else to someone new but again find this to be a near perfect release.
"Best Nick Cave Album <SEP> An amazing album, now my favorite Nick Cave record. Jubilee Street and Push The Sky Away are the standouts."
"I am a preschool teacher and the kids rock out ... <SEP> I am a preschool teacher and the kids rock out to the first 2 songs on this album! You should hear them sing! Parents ask me for more info often, I'll send them to Amazon!"
"TV EPISODE <SEP> Heard this at the end of an episode on TV  (The Bridge).  It was a haunting, dark, soulful, song.  Loved IT!"
Piano ooh la la! <SEP> I'm a new fan of this young man's style...thoroughly enjoyed it.  Easy listening and I will continue to listen.  Makes me wish he could sit and play at my piano!  Keep making and writing music!!
Five Stars <SEP> great!
Love this song <SEP> I absolutely love this song.  I play it in my massage practice every day.  I never get tired of it.
"My kids' favorite cd <SEP> Ever since we bought this cd after seeing a mr. Palindrome in concert (a real treat), we have been listening to this cd. In particular my 3.5 year old and 20 month old love, shiny face sticker and backwards alphabet.  It is educational and my husband and I will have a new trick to trot out at parties, singing the alphabet backwards really fast!  I highly recommend for toddlers to school children. We also like Alove alliteration. I like the educational value combined with catchy tunes. Highly recommend."
"FEH! <SEP> Pretty much your standard New Age drivel: Noodling pointless music, trendy song titles, all lacking any real intensity or purpose. Skip this one."
The bulk of these songs are jacked up <SEP> The bulk of these songs seem to be performed by an imposter. The majority of them aren't what you'd expect to hear; they're not always the radio edition.
"Right songs, Wrong singers <SEP> My bad I guess... I didn't read the reviews. Hopefully you read this before you buy and make a wiser choice than I did. The singers aren't bad but they aren't right either... Very disappointed."
TOP 40 CHART HITS <SEP> I wanted a 2013 top 40 hits on a CD not Cloud or MP3. The songs are too teeny boppish. I only like about 4 songs out of 40.
"NOT BY THE REAL ARTIST <SEP> It's my first time doing a review. Most of the songs are not sung by the real artist. I purchased this Top 40 Chart thinking it would be the real tracks. But No, it's all instrumentals with other artists' vocals."
"Got live if you want it! <SEP> Recently caught their StageIt show from Daryl's House Club and was reminded their live recordings are great. Will take a few more listens to be sure, but I think ""Joe Dirt Car"" is better overall. Hope to see them in person someday."
"This is a great tune, wish I would have found it earlier <SEP> This is a great tune, wish I would have found it earlier. If it has the Hoss singing a tune, it gots ta be good."
The Tune Reaches Me <SEP> The music is evocative and soul-stirring.  The men's voices blend well and their musicianship summons up a deep emotional response for whoever is listening.
"Song by Song breakdown <SEP> I am writing this as I listen to the entire album the whole way through. After I listen to each song I will write about them, and when I finished listening to the album I will rate each song. I am also assuming you know what this album is (more of a club remix album than a straight remix album). You should already be familiar with My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, otherwise start with The Beast of TKK to get a good sampler of what the band has to offer.

1. Sex on Wheelz (Astro & Glyde's Summer Solstice Mix): This is a great remix with nice builds and a catchy, sleazy groove. They mess with the sampled guitars and add their own layer. I don't really think this is a danceable song, but definitely intricate and enjoyable. 7/10

2. Leathersex (Paul Lancaster's Wipe Clean Mix): I was not impressed with this song. The drums (which are totally outside of the realm of TKK) do the same thing the entire song. The bass does the same thing as well. I am not familiar with Paul Lancaster's work, but this song sounds like it was created by an 11 year old who got his hands on a trail version of Sonic Foundry Acid. 2/10 (For effort! Keep at it though Paul....someday you'll make something people will enjoy).

3. And This Is What the Devil Does (This Is What Ebon Does Mix): This song is just an awesome take on ATIWTDD. I am familiar with Ebon's sound and they did a great job of remixing in their style without ruining the integrity of the original song. They use the samples in an intelligent and clever way. The fat, round basses sound arpeggiated, but it is by no means repetitive. Overall great listen. 10/10

4. A Daisy Chain 4 Satan (P's White Rabbit Re-Dub): Well, you can't get tired of ""I'm the white rabbit."" This song has little trace of A Daisy Chain 4 Satan aside from the use of the all too familiar samples. Groovie's lyrics are completely absent except for the first couple seconds of the song. At some points I feel like I am listening to the ""Commander Keen""(A children's video game from the early 90s) soundtrack. I don't know what to make of this song really. I wouldn't play this in my club...ever. 4/10

5. Waiting for Mommy (Bryan Zentz' Dealin' With the Devil Mix): The original version of this song is pretty groovy, and I'm glad Bryan Zentz did a great job of keeping it groovy and then some. Only the samples are used in this song, but that is totally alright as this is a club remix. The samples are used intelligently and fit nicely. The bass is bumping, very dynamic, and gets a solo here and there. This song is totally danceable and I would play it in my club if I wanted two chics to grind on each leg. 8/10

6. Disko Fleshpot (Phunk Investigation's Club Mix): More thumpin bass and a House music-like way of using samples. The Bomb Gang Girls made this song sexy, and this club remix suits a club full of sexy girls looking to get their skank on. However, like most of this club type of music that most TKK fans despise, there are those repetitive techno/house drums with familiar hi-hats, and other elements of techno that don't really speak to rivetheads. 6/10

7. Radio Silicon (Freakus' for Laura-Lorenza & Guajo Mix): Dark and evil -- just the way we like it. Cool riffs, samples are classic, and I hear voices over the radio from the devil. Could easily go over well in a dark club setting. 9/10

8. Kooler Than Jesus (Tommie Sunshine & Mark Verbos Mix): More sample manipulation. At times it feels like the original with just a different bass dubbed over. The only reason why it sounds good is because it hardly deviates from the original. There is a sound gating effect on one sample that just doesn't sound right, but you know what Tommie Sunshine & Mark Verbos were trying to do. This gets scored down mainly because the bass dubbed over is boring. 7/10

9. Days of Swine & Roses (D: Fuse & Hiratzka Mix): Dark and evil -- you know that's they way I like it. Includes builds, cool solos, and sweet sounding synths. The drums are mixed with other cool noises and the samples are utilized well. I remember listening to the 30 second sample and not feeling too impressed, but this was a pleasantly fun track to listen to. Spin this at your club if you want a sexy goth vampire chic to grind on either of your legs. 9/10

10. Asylum Disciple (Blue Room Project's Straightjacket Mix): The song opens with ""I Feeeeelllllll a diissscccoonnneeccttiionn."" I don't think I have to say anymore about this slow, mainly boring remix. Spin this at your club if you want a fat girl grinding your leg. 3/10

11. Badlife (Kemek the Dope Computer Mix): Listen to the 30 second sample. It doesn't change much from that besides a few wacky change-of-pace solos. 3/10

12. Cuz It's Hot (Nee & Shreve Mix): Nee and Shreve have done some cool stuff with the lyrics, but the basses are just soooo repetitive. The drums are F'in awesome sounding though and that extra ""kult"" after ""thrill kill k-k-k-k-kult"" sounds really cool. Very creative despite the lack of dynamics in the music. If you were to spin this at your club, you might get a sexy girl on your leg. 8/10

13. Dimentia 66 (Grayarea's Loaded on Lincoln Mix): They turned it into a soft, beautiful song!?! Real guitars! Oh no! It sounds like Dimentia 66 as a Radiohead song. That is the only way to decribe it. This isn't something you could dance to. If you spin this in your club, people would probably leave. It is interesting to hear a song like this structured like and played as a rock song. 7/10 (Because it is a great song, but....this isn't the industrial I came to hear)

I am very unimpressed with this album. It has its highs and my god it has some pathetic lows. If you can download the songs individually, download only the 8/10+ tracks. It blows my mind that this is even labeled a tribute album, because some of these artists missed the mark by far. I have doubts as to whether they are actually familiar with TKK's work or if they are just looking for a quick shot at their name on another album. Ebon did his job, but should have filtered out the junk and found more worthy remixers. The people that would play this album at their clubs are people that would otherwise never listen to My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. I own this because I am a completist. If you are a super rad techno-fan-boy who thinks Fruity Loops is super cool then this album is for you. If you are a fan of Chicago industrial, just stick with TKK's own albums."
"it's about time someone remixed a TKK song... <SEP> ...(i'm kidding, of course)

Bullet points!

1: Production value sucks. Cheap sounding effects, vocals and sampling on a lot of tracks.

2. Crummy programing. Very basic run of the mill, nothing you haven't heard before.

3. Very little thought put into the mixes.

EXCEPT FOR:

""Leathersex"" - very good mix. Borderline electroclash.

""Dementia 66"" - BRILLIANT mix! Very different, nice interpretation.

I am really impressed with this one!!!

In fact I only wrote this review to praise Grayarea on thier mix!

These two tracks are what this project SHOULD have been about!

"Leaves a lot to be desired... <SEP> Being a long time fan of MLWTTKK, I immediately pre-ordered this tribute/remix collection. Upon hearing the first few moments of this CD, it was blatantly clear that whoever remixed these Kult classics had little regard for the originals' lustre. The mixes are light, airy.... pure fluff. Don't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that TKK has delivered to its fans for many a year. The mixes butchered the originals to the point that it's not even novel, just cotton candy filler. How TKK allowed this malformed release is beyond me. The only purpose I see that this ""tribute"" could serve is to introduce TKK to a young lightweight, whose ears are not used to original industrial epics. Either that, or only for the hardcore TKK fan who just wants to have every release. The dust on my copy is already accumulating, and probably will for some time. If you're looking to dip your toes into My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, don't buy this CD. Stick with the new greatest hits release, or better yet, start with any release prior to ""Hit & Run Holiday""."
"Grass Roots 1st <SEP> I think it is a great compilation of songs,some originals,some covers. Just the right amount of production. I really like the cover of Paul Simons I Am A Rock. Sound quality is very good, maybe not quite up to the original vinyl lp in stereo(which I believe sounds superior to the mono on this lp) Original lp is not that easy to find in nice shape these days. May have sold a few more copies if it had come out with catchier front cover artwork. I like it as much as their 2nd lp. Both are 60's classics."
One Star <SEP> not the original singers or group.
Good recording .. great for civic activities <SEP> good quality recording .. used it recently to play it at an activity along with the Star Spangled Banner and it was very nice and clear.
"Haha! <SEP> I am in the same boat as the other reviewer that doesn't remember purchasing this!  Maybe it was some free download or something?!  Either way, it's not worth paying for!  It seems some people like it, and I guess it's a decent effort at a song, but it's definitely not my taste in music."
One Star <SEP> Record was dirty with crusty stuff on it. Along with white scuff marks.
"The 2nd star is a gratuity <SEP> I've never made a record before. The work that goes into it is a mystery to me. I only know what my ears tell me. This is very forgettable music. It tries to be both melodic and fierce and fails masterfully at both. It's really worse than saying that it's altogether awful because it's just forgettable in every note. The vocals are weak and made worse by the overuse of cheesy gang shouts and the occasional faux growler  The final track ""Until The End"" has a nice crunchy beginning that lasts all of 8 seconds before they return to the every-song-sounds-exactly-the-same mode, earnest wail/gang shout/growl formula. I couldn't wait to hit the forward button to make the shrill vocals stop."
"Chillax to the Ocean Blue <SEP> Are you looking for the musically equivalent experience of floating down a lazy river on a warm summers day?  How about taking a deep dive into a cool pool and then letting the bubbles you're splash has created lift you gently, slowly back up to the surface?  Or maybe pouring out a soda or beer into a big open glass and putting your face down close to the lip of the glass and closing your eyes and listening to the fizzle of the bubbles popping and feeling the tickle as they splash like so many miniature fireworks on your chin and cheek, tickling softly as you smile?  This is what listening to The Ocean Blues newest album, Ultramine, is like.  These languid deep bass bubble meditations don't fail to soothe and relax.  The gentle lullaby melodies with the bouncy jangle guitar rhythms, the relaxed lyrical lines and singing, and the steady structured beats coalesce into peaceful whirlpools that allow for smiles and sighing aaaahhs as arms drift out from the body.  All of the songs are very good and are very similar to their first album though there is much more of a maturity to this release and less distinctions between these songs, with the brighter and poppy and fun A Rose Is A Rose being the big exception.  I really like it and will go back to this mood music when I want to slow down and smile.  4.5 stars."
"Shoot the Deputy - not the Sheriff! <SEP> Look, it's always bonus points whenever one spots Kna in his cowboy-hat - yee-hah! Just have a look at the bugger! The man had mojo. From what I've been told, he was more of a Colt man than Remington. Sadly, this is not one of his landmark recordings.

Kna was no stranger to the NDR Orchestra. Their joint Bruckner Third from the early Sixties is a scorcher. Good as it is, this recording of the Emperor (1960) is not in the same class. There are few complaints on the orchestral side: the team delivers as expected. Scholar-pianist Paul Badura-Skoda is not a barnstorming virtuoso; hopefully there's not a performance of Schumann's Piano Concerto in the vaults. Here, he fails to dominate proceedings in Opus 73. In moments of conflict, the orchestra beats him up pitilessly - in retrospect, Kna should have lent his cowboy hat to him. Much the same could be said of his performance of Opus 111. Thoughtfulness and talent are no substitute for genius. For all its rectitude, this is not the Word by a wide margin.

The recording of the Emperor is restricted stereo which short-changes the cellos and double-basses of the NDR. Opus 111 comes in first class sound.

Holster your six-shooter and wait for better targets, Kna-wise."
Don't get this <SEP> Sound so low you can hardly hear iy
Two Stars <SEP> His first two were much better.
"Seriously... What? <SEP> I am so confused. I don't understand this. This album is a mix of great songs but they all sound like they were recorded by a crappy suburban cover band on a digital 8-track. While not terrible, I am baffled why one would choose this over the originals. Kinda like bizarr-o kid's bop. WTF."
"Chela is awesome <SEP> Chela, the rising star from Autralia.
Check out some of her other songs:  Full Moon, Fifteen, Plastic Gun, and Guts!
And she's done some great covers as well!"
"Not What You'd Expect <SEP> Baptists are a band on Southern Lord, recorded by Kurt Ballou, and you're excused for believing you've heard this whole thing before. But that's the problem with assumptions. This unassuming group dresses up their crunchy death/crust with equal infusions of noise rock and AmRep style. More Nails than KEN Mode, but heavy as the product of those two bands would be, Baptists display a unique take on post hardcore and grinding D-beat filth. Heavy, angular, occasionally spastic, and darkly rich, Bushcraft makes for some great angry music."
"This One Creeped Me Out <SEP> I bought this, listened to it and then deleted.  This guy reminded of Dr. Frankenstein doing a mind control experiment.  I did NOT get any ASMR sensation, just a weird feeling from a failed hypnosis session.  I don't recommend it to anyone who gets easily creeped out."
Perfect!! <SEP> as entertaining as the movie! great soundtrack and the main theme song by mariah carey is great to sing along to!
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
review of fireside dance <SEP> very moving music from Oz the great and powerful.  Love waltz music and wold like to find more this whispy type lyrical music .
"Great music but horrible master sourced from a vinyl record! <SEP> Before the first note of music begins, you can hear the record noise.  And the speed is off!  Did they speed it up because they thought it would sound better?  I have several copies of the original vinyl and I hate to say how absolutely horrible this CD sounds.  I would love for more people to discover this album.  Mike Chapman did a fantastic jobs mastering it!  But you wouldn't know from this unadulterated train wreck of a master.  I can only hope that someone can make a real digital master one day sourced from the original tape(s).

The tracks on the record are a good mix that shows Shandi's talent both as a singer and songwriter.  It is an obscure slice of pre-MTV awesomeness that was largely ignored when it was released in 1980.  It's sort of an amalgam of New Wave, Rock, Pop, Punk, and Torch Music all swirled together to make one tasty treat."
Format <SEP> This appears to be an mp4 format.  Useless for my needs.
"Only one track on the CD <SEP> The CD has only one track, it's from one of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and it's a lot of fun. But for 8.98, I wanted a whole album of Bach, not just one track.

So, one star for only being a one-track disc. One more star because it's a well-done track.

But I wish I'd just bought the mp3 file instead. That would have been 99 cents."
"Confidence game <SEP> My generation is often slow to keep pace with electronic sophistication. I do not listen to great music on a telephone, nor do I stream opera. I was unaware that this disk offers a single song, and not much of one at that.  The song is lovely but I have to seek Koechlin elsewhere."
Five Stars <SEP> Love the music.
Awful quality. <SEP> Awful quality. Bass missing completely from this recording.
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
Really Nice Job ! <SEP> James Hunter gives us a different sound here. and does a really nice job !
Great CD every one will live laughs  for all ...buy it now <SEP> Saw this show live very very funny. A must buy..no matter the cost.......My daughter and I  laughed .till tears rolled down our faces.
Marvelous Voice <SEP> Nice and fresh performance of an old song. Amanda has that special quality in her voice that can make her an outstanding pop singer
"To hear Dubois <SEP> This was a great purchase. To hear him speak and say in his own words , his opinions and remembrances on matters. His wit is clear and his voice is strong, I am encouraged to purchase more historical recordings since the price is cheaper than the cost of  an archive recording."
Good song if you are into South Florida Rap <SEP> Good song if you are into South Florida Rap. A must have for anyone who keeps up with current rap hits.
"very happy satisfied with this CD <SEP> I Love this CD!!, its very Jesus Centered .Truly a delightful praise To Jesus. I would defitnety recommend . You will love every song."
BUY IT <SEP> heavy current doin heavy OLD SCHOOL = AWESOME
Good <SEP> The song is very good. a nice song when your driving. Three diff. singers put a good song together nice.
"Almost Home can bring you to Almost Tears!!! <SEP> This particular piece is not on the movie soundtrack, but it is beautiful! I have it on my Kindle and play it over and over again - it almost brings me to tears. I love it and highly recommend it."
Great collaboration!! <SEP> Love their sound together. A trio has never sounded better is what I review. enjoyed all of their music individually and the combination of them did not disappoint.
Full Of Kingly Majsety! <SEP> This is very majestic and anointed. It is a praiseful and worshipful  song!
One Star <SEP> Not explicit at all
Edited Song <SEP> It says explicit yet it's edited. FAIL
Great for the young dancer <SEP> This is a catchy song with a great message. My young dancer loves to dance along to this song on repeat!
"the payback <SEP> Isaac Hayes put out Black Moses
about same time.

James Brown is the Godfather of soul.

respect.

get the payback too."
Four Stars <SEP> Awesome song! Fast and heavy just the way I like it!
"Unimpressed <SEP> This is really, REALLY amateurish stuff.  They only excell at copying what other, better minds, have done before them."
Poor quality and not worth purchasing <SEP> It sounds as if the vocal was lifted from one track and the instrumental from another and then mixed together. Poor quality and not worth purchasing.
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song. Sounds good!
"What a Powerful and uplifting message for our time <SEP> How wonderful! and refreshing! Soldier of Love is powerful Anthem, I found myself listening to it over and over. I had a few favorite songs, for sure. The musical style really enjoyable..  These songs will  help transform and mobilize people from indifferent stupor. .we really need this music in the world. Truly inspiring! Thank you for bringing this into the world."
"Love the Music, but Problems with the CD <SEP> I like the recording and the pieces overall, but had some major technical problems with the CD itself: track 1 would stop playing after 29 seconds; my iTunes would lock up and had to be restarted, so basically the first movement of Harty's Irish Symphony was useless. I don't know if this this was/is an isolated problem, but I sure hope so."
"My college roommate had this album back in the 70's ... <SEP> My college roommate had this album back in the 70's, thought I'd never hear it again.  As totally non-PC humor as you'll ever want."
"Hippy Ti Ho (Album Version) and Jole Blon (Album Version) <SEP> The download didn't work....the codec wasn't available without a massive search on the web for the damn codec....this is the third(3rd) time Ive been unable to download a song from your site....each one has cost only $.99, BUT thats not the problem.....your pathetic site doesnt allow for a fix to any problem without a formal complaint....I don't have time for that crap....so its cheaper for me to use a different site and skip using amazon in the furture.
It's a lousy site......... good riddens!!!!!!"
"Jesus, Only Jesus <SEP> I didn't even need to hear the entire song before I was searching Amazon.com to download it. Matt Redman touches hearts in his desire to honor our Creator."
"A great band covers a great song! <SEP> Heart was the first band I ever saw in concert.  Adrenaline Mob is incredibly talented and does a wonderful job of putting their own flavor twist on this awesome classic while still remaining true to the original material.
It rocks.  Hard."
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite songs!
You Have To Have This For Your Playlist ! ! <SEP> I Had To Have This For My Playlist Because It Reminds Me That I'm NOT Alone ! !
"not the song i wanted <SEP> I heard a song playing on Pandora and wanted to download it and this is the song that came up when I said I wanted to download the one I was listening to.
I didn't know it was the wrong song and tried to listen to a sample but it wouldn't play. Not wanting to loose the track I hit the download button and I wasted a buck on this."
Revival <SEP> Love that this song calls for revival from our soul and gives Jesus all the glory!  It resonates so deeply within.
This is a beautiful song. I am enjoying listening to it often <SEP> This is a beautiful song.  I am enjoying listening to it often.
One Star <SEP> ok
"Catchy and Quirkily Hysterical <SEP> I need more songs where a background singer belts out ""leftovers"" and ""cold pizza.""  If you like Mackelmore, than you will probably enjoy this quirky song."
THIS WAS A GREAT SONG AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREE IS A GREAT PLUS I FREE STUFF IS GOOD <SEP> THIS WAS A GREAT SONG AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREE IS A GREAT PLUS I FREE STUFF IS GOOD
"Kind of a bore <SEP> Good concept behind the song, but grated on my nerves.  The hook was awkward; the lyrics seemed to be a mouth full and forced; singing parts weren't quite up to par.  Some people can sing.  Some people can rap.  Very few can do both and do it well."
since i got this song in 2004 it is how ... <SEP> since  i got this song in 2004 it is how i feel sometimes
Four Stars <SEP> Just what I wanted arrived on time.
Five Stars <SEP> great band
Awesome uplifting song <SEP> Awesome uplifting song!
Two Stars <SEP> don't like this cd
Loved All Mike's Songs <SEP> I Have All Mike's Songs and Love them all! Hope He Releases A Full Album Soon or at least some new music :)
"Love it <SEP> Definite must buy for Tegan and Sara die-hard fans and for those who spin. You won't get sick of ""Closer"" with all these mixes."
"Missing essential tracks, in my opinion <SEP> I am a longtime Comateens fan.  I saw them play live in New York, in the 1980s, and it is still among my top 10 concert experiences.  I bought (and still have) the albums Comateens, Pictures On A string, and Deal With It, on vinyl, when they were released.  SO I hope I have some credibility when I say, in my opinion - as a fan - that this is not really the best of the Comateens.

Essential Comateens tracks that are missing from this CD:
Raceway
Overseas
Cool Chick
Summer In The City  (yes it's a cover, but it's such a great cover !)
Ice Machine
Garbanzo

I wish they would release all the albums on CD.  That would solve everything."
ROMANCE <SEP> GOOD music
Best song... ever! <SEP> Algiva released this several years ago... Catchy rhythm then and still... I like the tune. Great doing ever! Must buy!
Slow. <SEP> Painfully slow arrangement. Prolonged phrasing. Pauses and silences are tedious.
Love the Lyrics <SEP> The lyrics really flow well with the music.  I keep this on my main playlist.  Sappy but upbeat!  Highly recommended.
"All his own work, remastered beautifully by Jess <SEP> I love the live CD of all the six, its almost as though he was in the room signing with you. Jess and HiddenMasters Publishing and Richard Whittaker at FX in London, have done a great job remastering the original tapes. I bought my album direct form HiddenMasters for 65."
"Most promising young talent. <SEP> Jenifer Brening is a very exceptional young talent from Bayern, Germany.  Having just turned 16 in December 2012, she has had a very exciting year pursuing her dream of making music.  In May, Jenifer was 1st Runner Up on the German television show The Winner Is, which which greatly increased her exposure on a European audience.  Since then, her exposure on Youtube has caused her international fanbase to greatly exceed her German. This EP showcases her amazing voice quite well.  I have been following her efforts since July 2012 and can enthusiastically recommend her for you listening pleasure. Her official website is[...]"
Disappointed. <SEP> Not that wonderful
"This was extremely disappointing! <SEP> I didn't like the transaction at all. I wanted this song on my IPad library with all my other music, but apparently I can only play it if I download a different app with a separate library. That doesn't work for me. I want my money back! Great song, terrible customer service."
"If you like Blake Shelton <SEP> If you like Blake Shelton, he is on this album with Ashley.  They are really good together and could be the new Dolly and Porter.  Such a fun song.
A definite buy.  Ashley is a great entertainer and she is or was one of the Pistol Annies.  She will be big."
Product was not good <SEP> Product was not good
"How Did They Get From This to Topographical Oceans? <SEP> Yes were actually pretty exciting in the period of the albums Fragile and Close To The Edge. Their live run-through of this song from the latter albums catches them in fine form. They're rocking! Makes you wonder how on earth they could not see how their fans were going to react to their next studio album, the indulgent, directionless, uninspired-sounding Tales From Topographical Oceans. While that album didn't derail Yes' career entirely, it definitely brought the brakes down hard on their momentum up to that point. All just my opinion, of course."
a must have for girls and boys in love <SEP> Perfect song for lovers! I'm so glad this was recommended as a free download! This song is raw and probably the most honest love type sing I've listened to lately.
"We love you Jenni <SEP> Love it!!!
J-16424"
"Metal all day <SEP> Real good album/ep/etc. 2 of the songs are on the album called ""Heavy Metal Music"" but 2 are only on this ep.
I only gave it four stars cause I wish it was longer of a cd but hey its only 4 songs. If you want all of jasons music in his newsted band then get the ep and cd but if your just looking for some good music then just get the full legth album."
One Star <SEP> Disgusting. Will not be spending money on your site until this filth is taken down!
get re of this <SEP> Total filth.  Have you no values?
"Horrible!! <SEP> item without box in the picture, without cards, without single cd.
Only loose cds and book.
Horrible."
One Star <SEP> too expensive
Not the one <SEP> This is not the album I wanted to listen to. Another version was made earlier.
Five Stars <SEP> great for HIIT training
Five Stars <SEP> Love!  Love!  Love!
"good song, poor sound quality <SEP> This is a great song and I once had the dvd, so I thought I would like it but the quality and sound are terrible.  First time my mp3 music from you did not sound great! So I am not sure why but glad I only wasted $1 on it."
Five Stars <SEP> Most beautiful rendition yet!! LOVE IT!!
"What is your higher self? <SEP> I tried this several times. I don't know what I was seeking when I got this. Nothing ""happened"" for me. I did not notice anything. Trying to connect with my higher self? I guess some advice would help me if anyone wants to.  Thank you."
"The sounds of math. <SEP> A very clever achievement. Math has sounds. The universe is builton math so the universe hd sound. ""The music of the spheres"" was what the ancients called it. The video is also something fun to watch."
Five Stars <SEP> Have always loved this song...Go Go of the old days
Five Stars <SEP> Hoooooottttt!!!!!
"Fine early examples of the what would become a juggernaut ... <SEP> I picked up this LP when it first hit the record store, was blown away, it was the start of a long and very enjoyable relationship with the Brothers. Fine early examples of what would become the juggernaut that carried us through decades of good times.  It's primal The 31st of February / Allman Brothers and a must for any AB fan."
"Alert, a cheap CD-R item <SEP> Hey, why this fine album has been released only as a low cost CD-R item, which costs maybe only ONE DOLLAR top, man it is a shame not being released as a proper CD.
Please, do not give us such cheap custom made products."
Five Stars <SEP> One ofy favorites
Ony the instrumental! <SEP> This isn't the song...it's instrumental only. The title should reflect that BEFORE purchase. That would have been a nice thing to know before purchasing this.
Two Stars <SEP> all the same
Gotta love it in the car <SEP> A total jam!
Nancy's Circle of Friends <SEP> Nancy's Circle of Friends is the most clever and entertaining product I have ever seen for kids and the mothers who love them.  The production value is fabulous and Nancy sings her fabulous songs like an angel.  I couldn't recommend her CDs and her beautifully illustrated book more enthusiastically!
"Beautiful Music <SEP> <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brand-New-Day/dp/B00BQ8O876/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brand New Day</a>The voice, music and production values of this disk are amazing.  Parents will appreciate the music as much -- maybe more -- than their children.  Highly recommended."
"Beautiful song, beautiful voices <SEP> Very beautiful."
"Pitch first, album second. <SEP> Very sorry if you really like this album, but the frequency of the falsetto parts wavering off key is almost unbearable.  I'm sure they are all very nice singers in their own right, but together, it's just not working.  Two stars for effort.  Two stars for don't throw an album together just to make another homage to the holiday.  Iron out blending and pitch first."
"Disappointed Holidays in Gold is available through Amazon only as ... <SEP> Disappointed Holidays in Gold is available through Amazon only as MP3 format, not CD.  It is available as a CD on he Ambassadors of Harmony website . . . should I drop my Amazon Prime?"
"Tight chorus <SEP> I am a big fan of good choirs, and this is a top notch choir with some excellent performances. My family enjoyed listening to this album at Christmastime. My only complaint is the Ambassadors of Harmony end several of the songs in the same way; the effect is powerful, but it loses its impact when you hear that same ending device over multiple tracks. This is only a minor irritance, however, because the choir is so good."
"Not very smart, I guess <SEP> Couldn't figure out how to get it to download for me. Not very smart, I guess.  :)"
"See how well it works <SEP> I have been doing photography for over 30 years, so I really do not need this. But I figured I would try one of these things out and see if it will help. Will take time to work I know. So that is about all I can really say right now."
Five Stars <SEP> Good tune no lyrics.
"A Solo Like No Other! <SEP> ""The solo set... features four pieces with Brotzmann on three different reed instruments (alto, B-flat clarinet & tenor). Solo recordings and performances by Brotz are relatively rare so this disc is a special treat. Like all Victo recordings, the sound here is excellent, clean, clear and powerful. Brotzmann makes each note count, focusing on certain phrases and even laying back for a couple more poignant sections. When Peter switches to clarinet for the second piece, his tone is completely distinctive like a voice that you recognize instantly of an old friend. Again, he often lays back and shows another side - thoughtful and contemplative at first before reaching for the stratosphere with wails, screams, effective bent notes and intense blasts. For the longest piece, ""Frames of Motion"", Brotzmann switches back to his main horn, the tenor sax. This is where he digs in and shows his immense presence. Just plain incredible! Strangely enough he dips into the standard ""I Surrender Dear"" amongst his varied, unending explorations. The final piece is relatively short yet enchanting version of Ornette's classic ""Lonely Woman"". It is a perfect way to bring this superb solo offering to a grand close.  -Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery"
Very disappointed! <SEP> The songs listed on the track list in the ad are not on the CD.  They list 14 songs on the list -  #14 being Be Unto Your Name it is not on the CD.  There are other songs on the track list that are not on the CD...they don't match.  I purchased this CD for the song Be Unto Your Name  so I am very disappointed and I would not have purchased it if it had not advertised that it was on there.
"Should have bought something else <SEP> After that song about Lecrae not being true to his Christian roots because of collaborating with non christian artists and what not. (I guess I shouldn't acknowledge my coworkers cuz they not Christian), this artist left a bad taste  in my mouth. So yea should have bought something else. Album ain't even that good. It was so-so."
"A Lot of Info <SEP> As only a few artist can do, Evangel has once again brought the Bible to Life. He digs so much deeper into the scriptures you almost have an intimidation based upon what you know. I've got most of his work both as a solo artist and with Christcentric, and many guest appearances on various projects. There are probably only a handful of artist who have the range and ability to cover the subject throughout the entire Bible the way he dose. I give him the room, the floor, the soapbox to bring forth the gospel. GREAT WORK. 5 Stars"
"Not worth time or money <SEP> All you hear is rain and wind.  Nothing more.  Not woth the time or money.

i recommend Leslie Riopel MP3,""Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis"" which is very inspiring.  If you like the movie ""The Secret"" & Esther Hicks ""Ask and It is Given"" , you will love Riopels hypnosis."
"Do NOT Purchase <SEP> This album does not contain binaural beats.  Subsequently, this causes me to doubt that it has subliminal messages either."

Beautiful Music!! <SEP> Beautiful music; Amazon Music App made it to organize the selections for our wedding and reception.
"One Star <SEP> Don't waste your money...the quality is lousy, the person's voice is annoying not relaxing."
where's the music I just purchased <SEP> I can't find music I just purchased and I'm getting mad
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!
"Brilliant and a lot of fun, as usual <SEP> I've purchased all DART programs, in two stages. I got three in the beginning, then I got the other five two weeks later - and I live in Australia, so it's a big deal. This was in the second batch, and it didn't disappoint. Just... just buy it. Really. I've never suffered buyer's regret over anything from the HPLHS - because this is what they love to do. I guess it's just a bonus that they make money from it.

That said, it's not a low-budget amateur job (or it doesn't seem so), and the acting, effects and music are all top notch. As usual.

Five out of five."
good song <SEP> i like this song i bought it from amazon because i don't like itunes. it makes me want to dance in a wiggly way.
"good bootleg, except 3 songs were produced by boc under hell interface <SEP> If you are a collecter, this is a great bootleg. however, the 3 ""disco"" tracks were produced by boards of Canada, but under their other alias hell interface. they're remixes. as far as I'm concerned, these are boards of Canada remixes."
don't buy this... <SEP> definitely NOT Boards of Canada but some crappy disco....jerks.  keep away far far away. scum scum scum that's all folks
Great bouncy pop song from a talented artist with an amazing story <SEP> I stumbled across her music through a duet that she did. I searched around and found some solo music and was very impressed.  I hope that she gets the recognition that she deserves!
"But I DO NOT LIKE THIS SERIES Of It <SEP> Got This CD,  But I DO NOT LIKE THIS SERIES Of It.  Hey;  What Can I Say:>  It Isn't What I Would LOVE To Hear;  So I Gave It To A Friend Of Mine.  CD Is TRASHY Too Me Personally...!"
Just warming up to get seriously musical next go. <SEP> Interesting preliminary work to the much preferred. second work;
"Ideal Soundtrack for Centerpiece of Human Experience <SEP> Tango Siempre
Tangled
ARC Music EUCD 2429

Fantastic, exuberant demonstration of what music can do for one's circulation. ""Tango,"" because of instrumentation more than specific song structure, this release has everything for all the body's energy centers [chakras] from head to groin.
Please, for yourself, potential listener, look for this record or this group online and listen to any sample of at least 30 seconds' duration. That is all it will take for you to become a fan, and you will be doing yourself a favor.
It is lush, poignant and gorgeous in a language all its own. What would these recordings be ideal for? Time lapse photography of Life coming back in Spring. That comes to mind first, and that is the centerpiece of human experience. Imagine a record that's an ideal soundtrack for the centerpiece of human experience. Here it is."
"Six live Scriabin sonatas from Vladimir Sofronitsky <SEP> Vladimir Sofronitsky, probably the leading performer of Alexander Scriabin, combines an awe-inspiring command of the pianos range of timbral colors with an ability to convey the musics long-range structure and what I always feel is an innate understanding of what the music means.  That last point is important because Scriabin considered his music a path towards spiritual enlightenment and not as a purely aesthetic creation.  Sofronitskys place as a Scriabin performer helps make this release from specialty label Chant du Monde particularly valuable and enjoyable.  The release compiles six different live performances made in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The sound quality varies but, for several of the tracks, it is good and doesnt detract at all from the enjoyment of the pianism.  Crowd sounds are few throughout the disc. That said, this is a disc for Scriabin fans, despite the very capable remastering work by the labels editors.  General listeners should seek out more modern recordings.

The six sonatas included here are among Scriabins most adventurous efforts.  I feel that Sofronitski is at his best when Scriabin had ventured past the brand of post romantic writing he channeled in his earlier years a.  His playing of Scriabins is later work, intensely mystical and constructed from his characteristic rapturous assemblage of symmetrical modal scales and exotic tonal effects, shows a particularly strong affinity.  Highlights found on this Chant du Monde release include Sofronitskys 10th sonata which I have thought for years was a reference recording, with its sensuous yet polyphonically-conceived whole-tone slow section.  The live 9th sonata which Sofronitsky recorded at the Moscow Conservatory I believe in 1960 has always been for me one of the peaks of Scriabin playing.  The version contained here is a different one, dating from June 1958, but still brings forth Sofronitskys utterly assured rendition, both architectural and mystical.  Sofronitskys ability to convey this musics structural dimension is for me always striking.  A particularly good example is the re-transition into the coda of the 5th sonata, with its recap of the compositions opening rumbling flurry of notes. Another highpoint here is the introduction of the second theme in the Andante of the 4th sonata, about 130 into track 2, where the falling cascade of notes is combined with the surging second theme first appearance.  Sofroniskys performance of this 4th sonata is jewel-like and utterly brilliant.

The recordings compiled here are:
3rd sonata  June 1958  some noise in the upper register, the least good sound quality on the release
4th  May 1960  one of the best sounding tracks here
5th  January 1955  pretty good sound
8th  June 1958  sounds better than the 3rd although its from the same event
9th  June 1958   some noise in certain louder passages in the treble but actually very good sound outside of those few passages
10th  Feb. 1960  decent, Ive certainly enjoyed this performance over years of owning this disc
(The three June 1958 tracks come from a recital at the Moscow Conservatory that has been released elsewhere by Denon and Vista Vera.)

So I strongly recommend this disc for Scriabin fans.  Chant du Monde also released a companion compilation of Sofronitsky live performances from the 1940s and 1950s, assembling a complete set of Op. 8 Etudes and Op. 11 Preludes from a diverse set of sources. That Preludes/Etudes disc, although it is an impressive curatorial effort, doesnt have the same consistency of quality of this Sonatas disc.  5 stars for this one, as long as you belong to its intended audience."
"Good music, but the mp3s I bought were defective. <SEP> the music and performances are good, but the digital files I downloaded from Amazon are defective, have digital skips and buzzes. Damned if I can figure out how to get Amazon to fix the problem."

"Not for everyone <SEP> Not what I expected at all.  I probably shouldn't blame the artist since taste is a personal preference.  This music is pretty ""out there""!  LOL"
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
"A Worthy Effort <SEP> I rarely pay full price for an album these days. I am happy to report this was a significant purchase and well worth the money. The songs, after two listens, are stuck in my head. Vocals are oddly miked or processed, which encourages careful listening. Lots of jangly guitar, hooks, and unexpected flourishes. Playing this for many friends."
"Unbelievable how lazy these men are! <SEP> I spent the money on this mp3 thinking I would get some insight and scholarship on this most important question in all the history of mankind, yet the most neglected question even by those who claim to Love God, ""For Whom Did Christ Die?""
These lazy men got stuck on easily explained Scriptures. Better to search youtube ""For whom did Christ die?"" and listen to two sermons by two different men with this same title....John MacArthur and Angus Stewart. Though these men are in the error of cessationism, they are right on on this matter."
"Not my favorite <SEP> Sorry Kandi! I like you, but can't stand this song. It would've gotten a ""1"" but since Marvin Sapp is on it, it deserved at  least a ""2"""
"Kandi delivered on this song <SEP> I'm a huge fan of Kandi since back in day,  when she was in the girl group Xscape. Now I watches her on The Real Housewives Of Atlanta. On the show I seen her recorded this song I stay Prayed Up and had to get it. There is no denying that this womean can't sing because she kncok this one out the park. Her vocals is on point and the song has meaning to it , which touch my soul. Kandi girl keep doing your thing and keep making those hits because we all need to be prayed up. This song will definitely be the song, I play when I wake up early in the morning to help me startof  my day  on a good note. Thank you candy and keep the good work up."
"Don't waste your money! <SEP> This one didn't phase me one bit.  Spend your money on the other Female Orgasm download Amazon.com offers for 99 cents, and you should be happy."
Five Stars <SEP> The Best!!
New Favorite Song! <SEP> I love this song by Jeremy Lister. I really wanted to wait for the whole album but could not wait. I love what I would call 'mellow' music and this fits the bill in my opinion. Can't wait to hear more from Jeremy!
"love it !! <SEP> I listen to it all the time and it does work
going to get more to really get things moving"
"CRAPPY! <SEP> umm,Anne Hathaway played fantine not this crap... not froom the movie at ALL!"
Al Hirt is fabulous but this recording is horrible ! <SEP> It's too bad the quality of this recording is not up to the quality of the performer. I actually have this song on one of my L.P.s but I wanted the Cloud Player version for my Amazon Cloud Library.  What a disappointment. Poor fidelity with lots of distortion. Definitely not up the usual high quality sound I expected.
Five Stars <SEP> Song performed beautifully in her younger days.
"This MP3 album makes Ramito sound like a chipmunk <SEP> If you compare this MP3 album with the original Ansonia label release of Ramito's CD, you will find that this MP3 version is pitched about a tone above the CD version.  This means, that for whatever reasons, the MP3 album was ""speeded-up"", and all the songs consequently are in a higher key than the original CD, and in a faster tempo.  This digital distortion is known technically as ""chipmunking"".  The only advantage I can see for purchasing the MP3 version of Ramito's album is that it is in true Stereo, while the CD release is in MONO.  It's a shame that Amazon has allowed this flawed MP3 album to go on sale."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Hillbilly Savants - Lil Shack (Independent)
Hillbilly Savants are a four-piece roots-country-blues band from Austin, Texas, led by singer-songwriter Woody Price (he also plays guitar and mandolin). The other guys, JJ Barrero (bajo sexto, vocals), Mike Roberson (bass, vocals) and Jasper Cronin (guitar, vocals) bring a wealth of experience to the band, with CVs that include touring and recording experience with various Texas legends and international artists, including Santiago Jimenez Jr. and the Tailgators, Joe Ely, Ponty Bone, Calvin Russell and RC Banks. I don't think it's an overstatement to say they represent some of the crme of the Austin roots scene.

Price has two previous albums under his belt (""Damn Near Broke"" and ""Diesel and Desire""), but ""Lil Shack"" is the band's debut, and it's a damn near irresistible concoction of Texas styles, guaranteed to fill the dancefloor, or at the very least, put a smile on your face. Price sings his songs with plenty of gnarly twang, and the band play like they thoroughly enjoying themselves throughout. That sort of unbridled enthusiasm is extremely catching, and on upbeat numbers such as ""Barrio to the Bayou"" and ""Le Petite Brigand"", don't be surprised to find yourself subconsciously jigging about. That's no bad thing, but expect some odd looks if you're listening on the bus to work at 7:30 in the morning."
"Nice recording, but it's NOT Rosemary Clooney(!) <SEP> This is clearly Dinah Shore's recording of The Anniversary Song... so, if you're looking for a Rosemary Clooney recording of it, this ain't it, folks.  Move on."
"Great Album Once Properly Introduced <SEP> This album is superb and I mean that. It's not one that you would be able to digest in one sitting, however, so give it some time and really listen to the words and the music of it. With Will now providing all their bass lines, I've noticed a lot more intricacies in the riffs and grooves. This might unsettle some fans, because it's a little more complex than you'd be used to. Give this one some time to play with you and then listen to it seriously, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. And please do yourself a favor, if you make it to one of their shows or can get it on Ebay, BUY IT ON VINYL!!! It's aesthetically pleasing, smooth, and the sympathy (acoustic) track lets you know that they're still Cartel and you love them."
"Not Typical Cartel <SEP> With how great Chroma was, I was excited to listen to this CD and rock out in the car to what I was sure to be new favorite hits.  Unfortunately, there really aren't anyyy songs on this one that are memorable, or you catch yourself wanting to listen to over and over. Nothing stands out and they all sound pretty boring =/ Usually a big fan of Cartel, have been one of my favorite bands for a while just annoying when bands throw out a CD that isn't up to par with their others."
LOOOVE THIS SONG <SEP> I love this song and it's hard to find. It was a nice surprise to find it on Amazon. iTunes doesn't even have it. Woohoo!
"Christopher, Christopher <SEP> This song is one of my all time favorites!  To me it really shows a man's perspective of love & his frustration with it.  His voice is wonderful!  And he wasn't too bad on the eyes in this video either! ;)"
Five Stars <SEP> Amazing sound quality and beat!
One Star <SEP> I thought this was Rihanna but wasn't.  Didn't use.
Not the real song <SEP> I don't know what this is.. I was looking for the one with Kanye West in it.  It doesn't even sound like Rihanna by the way.  Buy the one that actually says it's from Rihanna-
"An Also Ran Again? <SEP> One of Viennas first music publishers, Franz Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was close friends with most of the composers of the high Classical Era.  In a letter, Beethoven referred to him as my most beloved brother, and Mozart dedicated his String Quartet in D Major, KV 499 to him.  He also wrote a little music, with at least 8 operas, as many as 66 symphonies, about 57 string quartets and numerous other chamber works to his credit.  Much of that chamber music includes a flute, as does at least 25 concertos.

Published in 1795, his first D Major Concerto on the present recording is No. 24 on that list.  With an orchestral introduction that is nearly 3 minutes in length, the martial Allegro that begins the composition is an ambitiously expansive movement.  Driven by horns and booming tympani, it effectively sets up the feathery entrance of the solo flute.  Instead of creating an interactive relationship, Hoffmeister uses the symphonic backing to fill in behind the single wind instrument, deftly weaving the orchestral passages around the melodic lines, following the breath patterns and not overwhelming the delicate sound of the flute.  And it is a virtuosic display.  Demanding a high level of technique, this first movement is challenge that the flutist, Bruno Meier easily rises to meet.

Employing a gentle Alla plocca ma lento as the leisurely middle section allows the flute ample opportunity to stretch out and embellish the charming, aria-like tune.  As the horns waft overhead, the music shifts into G Minor, adding drama by the use of chromatic modulations and striking harmonies before easing back to the major key for the placid ending.  A bubbly flute introduces the festive theme for the closing Rondo Moderato.  Rapid runs and extreme changes of register mark the bravura solo work while tempo shifts, brief episodes in minor, playful syncopated flourishes and a surprising time signature change into triple meter enliven the boisterous finale.

Another spacious Allegro opens the 21st concerto, published in 1788 and also penned in D Major.  Buttressed by the horns, the orchestral intro for the first movement is nearly as extensive as the other opening allegro.  Elegant and immediately engaging, the solo wind carries the tuneful excursions through wide ranging development again without much interaction with the symphonic support.

In the dark key in D Minor, the dramatic Romanza Adagio bristles with ominous undertones as the flute fashions a remarkable contrast with the accompaniment for strings only.  Despite an interlude in the relatively brighter F Major, the heavy aura of the 2nd movement never lifts.  But the brash finale, a triple metered Rondo Allegro completely dissipates the gloom.  Brilliant virtuosity in the flute lines characterize this sparkling close to the concerto.

The 2011 recording by Naxos is terrific, well balanced with depth and excellent detail.  Bruno Meiers work on solo flute is exemplary, and the Prague Chamber Orchestra provides sturdy and sensitive support.  Although these 2 fine compositions were issued during Hoffmeisters lifetime, this disc marks their world premiere.  One of the most popular composers during the Viennese Classical period, he fell into obscurity upon his death.  While his work will never rival Beethovens, it does present a glimpse into this excellent craftsmen who became an also ran in the shadow of the master from Bonn."
"Stop whining already! <SEP> Look, I love, love, love their self titled album. One of the best, catchiest punk albums ever made, so I was eager to hear what they had in store. Sadly (no pun intended), this EP is nothing but an unabashed wallow in self pity. C'mon guys, that's cool for a while, but it gets old when you let it define you."
Frankie Lane and Rawhide <SEP> What's not to love!  This is a great song by a great singer and about a great TV show from the past!
One Star <SEP> Could not get the song to upload into the Amazon Music app. Doesn't work at all. Never again.
"Too flute oriented boring session <SEP> See above. Check out my review of ""Man Of Many Parts"" for his better Lp's. Reason this is not on CD.
Cheers

One Star <SEP> Bootleg af
"I would have given it 5 stars, if... <SEP> ...it had more Diane Birch and less Devlin. No offense to Devlin of course, but it's Diane that makes the song."
Poor sound quality :( <SEP> Great soundtrack but the soundtrack downloaded at 210 Kbps. Sound quality was really low for a paid mp3 not sure if this is bootleg. You have to literally turn your speaker all the way up to have it at normal levels. I think 256kbps is decent 320kbps is incredible whats going on Amazon?
Very Poor Quality <SEP> Terrible!  The sound is very distorted throughout the recording....It sounds as if someone took an old warped album and  recorded it on a CD....Couldn't even use it for what I had purchased it for....
"This is IT! I believe the labeling and order of these movt's is incorrect. <SEP> I find this 1952 recording the most emotional and appropriately paced. Sound is a bit rough but the things that count to me are blazing. Momentum and feeling are critical with Bruckner, at least to me they are, and Jochum delivers!"
Five Stars <SEP> Hubby loves this
Another Great CD from Michael Londra <SEP> I love Michael Londra and his music and this was a great addition to my music library.
Five Stars <SEP> great buy..
Great organ piece <SEP> Perhaps the greatest organ piece ever. Very nicely recorded.
This is not EMDR <SEP> I did not like this at all. Not at all what I expected. I found the so called music to be rather strident and stopped listening after about one and a half tracks. Regret purchasing this.
"Underwold artist goes solo.... <SEP> As a huge Underworld fan, and overall completist, I had to get this. The original version started out rather weak (kind of like ""King of Snake"", actually, which has the same problem of melding different sounds that don't always work well together), but gradually warmed up to an above average track, especially at the end. The remixes are a step up from the original. I would have liked to see Rick or Darren Price get their hands on this and do a remix, but the former was busy scoring a new Danny Boyle album that's coming out next month, so at least he has an excuse. ;)  Overall, I gave this a 4 out of 5, though it more minimalist electronica than what Underworld is more known for."
Two Stars <SEP> Wifes music
"Outstanding and entertaining <SEP> A unique, alternative genre.  Guys-gone-bad try to look up old (good) girlfriends, only to find out they're ""no longer available""!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great sound!  Very talented!
"As wonderful as the film <SEP> This is such a rich soundscape. I've only seen the film once so the music more or less lives on its own, but it's a compliment to the composer that it does."
One Star <SEP> blah
"i bought this for a friend of mine. He ... <SEP> i bought this for a friend of mine. He is a burly man, so this song is really appropriate for him. He now has the nick-name, ""Gummy Bear""."
"Don't buy, not a good cover! <SEP> Wish I would have known, this is not Metallica and not worth the money!"
One Star <SEP> Was not the original band
Five Stars <SEP> Good listening music.
"Fooled By Tribute Band!!!! <SEP> I was tricked & thought it was the real ""Metallica"", but a tribute band!?!?  Knowone can ever replace the real deal.  Hate this song, now! :-("
"cover to a great song. <SEP> Ok, cover to a great song...made me want to listen to the original more than hear this version again."
"Jennifer is fantastic <SEP> As a huge fan of SMASH, I can't say enough about the added dimension with the introduction of Jennifer Hudson. Thiss song, like all the music in Smash, is fun, energetic and done to perfection."
"Disappointed, I didn't realize I was getting a knock ... <SEP> Disappointed, I didn't realize I was getting a knock off. I was shopping for Metallica, not other artists. That's crappy. Read the fine print right?"
"Fade to Crap <SEP> You can't romanticize your own suicide every day for decades and turn out sane.

Loving a song about suicide makes as much sense as eating crap because someone polished it up and called it art.

Fade to crap. That says it all."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome sauce of a song!!!
thought it was metallica <SEP> pretty dumb of me but all I had was 99 cents and the real metallica was 1.29 but you know what ever
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome lyrics
Quick search failure. Definately need to read before purchase. <SEP> Quick search and purchase; ended up with this. Not what I wanted. I really need to read better before purchase.
"false advertising <SEP> I clicked thru the link at iHeart Radio to purchase the ORIGINAL METALLICA version..got this instead...

wish i could get my money back...."
"Great covers of some old school classics. <SEP> Very good covers of some old Metallica classics. If you want to stream some old school Metallica from your prime account I'm sure you've already noticed that true to Metallica's reputation of greed (since Cliff passed) they have no Metallica tunes available here. This is a perfect substitution to help you scratch that itch without buying into that ""New Metallica"" all about the money & not so much about quality music anymore attitude."
the greatest rock voice ever! <SEP> this is the best rock song i've heard in 25 or 30 years. can't stop playing it. i feel like a kid with a new 45 rpm.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it.
classic love song <SEP> i love to listen to covers of popular songs and this is one that i had to have for my collection. unlike their other covers they do not go the punk rock route but that is okay. it is still a very good rendition.
"Terrible circus music and stupid clown gigs <SEP> This was a mistake. Even if free, don't bother. Terrible circus music and stupid clown gigs."
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful song
"Show Stopper <SEP> I'm trying to find an instrumental version . any one know where?

It's a show stopper"" I wrote the words down to learn it immediately"
One Star <SEP> The beginning of the song is missing. It's not supposed to fade-up.
Good sound <SEP> Like it but can't use it
Crappy Recording <SEP> What a waste downloading this song. It sounds like it was recorded from a vinyl LP. It skips halfway through the track!
"Great version! <SEP> This is a great version of this song!  I heard it about 20 years ago and had been looking for it every Christmas since with no luck. I finally found it after sifting through 500 samples from various artists.  Granted, it's not that different from the popular versions from Bing Crosby and Andy Williams, but I like the powerful vocals as well as the big but not drawn out finale."
The Last Stand Soundtrack <SEP> Good Music
"a new direction for charlotte? <SEP> I have been a huge Charlotte Church fan since she was 12.  When she made the transition from a classic style to rock I was surprised, but, the style reinvent actually worked well on both the ""Tissues and Issues"" and ""Back To Scratch"" cd's I liked them a lot.  That being said this new one is yet another music style that I feel would work better if there wasn't an obvious war between vocalist and the music ( esp. on the crescendo periods).  They both are loud and inaudible and cancel each other out.. If the music were not as loud as to cancel the artist it would be more enjoyable.  It isn't until the 6th track that it starts to show a better balance making it easier to listen too...I paid for the download, I listened to the download, she is entitled to be paid.  If I had listened to it prior to purchase I would not have paid for the download...  I hope her next cd is better...Charlotte has such a wonderful voice and an incredible range, please don't hide it in loud music where even the instruments compete with each other and are at times undecernable."
"universalizing the local <SEP> colonization continues in the universalization of the local with this production. Haven't we learned from the ecological disasters that we are creating and recreating around us that christianization = colonization = oppression = degradation
its not about being ONE its about constructing oneness with relationships that allow similarities AND differences and values them...."
One Star <SEP> was unable to download it
"Buy this CD you won't regret it.... <SEP> Actually this is the SECOND Psychedelic 60's that I bought. I sent it to my friend who I used to go out dancing with in the late 60's....she loved it too!!  This music selection is really  a wonderful representative of the 60's....
I would recommend this CD to anyone..."
"Nailed it <SEP> What a fun track. Omar did a great job on this song - a great song, great voice - a great track!"
"Marbles! <SEP> Te amo Canicas!  This is a great song with the sound of the marbles rolling in the background.  Reminds me of being a kid playing on the sidewalk.  Great lilt and ""Texas"" sound."
Great <SEP> The music was very well will done and enjoyable to hear. I think most music lovers would enjoy this type of Latin music.
Canicas Marbles <SEP> Wish I could give a review. The download failed twice. Sorry Amazon but your download feature doesn't work properly.  I spent an hour trying to access the music.
Excellent cd! <SEP> I played the audio samples of the individual tracks before I ordered this cd so was expecting it to be good. I was not disappointed! The songs have been running through my head ever since it arrived!
"Maher-velous! <SEP> I really love Matt Maher's new song, (Holy, Holy, Holy [God with Us]). It does a good job updating the style of the hymn without disrespecting the lyrics; and the chorus is simple, yet profound in the truth it conveys. This would be a fine song-of-the-month for a congregation. It is following a wonderful tradition of updating classical hymns with modern feel and added worship. It speaks well of the song that I've listened to it daily on my laptop since I bought it. Excellent choice! Excellent Price!"
"I Swear <SEP> Loved it then, love it now."
"Wonderful! <SEP> I strongly recommend downloading this track. La Santa Cecilia knocks it out of the park with ""El Hielo"". Masterful songwriting, sparkling musicianship, and a great mix are just a few reasons I rate this so high. The lead vocal, in my opinion is what pushes this track to a 5-star rating. Absolutely beautiful song with a poignant message. Viva la musica!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Pleased with order. Item was as described.
A disappointing song <SEP> I also heard this one on YouTube and this one sound a bit worst than their Brooklyn song. I don't recommend this song.
Two Stars <SEP> Huh
"Amazon Found The Right One! <SEP> Not really much more to say about this song---thanks Amazon for getting this one right!  Great song, great sound, great artist!"
"He .. So so <SEP> I thought it was going to be better. It's ok, nothing fancy. I wouldn't recommend to spend the money if you are a chill out music fan."
So so <SEP> Not worth it. There are better chill music compilations for a better price. I regret buying this mp3. Don't buy it.

"Missing First Bar to Sonata 11 <SEP> Like the CD version and the version in the 40 years box, the mp3 file as of this date is missing the first bar of sonata 11, op. 22, first movement. Sony has known about this problem for four years at least, but has failed to clean it up as of 19 January, 2018. They did send out replacement CDs for purchasers of the 40 Years box but that's about as far as they've gotten, and those are no longer available. The LP version has the missing music, so it's a pure editing error."
"wrong choice <SEP> This was a mistake! Very wrong choice of song. I actually didn't purchase the song, but I was charged for it."
"Nice Song <SEP> Like this song, Very nice and good quality of sound. I used this song for my fitness routine. I recommended."
One Star <SEP> not what I wanted
"Working it! <SEP> If you want to exercise, dance, or just jump around, go for it.  The beat will keep you going for as long as you can move."
"One Star <SEP> beats too fast, all the same basically  blech"
"Nothing like the oldies <SEP> If you like oldies and want good workout music that you can sing along to, then this is it.  Keeps me moving!"
Not the real songs - sad imitations <SEP> I should have read the ad more carefully.  These are old songs which have been jazzed up to make them gym music. The real songs are so much better.
Great Song !! <SEP> This is one of my favorite tracks off the King of the Ghetto Album. Z-Ro gets deep and knows how to talk about that pain.
Five Stars <SEP> Great CD.
I love this song! <SEP> This song has been my anthem this week.  I can't really put into words how this song has uplifted me.  I heard it on the radio and came searching for it as soon as I got home.  I would have purchased an entire album if he had one.
"Say What's In My Heart <SEP> ""How Can You Say That It's Over"" by The Temptations is a stand out track from their overlooked Truly For You album.  Ron Tyson gives an impassioned vocal with classic Temptations harmonies filling in the gaps.  The song has a killer beat that drives the vocas to supreme heights."
Five Stars <SEP> Me goso cantar esta cansion.
"Lyrics & Beats <SEP> Plattedmind, the MC, of Audio(file) is borderline genious!  His wordplay, content, and flow are what MCs aspire to achieve!  This is a must have album and is in constant rotation!  The beats are intricate, entertaining, and original!
A great listen and progression of Hip Hop!
Buy It!"
"funny.. <SEP> very very fast, funny....joyful"
"One of the absolute greatest singers Ever <SEP> One of the absolute greatest singers Ever, but also one of the worst people to choose which songs make it on an album.
I am a fan of TTD, I am not a fan of Sananda after the Wildcard. I write this in hopes and prayers that he might read this (not likely), because I desperately want and wish to hear his quality work again. This Zooathalon (with exceptions to Brimstone Follies, DHS, Stagger Lee Part 1) sucks. I will say more than just ""it sucks"". I will say he spends way to much time enunciating a single word instead of just singing words and following the melody. He's holding notes a second too long. Just let your tongue loose like on your old 'You will pay tomorrow for what you do today,' song when you were impersonating James Brown.  There is no complexity in the music. I hear bridges and choruses, but the beauty is not there. The songs he is picking, and this is the problem, are like happy go lucky songs that sound like your singing nursery songs. I feel like I'm at a Christian campground meeting where someone brings out a guitar and says I can sing. Enough with my not being detailed from a musical standpoint? He hits the same notes over and again. It is monotonous.  All his songs have that pitch of bells and lame, schoolboy happiness beat to them, the variation of musical instruments COMPLIMENTING one another instead of just playing the same keys over with a different instrument is killing me. It is very hard for me to believe this is the same man who wrote the songs from Vibrator or Introducing the Hardline.  So, am I asking for the same old stuff? No, but spend time with one song and let other people listen that ain't kissing up and lying to you because this crap is horrible. Songs I used to like and still like are (Delicate, Wishing Well, TTD's Recurring Dream, Vibrator, Designated Fool, Frankie and Johnny, Neon Messiah, If you go Before Me, Holding ON To You Is MY FAVORITE, Resurrection, I don't want to bring your Gods Down, Who's Loving You,Seasons, When Letting Go,I still love you from Symphony or Damn, and Are You Happy?  I'm not happy with his music choices today. His latest album The Rise of Z might be better and I hope it will be.  The single Blanket on the ground is okay. It is moving in a better direction than his most recent efforts in the last 10 years but still not worth putting on a cd--but again it definitely beats 18 songs from this Return to Zooathalon. I will always check for TTD and have hope for Sananda's music; but since Sananda came I have been severely disappointed by Maitreya. I won't forget what TTD brought and I thank him, and I won't forget how much I absolutely loved that voice and music and  that's why I will continue to try and buy your music that unfortunately--currently sucks.  I add in my comments who TTD should listen to if he is lacking inspiration and direction."
Not what I expected <SEP> I was looking for the karaoke version of this song and of course this one is not karaoke. It also wasn't the best version of this song.
Five Stars <SEP> :)
Utopia is a great album <SEP> Utopia is a great album full of energy emotion and if you like kerli's other music you will love this album.
"Dystopia <SEP> I was excited about this album, even though it was a huge departure from ""Love is Dead."" I loved Army of Love and Zero Gravity, so was excited about the new uber electronica route Kerli was taking. However, the album was just no good. It felt cheap and contrived. Like a mediocre copy of a cheap euro-techno song. Was hoping for much much better. Guess it'll just be another HUGE wait for Kerli's next album."
Five Stars <SEP> Great item! Would highly recommend!
Can't beat quality at this price <SEP> Lots of good stuff at low price (or free if you are lucky).
"Five Stars <SEP> A lot of great music, quality recordings, can't beat the price."
"Four Stars <SEP> after seeing the movie, the soundtrack evokes the same emotions."
One Star <SEP> I thought that I was purchasing the movie instead I got the music!!!  SO disappointing!!!
"Great American <SEP> Outstanding everyone should see this, The story of a great man that needs to be tooled for years and years"
must have <SEP> incredibly powerful and touching. perfectly worthy of the film. i highly recommend this to anyone with a heart that is aware of the event.
Had this on repeat... such a fascinating ... <SEP> Had this on repeat...such a fascinating version!
"for a recommended music I might like, was more country <SEP> this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks."
"Move along <SEP> A nice try, but would not recommend this single.  Maybe the album is better, but I don't think I will waste my money."
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
Five Stars <SEP> I heard this on Vampire Diaries and fell in love with it!
"We are the Lucky Ones <3 <SEP> I love this song. Yes, I've been a fan of the darker, 'Love is Dead' Kerli, I do really like this song and Zero Gravity. Both songs are very inspirational and both songs will just put you in good moods. I really like the songs beat, message and lyrics."
"Worst Kerli song ever <SEP> First, I am sorry to all the other fans out there. I love Kerli as an artist and am deeply disappointed by this track. The music is upbeat, techno-pop with a lot of repeat words. While there is a fairly good meaning behind the song (if you watch the video), the lyrics are lackluster. This is too mainstream, and nothing like the Kerli most of us fell in love with.

Not everyone is going to absolutely love every single song an artist produces and I REALLY wanted to like this one, but it is just too much. Two stars for the love of the artist herself."
Love it <SEP> Shirley Caesar is a pioneer in the gospel world.  To hear her sing with The Thompson Community Choir is awesome.  I really enjoyed this song.  It's one of my best songs.
"makes a mess of the original <SEP> I love the original song and was looking for a good uptempo remix. The sample Amazon provides is absolutely not an accurate representation of what this remix sounds like. This has over a minute of monotonous pulsing intro and the music overlaid the original track makes the song sound off-key. NOT what I was hoping for! I'm sure others may like it, but I didn't. Very disappointed."
Five Stars <SEP> Got it from sons of anarchy show
"One Star <SEP> The 2X was only 38"" across the bust."
"One Star <SEP> This was bought as a present, Norrmally I would not consider buying."
"Great Music That Hits The Spot. <SEP> i have bought numerous editions of these selections offered on Amazon and haven't disappointed.  I like the way the songs are packaged with the chance to edit and arrange the pieces as you personally like.  The sound quality is good and the performances are top notch.  If you like classical music or piano pieces, I can't see why you wouldn't like this one."
"A very beautiful album, full of pieces that I love. <SEP> If you love piano music, this album is a very beautiful treat.  All of the pianists are excellent and this is a great selection of pieces.  I have bought a number of the ""# of greatest piano classics"" variety.  Those are all good and I enjoy them.  However, I think I will be playing this one the most, especially since there are so many pieces played by Jeno Jando.  His playing has so much feeling. Evelyne Dubourg is another favorite. So, I would recommend this collection to anyone who loves piano music."
great song <SEP> great song god is great he's in the midst of our lives he will never leave or forsake us never
Wrong recording <SEP> I thought I was getting the Michelle Pfeiffer/ Sally Dworsky performance. The use of the scene from the movie was misleading.
are you kidding me? Dragon Boy Suede is A ... <SEP> are you kidding me?  Dragon Boy Suede is A mazing!
"No, just no <SEP> I have liked the song for a while bit this is not the song I thought I was buying. The sound is muttled and it seems like a cover being sung by someone NOT SWV."
"NOT the original artists. <SEP> Don't bother with this album, UNLESS you don't care that none of the music on it is by the original artists.  These are poorly produced, volume-c;ipping re-hashes of classic music.  DON'T waste your money OR time on it.  It's a rip off, and I am surprised that amazon ALLOWS copyright infringement like this."
Five Stars <SEP> I love her songs
"ugh <SEP> Not much of a remix.  It's the song as recorded,  followed by some cheesy dj attempting dance mode. I refuse to listen past the first part."
blah <SEP> the original is what I should have bought but I was in a rush to get the song so I downloaded the first one I saw
Five Stars <SEP> This is an awesome praise and worship song and I keep it on repeat
"Stand Still <SEP> I heard this song on some youtube video, then I shazam'd it to make a purchase. Great pop-mock melody that ends well."
"good grief and wow GOOOOD <SEP> I don't think that Otis Redding ever made a recording that wasn't Grade AAA, good grief and wow GOOOOD.  ""I've Got Dreams to Remember"" is all good."
Beautiful! <SEP> I love chanting the Gayatri Mantra.  This version by David Ananda is perfect for someone like me who likes to chant through out my day. This version is just a little under 7 minutes.
Five Stars <SEP> Love the song
suxxxxed balls <SEP> Sucked balls Amazon cannot put the music on the cd it had A million skips on it
Five Stars <SEP> Super awesome cd good quality. Wish it had their old tracks too.
"Eww <SEP> Mickie James is one of the best women's wrestlers of all time. Good thing too, because this song is an absolute joke."
The sound quality is horrible on this song <SEP> The sound quality is horrible on this song. It sounds like a cheap recording of someone covering SWV. This is not the original artist. I feel ripped off.
One Star <SEP> what even is this?
"$10 for one song <SEP> Please.  Certainly it was my fault also, but there is only one cut on this CD and they still are charging almost $10 for it?  What a rip off.  Amazon should have warned us.  And the one song is just so so.  Done with these guys."
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song! XD
"love it <SEP> Love it, must have, pleased. Just wish amazon would carry more anime music / Japanese music. But happy to see they have some."
"As expected of ryo, superb songwriting as always. <SEP> I'm glad that ryo's music is available to purchase, especially this one, as digital downloads here in the U.S. that's NOT on iTunes. It's good to hear ryo's music talent hasn't waned since he went pro, and this song is a fine testament to his skill as a song creator."
"Awesome song! <SEP> It's super catchy and fits perfectly with the feel of the movie. As much as i like Owl City, this should have been the main credits theme. It's a great song that sums up the movie quite nicely."
One Star <SEP> The original is by far the best.
What's not to love! <SEP> It's Lyle Lovett... What's not to love!
"Love This Song! <SEP> I love every song that Demi has recorded, but this is one is by far one of my favorites! Go Demi!"
"Just gets better <SEP> As ever, Hiromi is sublime. Excellent compositions, superbly played, good balance accross the cd between up tempo and quieter tracks makes for an easier, while still engaging, listen. She never fails to lift my spirits."
"Amazing! <SEP> City of Lions is my new favorite band. I heard the song 'Here Is Love' and I bought it right away, I just couldn't get enough. The song was so good and uplifting that I bought all of their songs. I have recommended City of Lions to all of my friends, such a great buy!"
great original sounds <SEP> I really enjoy the music. It is a creative compilation of beat and sounds. It is cutting edge and will lead a new trend.
Just bad. <SEP> This is about as sexy as the soundtrack for an 80s sitcom show. Think 3s Company meets Sanford and Son. Please avoid at all costs.
cloud cult - love <SEP> Love their music
Smooth vocals - Micade/Soundcloud <SEP> Smooth vocals my friend...love the overall feel...very nice work...;-) - Micade  This review was submitted to Matell on is Soundcloud page...
Brings back memories <SEP> Love this song and the movie
"Great track, great movie! <SEP> I love this song and this movie!!!  I am soo glad that the soundtrack is finally available for me to purchase. I have looked for it several times in the past but have always been shot down.  Love it!"
"Great soundtrack! <SEP> I really like this soundtrack, it is a lot of fun to listen to.  I also love this movie, it is one of my favorites!  I'm glad that the soundtrack is finally available for me to purchase :)"
"This is the best <SEP> Always loved Armin Van Buuren's sounds always puts out the best in Trance, I consider him one of the best Trance DJ's out there hands down"
"Great Song, but too short! <SEP> I love this song! I heard it for the first time on the television show Dance Moms and just had to download it to my IPod. I couldn't find it on iTunes, but luckily Amazon had it.  My only problem with the song is that it's too short!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great upbeat song.
"One Star <SEP> Was expecting more, especially from sisters."
"disappointing <SEP> I love the Carolina Chocolate Drops and had heard the sisters sing a song together in concert so I thought this would be a great CD. But on the whole, this is a disappointing album."
Can not download - File Corrupted <SEP> Could not download this song. File is corrupted.
"Peaceful and inspiring! <SEP> I ended up loving this movie and one of the main reasons was the score, which is filled with beautiful and inspiring pieces like this one.  The Pilgrim mythos was brand new to the Wing Commander franchise at the time of this movie (having played all the games I had never heard of them until then) and so they deserved a mystical sort of theme that encompassed the whole of the universe.  Great piece!"
They got mine. <SEP> They got mine. Don't buy his stuff in sets of three thinking they are all good. Only your money is.
"Love turkish music <SEP> I know a Turkish girl at work whom introduced me to Turkish music( food and movies) and I will never look back. This is one of many famous singers with a very beautiful voice, and I just love the instruments used. You can look them up on youtube and browse the many lovely gifted singers."
Cannot open file <SEP> this is not in mp3 format.  when I downloaded it it came through as some kind of a strange file which I cannot open.
"Should have done my research better. Learn from my mistake <SEP> Totally RIPPED OFF!!!
$9.00 for ONE Song 3 minutes 19 seconds long.. Should have done my research better.
Learn from my mistake. Order one item at time..Pissod off. Probably won't use Amazon anymore.
Rick S."
Five Stars <SEP> This band is FANTASTIC!!! Luv em!
The drum accompany are really upbeat. use of back-up ... <SEP> The drum accompany  are really upbeat. use of back-up singers pick-up mood .
Excellent! <SEP> Excellent!
"We Miss You Jenni! <SEP> Me Encanta como lo canta Lupillo con mucho sentimiento :(
We Miss You Jenni!
J16424"
"Completely synthetic, NOT genuine orchestral <SEP> As other reviewers have noted, this is synthesized and completely uninspiring.  Save your money and purchase something performed by real artists on real instruments with passion and feeling.  If you are a classical music enthusiast or even just a casual listener, the .99 cent price is not even worth it."
"Not even worth the price of $0.01 per track. <SEP> I appreciate having been warned off this ""bargain"" by the previous review.

The samples I auditioned on Amazon from this rendering sound uninspired and artificial. Comparing these samples with some of the great many available performances of the same pieces by humans on acoustic instruments (or by serious artists, such as Wendy Carlos, on electronic instruments) makes one wonder why the producers even bothered."
"Synthesizer anyone? <SEP> These sound like they are produced electronically. I am all but positive. And the producers are not really admitting it. But I guess they are ""perfect."" But not very human. The programmer interpreted the notes perfectly."
Love it <SEP> I love and appreciate ol school music. Earth wind and fire music is timeless!! you todays music cannot begin to compare!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> EXCELLENT!
Five Stars <SEP> I LOVE IT!!
"Two Stars <SEP> not the album that I thought, took to long to listen to it and I can't return it"
joyish <SEP> Not as good as I'd hoped. I am somewhat disappointed.
"Good music. <SEP> I play this music when I am reading, or whatever.  It makes very  good listening
music and also background music."
"Mechanical, dull, and boring! <SEP> I bought this album without looking at the reviews first. Once I downloaded it to my computer, I hated it. It sounded like someone on the computer made this. Horrible! A waste of my money and time."
"Not very good, even for a machine. <SEP> This review is based on auditions of sample tracks only. (Same as with 99 Classical Masterpieces in the same series.)

I cannot imagine any human capable of playing the notes in these pieces - or any experienced electronic musician, for that matter - owning up to such lifeless, mechanical renditions.  Even the Chopin and Beethoven tick steadily along at constant tempi.  Close your eyes and you can almost hear a click track.....

If this compilation appeals to you, it will take you very little time to find good, cheap compilations on Amazon featuring the handiwork of real human performers."
"Worst CD ever! <SEP> I sounds like it was played by a computer.  No musicality at all.  Even though it was only .99, it was a waste of money!"
"LOVE RuPaul, but NOT this track! <SEP> I have ALL of RuPaul's previous music (all the way back from ""Supermodel""!) But after creating a dynasty of ""charisma. uniqueness, nerve & talent"" why would RuPaul ever release this messy, off-key mixed bag? Even her cameo and Lucien's auto-tune can't save this one. Sorry, Mama Ru, I love ya, but you should be ashamed of this. I suppose the only saving grace is that a portion of the proceeds go to help a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, donate directly to the charity and save your ears. ""That's all."""
"Love it! <SEP> Love this song.  I loved these guys in their last band, and they aren't letting me down in this new one."
Two Stars <SEP> Didn't enjoy sorry I purchased!
"Amazing as usual! <SEP> My favorite so far from the TBR series...more of a rock sound from Alexz this time. For those who have not heard/listented to her, buy this now! An amazing artist with amazing talent, its a shame the recording industry doesn't see it."
Two Stars <SEP> Sorry I purchased!
"Overproduced piece of garbage. The lyrics are terrible <SEP> Overproduced piece of garbage. The lyrics are terrible, singing is terrible. Grated my ears and didn't have a good part."
"LOVE Ru, HATE this song! <SEP> After creating a dynasty of ""charisma. uniqueness, nerve & talent"" why would RuPaul ever release this off-key mess of mixed talent? Even her cameo and Lucien's auto-tune can't save this. Sorry, Mama Ru, I love ya, but you should be ashamed of this product. I suppose the only saving grace is that a portion of the proceeds go to help a worthy charity.  Do yourself a favor, donate directly to the charity and save your ears. ""That's all."""
Beautiful! <SEP> Got this because I needed something soft and contemporary for a project for a friend who had died. This worked perfectly.
"great song terrible download, half the song and goes in and out. Thanks for nothing <SEP> great song, but the download only downloaded half of the song and the sound is less than good.  download from someone else"
"Love it! <SEP> We both liked the album so much that we also bought this single.  Please - Keep the good stuff coming, guys!"
beautiful! <SEP> Love his music!
Lame <SEP> Clapton's lamest music yet. Slow and stupid showing no flair or ability that any guitarist could have. No imagination and could have been put out by any hack.
Would have liked a better audio quality <SEP> Would have liked a better audio quality.  It sounds like it was ripped off an old shotty casette tape.
Sorry but no prise <SEP> Sad and tinny attempt trying to sound like a Symphonic Orchestra...they just could not pull it off to my disappointment...I do not have anything good to say and I would not accept it if it were free.
Four Stars <SEP> <NULL>
"not what i expected <SEP> how come amazon doesnt let you preview the song?  i just wasted my money, the song is fine its just not the version i wanted.  unhappy.

amazon posted this without addressing the problem or even sending me an email saying i'm sorry, or better yet adding the darn preview.

Please Amazon, I would rather you fix the problem than posting this stupid review."
"Sheer exuberant joy <SEP> I have been a singer my whole life, and there are few things that get to the bottom of my soul like great vocal music.

Since I first encountered Ensemble Basiani at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival in 2010, I have been a big fan.  The Georgian folk music which forms the core of their repertoire is just extraordinary music.  Raw, emotional, incredible.

This piece is a good example of all the hallmarks of Ensemble Basiani's art.  The yodel-like whooping of the high tenors, the ostinato of the baritones, and the quick declamation of text by the middle tenors, alternating between different solo groups and the whole ensemble.  Just great stuff."
"nice and smooth <SEP> nice and smooth good content, would like to see more tehilim inspired songs. great work."
"KODA CHROME <SEP> CUB KODA-THE CUB KODA CRAZY SHOW (VINYL LP): Among the many hats that roots rock historian CUB KODA wore...guitarist/singer for the underrated BROWNSVILLE STATION, author, music columnist and voracious record collector...the Ann Arbor native also hosted an irreverent New England  radio program in the early eighties. The weekly CUB KODA CRAZY SHOW focused on the legendary pioneers of rock from THE EVERLY BROTHERS and  LINK WRAY to HOWLIN' WOLF and ETTA JAMES, with scattered rockabilly, doo wop and RNB obscurities from his personal collection thrown in for good measure. The ""Big Disc Jockey Show in the Sky"", with KODA providing gravelly commentary, wry asides and humorous dee jay patter, would have fit in perfectly with today's celebrity satellite radio offerings lorded over by BOB DYLAN, STEVEN VAN ZANDT and RANDY BACHMAN. One listen to that famously tongue in cheek growl...the same one which opened the BROWNSVILLE staples SMOKIN' IN THE BOYS ROOM and KINGS OF THE PARTY back in the day...and you'll be sucked into CUB's strangely addicting, endlessly educational after hours ""platters that matter"" party.

RATING: FIVE 45'S"
"Unexpected Club Version <SEP> I was expecting to download the original album version, but instead received a live club recording. This is NOT what I had expected!
Do yourself favor, don't order this particular version, it is horrible and very disappointing."
"One Star <SEP> Stupid, don't waste your 0.99 and buy. Rankin Pumpkin need to listen music, not try to make them."
"I'd love to review the music <SEP> --but I can't.  And why is that?  Because I never got the song downloaded successfully.  In my efforts to move away from iTunes, I decided I'd start buying elsewhere..and I tried Amazon first.  Big mistake!  Their purchasing system is so clunky, so cumbersome and their customer service SO inept, that I decided immediately after getting off the phone after being transferred multiple times (I believe I counted 9 transfers, but it's been a while, so I may be misremembering the exact number) I decided I would never again purchase downloads from Amazon.

And I really love this song, too.  I'm very disappointed with this entire transaction.  It's funny that Amazon is asking me to review my purchase this way...after they were unable to assist me via phone and email.  haHA!"
Great addition to my music library <SEP> Love this song.
"Powerful, Powerful, Powerful!!! <SEP> Annointed apostolic music!!!!"
If you're looking to download Power Filled with the Spirit from Amazon link it will not be that song but another <SEP> I did not get the song Power Filled with the Spirit instead I got another song.
Awesome Praise & Worship song <SEP> Awesome  Praise & Worship song!  Thinking about the words of this song blesses my soul!
The Power of Jesus Christ! <SEP> I love this song because William Murphy is a worshipper! Thank you Jesus for getting up with all power in your hand!
Five Stars <SEP> Okay
Five Stars <SEP> Peace in the Midst of the Storm song is AWESOME!
"Producer's comments <SEP> Sometimes, you get lucky, just being in the right place at the right time. For me, that time was a couple of years ago. I was hanging out with my pal Steve Fishell, who was conducting one of his Music Producer Institute courses over at Willie Nelson's studio outside Austin. The subject of their study this time was Lloyd Maines producing some tracks for Robert Earl Keen and his band. One of the participants in the study group was a beautiful young woman named Heather Lingle.

Heather gave me a copy of a DVD she had of her band playing at some gigs up in Montana with her Dirt Dauber band. I stashed in my briefcase and found it in there several days later, played it, and decided I should have listened sooner.

We traded emails for a year or so; Heather was pretty excited about a recording session that she had planned, a chance to showcase her singing and songwriting skills. Fate, as it will do, intervened; a relationship with a guy went south, and the raw products of the recording session went away in his pocket, too. Bad luck for Heather, good luck for me. Because that set the stage for us getting together to record the record you have here.

Some have said that Heather sounds like Emmylou Harris, or maybe Lucinda Williams, and you could say, well, who could ask for more? Complimentary comparisons notwithstanding, Heather has a wonderfully unique voice, and the voice of her songwriting is also not easily cubbyholed into a single neat compartment. This record, Coyote Beauty is a great introduction to those talents.

The songs here offer different glances into her complex and sensitive observations of life. In the title song--Coyote Beauty-- she's having fun with a inquisitive critter of the desert, maybe wistfully wishing she could go with him on his adventure. The haunting and enigmatic lyrics to Green Van that finish the set take us to a more somber and serious place. In between, Heather tells stories about love--lost and found, and courage, and the determination to make today as good as it can be.

This is music to hear again and again, melodies that will surprise you, and lyrical messages that give us fair warning that a major new talent is here.

--Bo Barber"
"So terribly unoriginal, it made me bleed from my ears. <SEP> So terribly unoriginal, it made me bleed from my ears."
"Five Stars <SEP> I love this song,"
Don't buy this song <SEP> Don't buy this song.  It is just a repeat of the same musical phrase over and over and over.  It is not even a good edit job!  Get this song from someplace else.
"Pictures By Terry McDermott <SEP> As Season #3 The VOICE runner-up, Terry proved he has a unique sound rooted in rock-n-roll...He wowed the judges every week and now with the release of his new song, Pictures, he is wowing his fans!  McHobbits!!  You won't be disappointed & Terry delivers with his great voice and lyrics.  He is the real deal and my family looks forward to more music from this talented artist!"
Five Stars <SEP> I really grooved to this track. Been listening to it non-stop in my car.
Sucks <SEP> Is this a joke lol i would give NO stars lol
Loving the vibe <SEP> Love the vibe of the songs on the cd great mix of music for anyone just needing to break away from the norm!
Two Stars <SEP> Can't get  it to play.
"Very disappointed. Now will dump this song in the recycle ... <SEP> I thought I was downloading ""'This ain't no place for a hero"" from the Max series Strikeback. This is not that theme song. Very disappointed. Now will dump this song in the recycle bin. Will have to be more careful with what the search returns."
"great music ... missing song <SEP> This should be listed as instermental as  no place for no hereos isn't here as a complete song like in the game.

5 stars if it were here false advertising imo."
"One Star <SEP> Was the wrong song. Wanted ""This ain't no place for a hero"" from the Max series StrikeBack."
"Though the acoustic is actually kinda nice. Imo <SEP> It's not the actual song, just an acoustic. Though the acoustic is actually kinda nice. Imo."
No lyrics <SEP> This does NOT have the lyrics from the game.
One Star <SEP> Horrible acoustic track that doesn't match the write rest of the album
"Great song! <SEP> This song is great! I cannot wait for the album release. I wish I could have seen them in concert here in the States, but we received heavy snow that day and could not travel."
Five Stars <SEP> love it
I fell in love with her voice on Jerry Jeff Walker's first album ... <SEP> Johanne Vent was a backup singer on many albums in the late 60's & 70's.  I fell in love with her voice on Jerry Jeff Walker's first album on Decca.  I found this album on vinyl years ago and  couldn't believe it had been reissued on CD.  It's a great album.  White R&B done very well.  I believe it's the only album she ever made--what a shame.
"FANTASTIC!! <SEP> FANTASTIC  !!!  I""VE WAITED FOR THIS CD SINCE I BOUGHT THE ALBUM WHEN IT CAME OUT !!!  THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON !!!"
Still Popular in the Universal One Church Today! <SEP> This has been my favorite rendition of the Lord's Prayer ever since she came out with it in 1973. Still just amazing as it was nearly 50 years ago. ~ Brother Michael Universal One Church Radio Network http://www.universalonechurch.org
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!! <SEP> Why even bother putting this kind of junk out. Nothing worth listening to here. Guess they will have to work for a living now.
awesome song <SEP> i always loved brandi so i had to support her and buy this song. song is not like what is mostly played on the radio these days
"If when things look dim, light will always shine through <SEP> THIS SONG REALLY SPEAKS TO THE SOUL. IT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO CRY, SMILE & LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME WHILE LISTENING."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful.
Five Stars <SEP> My daughter just love this album and hear it again and again.  It's so inspiring.
Beautiful rendition of a classic song. <SEP> In this beautiful rendition of the classic Henley song she sounds honest and affected. I enjoy her range and look forward to listening to her other songs.
"and she is happy so I'm happy <SEP> Bought this for my wife, She loves it....and she is happy so I'm happy....lol"
Four Stars <SEP> great
"The music is good, but the disc is terrible <SEP> I enjoyed the music, but because the disc was a bad copy of the original I wasn't able to move between the tracks easily. I returned the disc for a new one, but received another bad copy. I am in the process of returning this disc and hope to find a better vendor."
sounds fx kill song <SEP> The sound of the pond kills the beautiful song. Wish I had gotten original version. Wish I could replace this one.
"Great disc! <SEP> I purchased this disc because DGM will be playing at a concert I am attending (Progpower USA) and I wanted to familiarize myself with them. I didn't expect to love this album as much as I do. Best track = Repay, but the whole album rocks."
"Not quite meeting potential <SEP> God, I wanted to like this so much more than I do.  I'm firmly giving it 4 stars, but it could have been a six star album had they worked on their lyrics and vocal melodies a bit more.  The music is as good as I've heard in years, ultra crisp, razor sharp riffage with some groove.  Just insane guitar/bass work.  Sick is  better word.  I really do not want to come down on a talented vocalist like Mark, but he wasn't up to the music on this one.  He shows one vocal range, high.  I'd like to see him do some more mid-range, tenor stuff cause I know he's capable.  Maybe it was the production but his vocals also seemed very thin on this.  And, please don't write lyrics using a Google translator.  A lot of the passages and verses are in very broken English and are distracting from the overall final product.

All of the abbove considered, this is musically as good as anything I've heard in half a decade.  They just missed a half-step with the vocals.  It's still worthy of a four-star review and purchase.  I often see potential where others see perfection, so that's were my criticism comes from.  They were thisclose to putting out the prog metal album of the year."
"Nothing like i thought-  i want to sue  Q magazine for misleading me and wasting my credit <SEP> I had some store credit and couldn't find the album I was looking for so I read a review on this- it mentioned  sampled cut vocal and film snippets-  almost all instrumental-- it mentioned M83 etc etc... it had a great minimalist album cover- geometric colorful...so I thought ""what the heck"" ill take a chance...... big mistake

Theres is nothing innovative or remotely interesting here.. in fact after the first song I thought this was emergency broadcast network under a new moniker some 20 years later. The music is mundane( dare I say sounding like a  bad electronic rock version of coldplay at times but with a dated 80s feel and production- the electronics sound like midi locked in unoriginal simple grooves- the drums are awful - the guitar tries to emulate the 4ad sound at times but because its trying to hard to be catchy fails.

The production is boring and the music is uninspiring-  more rock then electronic which done right is fine but here its not --I recommend EBN early cabaret Voltaire dj shadow focus group belbury poly and ofcourse early M83 over this any day..

Its been years since I felt this cheated- how this got 5 star reviews by others is beyond me- either they are friends of the band or they have questionable taste in music... the only redeeming aspect is the artwork and some vocal samples that were ruined by the tepid and lackluster music ... live and learn I guess!!"
"Mystery <SEP> Cool whale song. Builds suspenseful emotion, and picks up speed until the final retreat. Puts you in an ocean mood."
"A guitar player who is just flat brilliant at making the guitar sing for him. <SEP> I freely admit to being a snob about listening to guitar players.  Growing up with the likes of Eric Clapton, Santana and SRV just made me that way.  Tinsley Ellis is just that good in Catalunya, period."
Still my favorite ride soundtrack! <SEP> I love it! Every second! If you have it loud enough it even feels like your on the ride! Fantastic music!
"Not even complete!! <SEP> The song starts off ""..all we ever got""
instead of one love one shot is all we ever got...um WTF amazon?"
"an acquired taste <SEP> When I first got this album, I did not find it greatly pleasing.  Same reason as many people are taken aback by it.  It is quite different than the music on Maria Schneider's previous albums.  I rarely like vocal music, and I generally find in jazz that the longer songs are the ones I like better.  Plus these songs aren't really jazz.  I mentally relegated it to the category of ""this is in the CD collection but I probably will rarely listen to it"".

Today I was listening to The Thompson Fields and one song I like on it is Walking by Flashlight.  I noticed that by golly that song is on this album also.

So I listened to the album.  And I have a very different perspective on it this time.  There are many beautiful songs. And while I rarely like vocal music, if it is very beautiful I am able to appreciate it.  The vocals here are very beautiful.

Another thing that takes a bit of getting used to:  The compositions have a fairly unified style, and it is a style that I am not particularly used to.  But once I gave them a chance I found that they have a lot of beauty."
"Wow very unfortunate purchase. <SEP> What a disappointment!  It was like if the Hallmark Channel made a musical,  with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber's  not so talented distant cousin writing the score. Talky-Singy songs that really started and went no where. Simple sophomoric un-interesting boring music as whole, good vocals but hey bad music is bad music. 50 year old male musician here ( jazz/classical). Might be more appealing to females??"
One Star <SEP> did not meet my expectations at all - very  disappointed
"The ending is gone, it needs the ending to be complete. <SEP> Let me be clear THE ONLY reason why i am rating this as one star is because the ending of the song is cut off. The audio quality is absolutely amazing and if you have bass when you listen to this song you want to weep tears of joy. This is probably one of THE BEST theme songs EVER. We need to down rate this so we can get the full song in HD quality."
"THIS BAND ROCKS! <SEP> I always loved this band. The new music is a great addition to their catalog. Go on and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
I hope they put out some more music soon. Also check out Little Caesar's latest music. Another great band that got overlooked."
90's dudes <SEP> Good rock track
"This is very stupid!! <SEP> It should be clearly stated that the MP3 files we can listen only on Amazon Music Play application.
This is very stupid !!! If I paid why I can't get the MP3 files downloaded on my PC then it is up to me which music player I'll use.
I wanted to copy those files onto my flash drive then listen the songs in my car. If I can't do that then I'll request full refund !!"
NOT the original tune that was popular back in the day. <SEP> Ugh! It is NOT the one by Foster Sylvers I was looking for. This should not come up in the search when I specifically typed in Foster Sylvers name.
Five Stars <SEP> reminds me of the word 'grateful'
"One Star <SEP> There is no English to accommodate the Spanish spoken. If you don't already know Spanish, this is no use."
"Rip-Off <SEP> The music on the CD was wonderful--however, The Great Gate of Kiev was the only selection on the entire CD.  The CD contained about 7 min of music.  What's up with that?  I feel completely ripped off."
Five Stars <SEP> It's Ghostface Killah... nothing but FLAMES!!!
Rockin' VideoGame Instrumetal <SEP> This album is one rockin album. I can't seem to skip any of the tracks on it. Best album (of theirs) since the first Leg Vacuum came out. The only band of this ilk that I enjoy more is Powerglove (which I highly recommend if you dig this metal sub-genre).
"CLASSIC <SEP> classic song! awesome by The New Breed, great album, love the message and energy! Check out The Tunnel Rats if you haven't already"
"Ripoff !!!!! <SEP> Listen carefully and you will hear that all the tracks are ""alternate"" versions of the original songs you might remember from your childhood.  Certainly not the originals, possibly even ""covers"" from unknown artists. This was a total waste of my money !  Shame on Amazon for fronting something like this.  It is deception at best. If like me you sample the snipets through tiny laptop speakers or are unfamiliar with the original tunes, you may not notice this and you will be sucked in like I was. I'll avoid anything from K-Tel from now on as these 3 discs are not worth the blank CD's I burned them on."
sounds creepy and not at all what i wanted <SEP> I only bought this because I couldn't buy the original on the soundtrack separate from the album. Waste of money!! I always skip it if it comes on!
"Great compilation album <SEP> This ""best of"" album had great choices to feature the voices of The Boones from their albums back in the 80's (and some in the 70's).  They made a few albums prior to Debby Boone's solo fame.  Arguably Debby is the most well-known, but ALL of the Boone women are truly talented.  The original album had a cardboard insert that listed the song information and musicians.  (This was the early version of liner notes.)

"NOT Doro Pesch <SEP> For anyone wondering, this ""Doro"" is NOT famed German metal queen Doro Pesch. This is some kind of lame dance track."
I like this guy's style... <SEP> I first heard his 'Shadow Man' and loved it...got online and purchased it...then this one and another one or two besides! Love his voice and style a lot!
Five Stars <SEP> great song

"good mystery show... UNLISTENABLE MP3 download <SEP> ""Boston Blackie"" was a solid 1940s mystery show, unfortunatley the MP3 download of ""merry-go-round murder"" was so full of hiccups & audio drop-outs as to be unlistenable. I filed a complaint & requested credit with Amazon but never heard back. I'll stick with the reliable Radio Spirits CD box sets & avoid these crappy MP3 radio show downloads in the future.....  no thanks.."
Very cool session of rare pink Floyd recordings <SEP> Quick delivery. Very cool session of rare pink Floyd recordings. Perfect for a Floyd fan.
Music forever! <SEP> Favorite song forever! Will always bring back memories of listening to my parents'  music.
"Great artist! <SEP> Excellent song, great song writer. I look forward to seeing more from this artist."

"Liked them when they first came out <SEP> Liked them when they first came out.  This cd is just kind of boring and not really all that original.  New singer is not my favorite, makes them sound like a 90's band."
Five Stars <SEP> This has a wide variety of music with great sentimental feel to it.
Sound quality is poor. I have some of the songs on other ... <SEP> Sound quality is poor.  I have some of the songs on other albums and the difference in quality is huge.
These are un-listenable versions!!! <SEP> Do not buy!  These versions are horrible!!!  I want my money back Amazon.  Please help!!!  Listen to samples and you will understand.
Five Stars <SEP> So Djenty!
Five Stars <SEP> Great C D.
"Best Priest album <SEP> Quickly becoming an all-time favorite album. Know what to expect from this. It's not your (stereo)typical rap.

This album takes me to my own secret, spiritual world everytime I listen. I can truly see myself still listening in 10 years."
"Soulful, Sweet Artist <SEP> Like the title says, Elspeth sings a sweet, soulful melody with words of intention.  Listen to the whole song to hear the lovely piano and cello solos.  Can't wait to hear her next release!"
Five Stars <SEP> They are a fun band to see live in concert.
"Spanish language ? <SEP> Well, I ordered this cd because it said SPANISH language, but when I had the auto rip description it was in Italian. I wanted it in Spanish, so I had to cancel the order, and delete the auto rip too... Laura Pausini's songs are beautiful, but I like to hear her songs in Spanish..."
"Another long time item on the want list, made this die hard Stryper fan happy. <SEP> This has been on my want list for literally over 2&1/2 decades! It's not a vinyl, but the 4 track 3"" CD Maxi Single. Remember those? Well it is the companion piece to my other Stryper 3"" single Always there for you. I Believe In You was their sappy power ballad that was on the MTV airwaves of 1988. The other 3 tracks are Together Forever live, Come To the Ever Life, and the Robert Sweet Interview Part 2. Aside from the fact I can still count the amount of 3"" CD's in my collection on one hand, I finally get to hear the other half of the interview. Wow, this is truly like a window back in time. Stryper's music to this day is very special in my life. I was at an impressionable age, when rock musicians seemed like larger than life super heroes, at the time this came out. They showed me the way to the real life!"
"2 minutes of heartmelting innocence <SEP> This charming tune is the epitome of Herman's Hermits [aside from the indisputable renown of ""I'm Henry VIII, I Am""] in that it's a short, sweet serenade in which the singer pines for a girl."
"Five Stars <SEP> Good product, thanks!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love Sam cooke
Five Stars <SEP> In love with Sam cooke
"Tommy Dorsey at his best <SEP> Toe-tapping excellence.  I believe this one cut will make you a fan favorite of Tommy Dorsey for the rest of your life. Almost impossble to resist dancing around the room with a smile on your face.

 Big Band at it's best !"
Five Stars <SEP> Love sam cooke
Bad product information <SEP> Amazon listed this as an audio CD but I received a tape.  I don't even own a tape player.  BE AWARE.
"A well played and well recorded album <SEP> The David Barret Trio album is a well played and well recorded album of mainly instrumental music in a power trio format. Using a mandolin on several songs to state the melody line is a nice touch. The compositions are perhaps a bit less melodic and more riff oriented than I tend to enjoy. But this remains a likeable album. I would contrast this to the Andy Timmons Band release playing Sargeant Pepper's; because that was done with only a single guitar and no-over dubs. I would like to see Dave Barrett write his next work with that in mind, because he does play very well."
Five Stars <SEP> DAVID BOWIE IS THE BEST!!!!
Nice product. <SEP> Exactly what I was expecting.  Perfect size and doesn't look cheap. Very pretty on my vanity table. Holds my swabs and cotton rounds perfectly and looks better than having those plastic packages around. Lids are nice too. Can't always find those and it keeps everything sanitary.
Very churchy. I was hoping for a different sound ... <SEP> Very churchy.  I was hoping for a different sound.
"Uneven with Great Highlights <SEP> This somewhat uneven album is a collection of various Newfoundland songs sung at the March Hare festival.  (The March Hare was a roving literary and music festival celebrating Newfoundland talent.  I'm not sure which particular year(s) and location(s) were the source of these tracks.)

At its best, this album is absolutely spectacular.  My favorite is ""Lonely Waterloo"", a lovely version of the standard broken token tale sung (unaccompanied) in harmony by the sibling duo of Stephanie and Daniel Payne.  Last.fm shows I have listened to this track 61 times --- this is actually the most-listened-to song in my collection!  I think by itself it easily justified the cost of the full album for me.  There's also a nice set of Emile Benoit tunes played by the ""Cow Head Cowboys"" (one of whom is Daniel Payne), another nice unaccompanied song ""The Old Smythe"", and classic 1980s folk song ""Pad's Song"" (here called ""Old Punt""), sung by its author, Pat Byrne.

There's also solid tracks sung by Des Walsh, Fergus O'Byrne, Shirley Montague, Jim Payne, and Ron Hynes.

In general, I don't listen to this album straight through very often, but I've listened to the highlights over and over again."
Smooth trip down the river.... <SEP> Nice find these Soft Hearted Scientists.... do yourself a large favor and dip your toes in Song from the River by them.
"All the above <SEP> Because i was thrilled with everything and the way it arrived on time if not before.  This is why I shall always do business with Amazon.
Peggy"
"Great cover of a great song. <SEP> Really unique vocals laid over a classic country song. A singular, haunting voice gives the song a weight the original 4-man tune - while very good in its own right - simply didn't have."
"I feel like I'm having an Emergency Now <SEP> The audio on this song must have been switched by Scott, he always goofs stuff up, but it literally sounds like somebody was at a park reading terrible poems. You just hear birds chirping and water and it is pretty relaxing until some lady starts whispering into the microphone. If this song was an actor, it would be Eric the Midget. The Jackie puppet getting kicked in the crotch would make a better noise. If they played this on America's Got Talent, Howard would have to tell them they have no talent and should give up on making music. Benjy's girlfriend sings better than this."
"These selections are the very best. <SEP> I bought this album as a teenager and budding cornet player. I played it over and over again and know each selection by heart. Every note, who comes in where....these recordings are in my blood. While Nichols recorded these songs more than once, with different personnel, to my mind, these are the definitive recordings of the songs; nice and tight as can be. Being a Bix Beiderbecke fan as well, I don't subscribe to the popular wisdom that Nichols was a Bix wannabe, I see very little resemblance between the two. Nichols was playing in jazz bands and recording prior Bix's first recordings. Red admitted that he was influenced by Bix's recordings, but Nichol's style was already formed.

These recordings are from the late 20's. Members of the groups Nichols led that perform on these cuts are a who's who of famous musicians: Goodman, the Dorseys, Glenn Miller, Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Adrian Rollini...too many to mention. It's too bad the back of the original LP isn't available to show who performed in each session.

I'm so happy to have these MP3s of one of my favorite albums."
Five Stars <SEP> Quite possibly the best cover I've ever heard.  Love The White Buffalo and all his other work.
Two Stars <SEP> Didn't care for it
New Discovery <SEP> I found the video for Cuckoo and loved it! Loved it enough to buy the whole album. Great new music find!
"Not the true popular track <SEP> I was highly disappointed with this watered down version
of 5'Oclock. Check out youtube for the popular
thorough beat track by Nonchalant.
I you are a lover of positive messages in hip-hop
and a mentor of teens this title says ALL.
Amazon needs to get the True Popular track......."
"Four Stars <SEP> Love Arabic music, specially the traditional. My gripe is I only know very few words in Arabic."
Only 1 song. It's good but a 4 minute CD <SEP> Love Jesse Royal however this album is only 1 short song. Not the 11 bucks + shipping JMO
"Yes, I feel it.  I feel this girl is gonna be a star. <SEP> This is the first single from this talented country singer from South Florida.  She wrote and recorded this when she was just 16 y.o.  It is a ballad about falling in love for the first time.  The words and music are beautiful, as is her voice.  Keep an eye (and an ear) on this girl, she is going to be a star."
"Surf rock meets gospel <SEP> I could listen to this track all day. He also released an instrumental version, which is great, too. You can hear him play live if you're lucky enough to live in Portland, Oregon!"
Five Stars <SEP> Pura Raza
"Beautiful Soundtrack <SEP> This work is by a budding composer who is quickly making a name for himself in the independent community for his excellent fast work.

This CD contains a wide range of styles and is a joy to listen to."
"Substantial Effort from Australia's Tripod <SEP> Men of Substance showcases the band in studio with a full rhythm section arrangement, which is not how they usually perform.  The band has a great chemistry about them in a live setting, and much of the entertainment is in their choreography, the way they banter about with one another, and theres an energy present that draws the viewer in.  On this newest album, the visual aspect is gone, but the spirit remains, and Men of Substance is a great album in that regard.

Upon first listen, I almost didn't keep going because the first two cuts, Adult Contemporary and DILF, sounded different in their musical energy than what I was used to hearing from the band.  The humor and commentary are just as timely and biting as ever, as if both opening songs justify the cover art  the band looks older, more mature, and comfortable in their station in life.  The songs work, though, with Adult Contemporary revealing that its no longer about being cool, but about keeping warm, and DILF (it doesnt mean what you think it means) revealing that they know what the older women like, and they are ready to be those calm, centered, stable men.  Tongue in cheek, to be sure.

The full band arrangements give great life and energy to many of the songs, including Triangle of Happiness (a gloriously delirious sendup of how we view the superficiality of location, location, location), the mid-week party rock song Thursday (dont stop me  cause I can stop myself), and one of my favorites from the album, One More Annoying Couple, which contains some of the best harmonies the band has ever recorded.

Several of the songs support the age the band is feeling, including the throwback to home computing at a time when programs were still found on cassette tapes (Waiting For the Game to Load), and planning for the future (The Blueprint).  These songs belong in Tripods canon, even though fans of the band may find them a little left of center based on their previous works.  But really, when you have a band this good taking stock of their advancing age, when they can handle it so deftly as they do on these songs, you cant deny that they work very well.

Of course, surrealism pokes it head on a few tracks.  Lingering Dad, a track that was featured in its live form on the Songs From Self Saucing album, finds the full band arrangement here adding an epic feel to its short runtime.  BAS Time is a fun, mind-bending look at filling out a Business Activity Statement (tax forms for us Yankees), and any fan of mathematics will enjoy this one.  And I Am Beautiful makes me laugh every single time I hear it.  Absolutely priceless."
OK! <SEP> It's ok.
"Ideal entry point to the sound currents of Steve Roach <SEP> This is proving to be one of my favorite pieces of electronica by Steve Roach and an ideal platform for anyone not familiar with his 'soundscapes', as he calls them.  Check out longer downloads of his music at [...] , and try some of his other releases.  He is a prolific producer of music that ranges from the traditional German analogue sounds of 70s bands such as Tangerine Dream, Popul Vuh, Kraftwerk (know known as the Berlin sound); right up to the extraordinary beautiful minimilist structures of sound called 'deep space' that defy proper description.  This album contains a perfect blend / balance of both.  That's why it makes an ideal step along the soundworlds path for the faithful, or an enticing and intoxicating start for the novice. Either way - beautiful music and sound design for today's stressful urban world.
I gotta say that I have been listening to Steve for ten years now and his albums seem to be getting better with each release - either that or I am so spaced out with his sounds I no longer know my analogue from my digital.
This release contains elements of his low volume ambient works (such as A Deeper Silence - my all time favorite piece) where the sound carries you out of this world - into the space between spiral arms of our galaxy; to the analogue frenzy of Arc of Passion, Core, Light Fantastic.  However, it most closely resembles Steve's last release: Dynamic Stillness for a general mix of all the soundscapes he has made uniquely his own.
Whatever, I love this album and consider it part of my escape kit back to sanity - a toolkit for the soul.

Great <SEP> Great
Five Stars <SEP> Thumbs up !
"I love it, You will too <SEP> OK so it's Disco, but it is quality Disco, I love it, You will too."
"This is a wonderful rockin' song <SEP> This is a wonderful rockin' song.  Just listen to those strings and horns.  The pulsing beat is unrelenting and astounding, you will move your a**."
"ZERO Stars <SEP> Seriously, this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.
I would've given it zero stars if that choice were available.
Actually, because I accidentally bought it, I would like to give it NEGATIVE STARS, as in, it owes me money and time.

This is NOT THE OFFICIAL VERSIONS OF THE THEME SONGS as you remember them.
This is keyboard recordings of those songs. Seriously, bad 80s Casio keyboard styled Muzak versions.

DO NOT BUY!!!

"so opaquely obsessive, and yet so transparently rote <SEP> Listen to Unto Ashes with red candles burning in your black-painted room or with black candles burning in your red-painted room  and groove to the droning gloom. The quasi-ironic cover of a Van Halen song closing the album will signal that it is time for your date to go home, and change her clothes and remove the white make-up and black nail polish before her parents get home, though she will have been enamored of you enough to sneak out to see you again, because you tell her, ""You are so beautful you almost look dead."""
Kitty Ate The Tinsel <SEP> This is a song we used to play many years ago. Brings back memories; that's mostly why I like it so much.
"Nostalgic and energetic <SEP> I loved the movie and bought the soundtrack tape a while ago. If you like Swing and Big Band with a nostalgic flavor, this is a great CD with some great compilations from Joe Jackson. Seeing the movie first (a great under-rated movie with alot of visual flair) helps conjure wonderful nostalgic imagery while you listen to the CD."
This song is bad recorder it has a background sound in the middle ... <SEP> This song is bad recorder it has a background sound in the middle of music like a murmur voice when the orquestra play.
disappointed <SEP> not a good version.  should have listened to it before buying.
One Star <SEP> Don't like remastered versions of classics
Five Stars <SEP> Great as always
"For Hip Hop Fans of the Old School Music! <SEP> If you're into Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest then you'll love this hit.  It is a remix of one of Craig Mack's best 1990's rap hits when he was on the Bad Boy record label.  I actually like this remix and the original more than Mack's other break out single ""Flava In Ya Ear,"" which is also very good.

The beat and baseline on this hit are so well put together and an excellent exhibit of Q-Tip's skills as a track maker and all-around hip hop great.  This is just one of his many hits, including the song ""Crooklyn Dodgers"" done with Special Ed, Master Ace, Buckshot (from Black Moon) and Ali Shaheed Muhamed (DJ from A Tribe Called Quest).

For me this is a gem far as music is concerned.  It is well worth the purchase.  I'm glad I bought the track.  Happy Music Listening!

Jax"
Showed up on my account! <SEP> I did not order this product.
Five Stars <SEP> Good quality.
"Exquisite, inspirational, COOL <SEP> Yusef Lateef is an amazing, talented musician.  This ensemble is of the highest caliber.  I recommend it to everyone who appreciates the power of creativity."
"'Lightweight' Flamenco Light <SEP> Even by the standards of Nuevo Flamenco, this CD is a lightweight. It is pleasant enough, but the guitar work is too simple, save your money!"
Cd would not play <SEP> It was a four CD Set & the fourt cd would not play at all &I no sound at all.
"Get On the Dance Floor <SEP> Nils delivers that smooth jazz sound with a dance groove that makes ""Get On the Dance Floor"" a pleasure to have in your music library."
Must Listen <SEP> FANTASTIC album! This is independent music at its finest!! I saw them perform at SXSW and they kicked ass! Had to buy their album and have had it on loop for days.
Amazeballs <SEP> Really refreshing to stumble on something like this after a million and a half crappy new self produced bands. Just stop and think... okay... okay... really!
LOVE THIS! <SEP> Seth Reeves is a lyrical god and a wonder of a guitarist. Him and his band members not only nail it on the album but play the best live show in the DFW area. I adore this band and knwo you will too!
Great Talent Here!  Great song! <SEP> It's wonderful to see youth standing up to make a difference.  This song is very well sung with significant meaning!
did not order <SEP> I have no idea how this got on my phone. I didn't order it. I will not listen to it a second time. Not to my liking.
One Star <SEP> Too much music.  Not enough bugs.
Five Stars <SEP> Great worship cd that stirs revival!
"It's horrible <SEP> I would advise everyone not to buy this , it is a total waste of your money , it is not the original recordings .Sounds like he's trying to be an opera singer instead of the wonderful country artist he is .It's horrible your better off buying another title. Dont buy it!"
"Form and function <SEP> This is not a review of the CD, to which I've not yet listened, but rather of last night's performance of the music at the CD release show.  It's pretty good.  Dramatizations are a great way to get in touch with history, if they're any good (I wouldn't have the faintest idea who was who in the Cold War if not for William F. Buckley's spy novels), and this presentation was pretty good.  The underlying music is attractive, evoking a deep sense of mood but still groovy, and very well performed.  The narration fits in very well and does a good job storytelling.  The sung part is not very extensive but I'm looking forward to listening to it again more carefully."
"Can Atilla CD feedback <SEP> I discovered his '1453 Sultanlar Askina' accidentally at Istambul airport and was completed smitten by it. Being a deep appreicator of music and being a long time student of music, per my analysis - '1453' remains his best...do purchase that one - strongly recommended."
"Feedback on ""Omni"" <SEP> Again..I was compelled to listen to preview tracks of ""Omni'. Did not like the work in this CD. Find it to be very common place. I am rather impressed by Can Atilla's '1453 Sultanlar Askina' my first accidentally purchased but now a proud posession. I'd not recommend 'Omin'...not a great work in my view...and this comes from a person who is trained in Indian classical, Indian folk, Indian light music and has collected music from more than 10 countries. Instead go for Can Atilla's 1453 and also his work in the Blue Color cover CD that is advertised inside the leaflet in the jacket of his '1453' CD."
Five Stars <SEP> Great cover of a Judy Garland classic!
Can Atilla's 'Concorde' CD compared to his '1453 Sultanlar Askina' <SEP> I still continue to like '1453' a lot more than 'Concorde'. I find 'concorde' tunes very mundane as compared to the truley amazing tunes of his '1453' CD. I'd not rate 'concorde' as a great buy! Sorry but my refined sense of music does not permit to me to rate the 'Concorde' CD as great. I missed the 'mystic' sense that I've now learned to associate with Can Atilla's work becuase '1453' was the first of his work that purchased. 1453 is and experience of being in heaven/bliss while 'Concorde' is ground level experience!
"Someone to watch out for <SEP> Well written intelligent songs that beg the listener to sing along.  Superb band and ripping guitar!  Human Nature, Now is the Time, and Speak Clear stand out.  Borderline is so appropriate as the last cut, followed by a surprise Coda.  And these are the old songs.  Can't wait to hear the new material!"
Five Stars <SEP> You need to get this one back in stock plus Bobby Valentin new CD mi ritmo es Buenos !!!!
"Lost in ""Wonderland""! <SEP> ""Wonderland"" is an amazing song. Only certain songs get stuck in my head or really speak to me. This is one of them. But maybe it is because of the break-up I went through last year, which was right around the time I first found this song. ""Do you ask why I'm so blue? I've been holding my  breath for you! And I've tried so many times just to get it through your mind... You know that it's sad but true..."" are some of the lyrics. Sounds an awful lot like what I went through. Heh. ""Do you ask why I'm so blue?"" for me correlates to how my ex behaved after he left me. It was like he was wondering why I was so sad and why we couldn't just all be friends again (me, him and the girl who backstabbed me by taking him). ""I've been holding my breath for you!"" goes with how long I waited, hoping he would just come back to my house and choose me over her since we were together for seven years... ""And I've tried so many times just to get it through your mind- you know that it's sad but true!"" I tried nearly all summer to let him know how much he had killed me and my family and how much I had missed him. He kept saying he was sorry and saying he felt bad for me, but that was it.

Either way though, with or without my story, this song has great lyrics, a great beat and a great tune. I wouldn't put it on a list of classics like with something like ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You"" or ""I Will Always Love You"", but it is great. In fact, better than a lot of newer songs I've heard of late."
A Church rocking song for sure !! <SEP> Powerful.  Uplifting.  If you enjoy gospel music you will enjoy the message delivered in this song. Get ready to move about!!
"Love this woman!! <SEP> I've seen Amena a few times now, live at a conference.  She is amazing!!!!"
"Shiny and Sparkling! <SEP> Perfection in melody, rhythm, timbre, key... Feeds my body and soul. Gifted and talented musician who lives music, playing some original compositions and arrangements. Very glad I purchased it."
Five Stars <SEP> Like it
Great song <SEP> Great movie. Great song. It's exactly like the movie song. I love it. Great quality. Highly recommend to any Hobbit lovers.
"great song; bad audio <SEP> I really like the song, but you can barely hear the words over the music.  The background music is too loud and is high pitched which makes my ears hurt.  There are many versions of this song, but I picked the wrong one."
"One Star <SEP> I was thinking in terms of jokes,not sales."
"Distributors of Smooth Chill Dinner Background Instrumental songs - suck. <SEP> Along the song was terrific and I purchase it to make a book trailer, the distributor put a block on it and wouldn't allow it to be imported into Windows Movie Maker. For that reason, the producers suck. I purchased the song, I ought to be able to use if for something that I'm not making money on."
Don't waste your money <SEP> Not full song.  Short version that is played at hockey games.  Don't waste your money.
Five Stars <SEP> Great cover of a great song!
"No offense meant towards Luke and Aaron who both seem to be great guys! This instrumental version is a great way ... <SEP> I've been a fan since STB was first released and I was a young teen.  Ted is the soul that remains of the band that was the REAL Tourniquet Ted, Guy, Gary, Victor, and Erik.  No offense meant towards Luke and Aaron who both seem to be great guys!

This instrumental version is a great way to enjoy the quality of Tourniquet music without the vocals, which are very hit and miss on the last several albums.  The regular album is great too if you can get a hold of it at a decent price!"
"Beautiful Soul <SEP> I just saw Christina live at a Santa Barbara brewery. She plays a bluesy, bluegrass, southern rock sound that I've heard few women with which to compare, think Alison Krauss and Susan Tedeshi. Christina's own arrangements of the standards make them almost unrecognizable and feel almost entirely like her own, however her originals really show her abilities off. How she hasn't gained further recognition for her soulful performances is beyond me..."
"Sensitive poetry weaved into music <SEP> Frances artfully weaves thoughtful poetry into her music, which can be intensely thoughtful or delectably light - the listener can easily go either way."
You'll never eat calamari again... <SEP> One of the most fun TAL podcasts I have listened to. I liked all the acts and was educated and entertained.
"Needs better vocals. <SEP> I stumbled across this looking for a different song. Was happy to see a new artist but was very disappointed. The lyrics sound like they would good, the music is basically perfect but the vocals are extremely underdeveloped and weak, even nasal. Do it again with a strong voice and you may have a hit."
"Newer Band de Santa Cruz <SEP> This single best represents, in my opinion, the band so far, just because it
really is a good song and they have been playing live shows recently, that
are beginning to gain them Expendables-Like popularity. I give it 5 stars
because on Amazon's rating scale, a 5 star review means ""I love it!""

The song: Definitely a single. Lyrics fit the music. aaannd, It's cool."
Sunrise <SEP> I heard this song on ABC's Nashville season finale and instantly fell in love with this song. It was a good song!
"""Two Roads"" is my all-time favorite song - ""2 roads diverged in a yellow wood ... <SEP> Michael Shamblin's music softened my hardened heart. Everyone of these songs are straight from the heavens. When I first began visiting Remnant Fellowship, his song ""God's Pain"" flooded my eyes with a million tears thinking about all the pain I had caused God in my life by not fully obeying Him. ""Two Roads"" is my all-time favorite song - ""2 roads diverged in a yellow wood - knowing I could not travel both...all the people that were passing there, I knew they were not the same...this road has made all the difference."" Other favorites: Rely On, Days of Awe, Azaleas, We Serve God, One God & Psalm 1. This music will bring you so much joy and pushes back the spiritual warfare. Can't recommend this enough for daily listening - turn off the bad news and listen to some good news!"
One Star <SEP> ITS HORRIBLE!!!
"Would Do It Again <SEP> I love the sax, for the money I couldn't pass it up. Glad I made the purchase."
"It wasn't what I thought- some songs are a little ... <SEP> It wasn't what I thought- some songs are a little too slow. I listen to the entire cd driving from Cincinnati to Alabama last weekend. Over all, it's a decent ""chill"" at home in the evening with an adult beverage cd."
"don't buy this crap <SEP> it's not the real recordings by the real musicians, its cheap underproduced studio imitation songs.  trust me, don't waste your money."
"Awesome rock, Should have been a hit record <SEP> Saw them in Rodeo California back in the day, Awesome rock, Should have been a hit record. Must Have"
"Great album from local band <SEP> We saw this band as an opening act and was very impressed.  Have been enjoying the CD a great deal.  They have a musical based on this music ""On the Eve"" that we're planning to see in January.  Give this a listen."
"perfectly crafted songs <SEP> I purchased this cd after hearing this live show. First the songs are crafted wonderfully. The lyrics In Rocket are indicative:
'If I die in the Summer I want to be buried
If I die in the Winter I want to be burned
If I die in your arms I want to be put inside a rocket and shot into the sun.'
This whimsy, and excitement pervades the album.

Lead singer Seth Magill's vocals are interesting and haunting. His voice is what might happen if Joy Division's Ian Curtis had spent some time with David Byrne and they had a beautiful musical offspring. I hesitate to compare though, because his voice is unique in the best possible way.
His harmony's are perfect with his wife Shawn, whose piano accompaniment is perfect.

Max Hartman, a local actor and musician is a great drummer, JOHNNY SEQUENZIA plays Mandolin, harmonica
The biggest pleasant surprise is by the step dancing as percussion of Abbey Magill. Seeing this live is better, but is present and meaningful on Paul Williams extremely well produced CD

I struggle to even define a genre. There is a Celtic influence certainly, but the music is ephemeral, other worldly...and best of all immensely listenable.
I love the closing song:
The Blessed Highway
The Blessed Highway is always full....
Indeed"
"Raw moments, without irony, risking to be heard. <SEP> Touch a rare and joyous proximity to the naked beauty of people risking earnestness to give themselves over to what they can't but be.

With passion, precision, and clarity this album will take you through the shoals of your responsible life to find in its craziest unspoken depths the mood and momentum of dreams demanding to be lived."
"Karma <SEP> I have no idea what this is.  It was purchased in 2014, I believe, when this ""girl"" stole from a kid (my daughter) and made a bunch of purchases on her kindle.  It's all good though.  Karma is a B*.  Now, she and her ""baby daddy"" are being sentenced this February 2017 on burglary charges (for another incident).  Hope she enjoyed all these things she got off amazon though! haha"
Must get <SEP> Kevin Gates is the truth. BWA best rap group out there. Get at me 1000. Percy Keith the truth too.
Good drive-time tunes! <SEP> Go Fish has great upbeat praise music the whole family enjoys. This is their best album...We love it! Great for driving.
"From the green fields of France to Guysborough, to the Cliffs of Doneen to Harlan <SEP> Tom Courtney has produced a blend of music from his native Ireland,to Canada's Nova Scotia through Harlan Kentucky and then to Texas.  His style of delivery honors the great song writing art of Darrel Scott, Stan Rogers, Guy Clark, Ron Hynes, and Eric Bogle.  Along with traditional Irish favorites, Jon O'dreams, Rose of Allendale and Cliffs of Doneen.  He paints a mural with his vocals and takes you on an adventure of the senses through time.  A great Album Tom."
Awsome! <SEP> Awsome lyrics and music. He is a very creative and smart and talented played and very sincere. G-d bless him and G-d bless the Jewish People and America
"Age has has it's day..... <SEP> The song Night train by Kadoc is a memory of mine that holds great fun memories dancing and having a blast.  However, since I am a wee bit older these days I don't remember this song to be so fast?  The tempo of this tune makes me feel like I am listening Night Train on speed?  Oh well, so much for recapturing my youth.  Not."
Nicely done! <SEP> Nicely done!
"Docked a star for an unfulfilled promise on the Youtube Music Video. :( <SEP> They didn't include the ""Trouble"" from KRNFX at the end like they said on the music video. Docking it one star because I literally bought the song because I thought that was rad, but it didn't even include it. :( The song's great though."
A must! <SEP> A great redition of a wonderful song! Walk Off the Earth never fails to please your ears.
Absolutely awesome! <SEP> Walk off the Earth is my favorite band! Especially when they cover a song. Their version is always so much better than the original!
"love the group love the way they sing the song <SEP> My daughter and I happened on this group on you tube, we love them and very happy with purchase, awesome."
"WOTE- Wonderful and Talented Group of Musicians <SEP> If you like acappella, this is a refreshing cover of a popular song.  The musicality and ability of the wide variety of members in this band is impressive.  They have a number of videos released out on the internet that I suggest you seek out.
I think it best to award talent by making purchases and buying product in support of those responsible for creating unique reproductions of current music.
AND...KRNFX provides the most awesome beatbox I have ever heard.
I recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music."
"Stunning.  Perfect <SEP> The video on YouTube is absolutely brilliant.  I've watched it so many times already, and I cannot seem to tire of it.  Captivating.  Totally 5-stars.  The music is good enough on its own."
"How to make a mediocre song great <SEP> There is nothing more impressive than taking a mediocre, over-processed Taylor Swift song and rocking it out a capella, and WOTE and Krnfx prove they have the musical chops to do it. One of those covers that tower over the original."
Better than Taylor <SEP> The first time I heard this cover was on YouTube...This is an amazing group. Sarah starts the song then each member of the group comes in on cue. The video is most amazing because it is all done in one take. These guys have a future. I'm glad they are getting exposure on Amazon.
"Terrible! The songs are cut off <SEP> Terrible!  The songs are cut off, some start in the middle of the songs. You will be listening to a song and then all of a sudden it goes to the next song and that one will pick up after it has started.  The sound quality is fine, the records are fine, they just did not record the full songs.  Do not waste your money.

**I amend my review to 2 stars - you have to listen to the songs in order, do not have them on shuffle or they sound cut off because they run continuous.  They still sound cut off and incomplete but they just run one right after the other. It's very weird to listen to.  I would still be wary about spending money on it."
One Star <SEP> Once I bought it I could not download it.
Two Stars <SEP> song
"Super Banda de Nios <SEP> Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to play after the purchase."
One Star <SEP> My twelve year old loves this; too broad of a parody for me. Meh.
Four Stars <SEP> Kipyn's voice is very pure and reminiscent of Judy Collins. The CD is a pleasure to listen to.
"Displays The True Beauty of David's Voice <SEP> This is a beautiful love song made even better by the fact that David sings it so well! Unlike some of his other Pop songs, ""I'll Never Go"" is a smooth ballad that truly shows off David's vocal abilities and maturity as a singer. I enjoy this song so much, I listen to it several times whenever I turn it on. Fans of Josh Groban will love this!"
BRILLIANT <SEP> Trad songs and originals are excellent. S***e n' Onions gets all the thanks for referring me. Waiting for the next album.
"Awesome Young Rocker! <SEP> If you like the Smashing Pumpkins you will absolutely love Matthew Heller.  You don't expect so much raw energy from a kid like this, but he BRINGS it from the first track on!"
"Amazing song <SEP> I've been privileged to hear Tom perform this amazing song of sorrow and hope twice for the late, great Ruth Harvey. Absolutely wonderful!"
Love this! <SEP> Very pure worship! Love the bgv's...perfect fit with Kevin's vocals...Please download your copy. It send you into a place of worship.
Five Stars <SEP> ok
\_()_/ <SEP> hearing this song for the first time in 2016 and it's not very good  \_()_/
Five Stars <SEP> This is A CHH Classic.
"What A Pleasure <SEP> Over the years I have heard many people try to bring forth what they believe in Gospel Hip Hop and outside of the Holy Hip Hop, but these young men have stepped their game up. If you like crew disc like Gallery Drive, Christcentric, Cross Movement, D.N.A., and W.L.A.K. you'll love this new project. Lamp Mode artist have all stood up for the gospel, and here there is no doubt about the mission. I have Stephen the Levite's projects, and Timothy Brindles' newest project, but this is my first project with Zae Da Blacksmith, but bro is bringing it. Love the work fella. 5 Stars"
"So good \m/ <SEP> After waiting forever it was finally released and let me say it was WELL worth the wait! I'm blown away. I knew this would be heavy but wow. I definitely recommend everyone buy this, it's well worth it! Great job Kuza!"
Five Stars <SEP> Gr8 version of this old hymn
disappointing <SEP> Not as good as I hoped
"The Wrong New York <SEP> This is not the ""New York"" form Broadway's ""On the Town."" It is labeled incorrectly. It is ""New York, New York"" that Sinatra made famous."
"Awesome Blues Song <SEP> Her voice, and what Tara does with her voice, are BOTH awesome. She has another version on the Internet, but THIS is the version you want to listen to.
I believe it was a made-on-demand version for the episode of Dallas (the new Dallas) for background music when Sue Ellen starts remembering past events she had with JR and falls ""off the wagon."" I did not hear it there (I did not see that program). I do not know how I ""stumbled"" upon it, but I have been celebrating ever since. I truly believe this could be the ultimate example of a blues song RECORDING. If not, and I learn of a recording that tops this one, I will be blessed again! BUT until then, I will keep replaying this over and over. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Tara."
Buy This Album!!!!! <SEP> I bought this song on a whim because I love Motionless In White especially their heavier stuff and let me tell you this is the heavy side of Motionless In White and I love every second of it :)
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
"Absolutely NOT the original - regardless of the album title. <SEP> Based on the title ""Broadway: The Original"" it would seem that this recording would be from the Original Broadway Cast album - believe me it's NOT. It's a single female average vocalist singing the finale from ""A Chorus Line"". Those familiar with the show and/or original cast album will (or should) be very disappointed in this rather bland pedestrian arrangement of a song that is quite important to the original score. I heard this recording as part of my Amazon Prime membership so it cost me nothing but those having to pay for the download should at least listen to the sample prior to purchase (even at .99 cents it's not a bargain). I sincerely doubt that many people are going to find this rendition worth purchasing, especially those familiar with the show and previous cast recording."
"The sample sounded like the radio version but it is not <SEP> This is a half spanish version so bummed! The sample sounded like the radio version but it is not! Idk if i can return it, but I'm hoping i can."
"Really bad <SEP> The misspelling of ""Highlihts"" on the album cover says it all."
Two Stars <SEP> This just doesn't compare to the original recording.  Salonga and Pryce are so much stronger.
"Terrible Version <SEP> This is not a good version of Miss Saigon.  I was sitting on the couch, having my Amazon Echo play some songs by name.  I requested ""Why God Why"" and got an awful version that upset me enough I got up off the couch to go to my computer so I could write a review.  If you want to listen to Miss Saigon, go find a real cast recording."
"I love this song <SEP> I love this song.  I hate this version.  I only found it accidentally through my Amazon Echo, and had to get up to turn on my computer to write this review."
Five Stars <SEP> Great tones. Isochronic works best for me since I like using my speakers. Also great for meditating.
good selection <SEP> It has a bunch of tracks to choose but each one is less than 10 minutes and loops smoothly on repeat so it dosnt take a lot of space. The songs are also pleasant and well made unlike some brainwave tracks that are awkward.
"GREAT SONG <SEP> Great Song. Great Mantra. Soothing, Meditative, Uplifting, Inspirational, Healing. Everything One Would Look For In A Yoga Meditation Mantra. Worth The Purchase."
"Justified <SEP> Just the right blend of cutting edge and backwoods blues sound. ""The Ballad of Pearl and Roy"" is easily the song I see breaking into the charts as the most popular. My personal favorite however is ""Postal"". Despite the title and some preconceived ideas you might have, this song tells a great story. The other song that has been growing on me lately is ""When the Sun Falls Down"", and the TV series ""Justified"" comes to mind each time I hear it. I can see the writers of the show creating a whole episode around this song. Great album, I can't wait to hear more!"
"This Sucks!! <SEP> This guy, Rob Redding has a radio talk show that sucks and this song sucks with him..  A Non Voilent Negro??  Who would buy this trash??  This guy is a complete joke and if you go to his website you'll find he digs up all the racist black news directed toward blacks but he calls himself an Independent.  This guy is a complete clown but he claims this song is one of Amazon's top 5 songs!!  Completely not!!"
Horrible <SEP> Whoever produced this was tone deaf. Do not buy!  Even my 3 and 6 yr old think it sounds bad and tell me to put on the real songs (Gabriella and Troy! Haha)
"Kendrick Lamar on the track adds value ! <SEP> I heard the original single without Kendrick Lamar and I liked it but since I heard this version, I really like it. Kendrick Lamar is one of those rappers who can rap on anything just about because his style is just that unique. He adds a great bonus for listening to this."
got the wrong version <SEP> I intended to order the original version of the single song without the rapping. I accidentally got this with rapping which I don't like. Waste of my $1.29.
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Electric Kazoo - Into The Great White Open (Independent)
Formerly known as Good Question, the Calgary, Alberta outfit renamed themselves Electric Kazoo and have released a brand new album, boldly entitled ""Into The Great White Open"". Though hardly a household name, the band, Sean Goebel (vocals, guitars, banjo, and programming), Mike McPhail (keyboards and vocals), Andrew Clark (drums) and Brian Snyder (bass, guitars, and vocals), have been doing their best to remedy the situation, through extensive gigging. Regulars on their local scene, they've also toured all over the world, including China, and they're already playing shows in support of they're new release. They're dedicated, that's for sure, and the quality of their material suggests a breakthrough, sooner rather later.

Of course, luck and timing play a major part in the success of any artist, and it will be no different for Electric Kazoo, but there's no doubt they deserve an audience. Goebel's songs are clever and ambitious, and the group plays their upbeat folktronica with equal parts skill and enthusiasm. The collection opens with ""Ambiance""; drummer Clark leads the quartet in various directions and the shared vocals add to the aural intrigue. ""A Spontaneous Departure"" displays a similar quirky outlook, and ""Car Window"" combines late period Richard Thompson with The Icicle Works - which works rather well."
Five Stars <SEP> as good as it gets!
"Banjo should not be there. <SEP> I am not a fan of the banjo that is playing the melody in the Karaoke version of this song.  I have no idea why the banjo was put in there but it ruins
the song in my opinion."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song
"Song Sucks, Not by Dr. Dre <SEP> This is not by Dr Dre..song suck i want my money back!!!"
"I Love Classical Music, This Sounds Nothing Like Bad Intentions <SEP> Okay, maybe I had high hopes for Dr. Dre's Bad Intentions going classical.  After all the song is talking about getting creamed and every over lyric is an expletive, but I can honestly say this piece of music is unidentifiable.  Nice try?"
beautiful song <SEP> This song is so beautiful and sexy! Another amazing job by the multi talented Cody Longo. Quickly becoming my favorite! Loving it!
... music is so relaxing and makes me feel so good. <SEP> His music is so relaxing and makes me feel so good.
"There are a very few songs that I LOVE. This rendition of ""Behold <SEP> There are a very few songs that I LOVE.  This rendition of ""Behold ...""' tigers many fond memories of another (Benedicton)
choir of what seems to be a couple of weeks ago."
"finally, something refreshing from the CA punk rock / post-hardcore scene <SEP> Trial By Fire invokes a sense of yearning, not only for the desire to hear more songs, but also for the past.  It's not to say that contemporary Indie rock and Punk influences aren't part of The Owl and Daylight's sound, its just that you also hear faint echos of bands like Jimmy Eat World, Samiam, Jawbreaker, Jawbox and early Alkaline Trio in their sound too.  The band merges it's tight melodic sound with excellent lyrics, often using symbolic imagery to cover some pretty dark topics, but as dark as the tunnel may be, there is a light at the end... the only problem is that light is a train and the band knows this. This is a solid debut EP for The Owl in Daylight, just wish it were full length.  Let's see where this band takes us next."
"Severly overlooked. <SEP> It's a crime this band and particularly this album are so overlooked and underrated. I have this on vinyl and whenever I play it people comment and ask who it is wanting more. I hope they make something new soon. "" I got a long list of foes, and a shorter list of friends"".  Come back soon ASG. "
Four Stars <SEP> Very Catchy.
"Come Thou Fount a HIT <SEP> I'm a pianist/arranger and was asked to play ""Come Thou Fount"" as close as possible to your arrangement. Now I've played it for several venues and just love it so much. What are the chances of your album being produced as a hard-copy CD AND sheet music?"
"Not sure what this is?? <SEP> The album is far away from The Selecter I know and love. Lots of dance hall rhythms, echo and weak lyrics. I am an ""Old"" SKA fan and appreciated The Selecter as they used to be. I understand that a band has to evolve and move forward but I feel that the band took a big step backward."
Ignore any negative reviews as they are way off the mark <SEP> Ignore any negative reviews as they are way off the mark. Great soundtrack to a great movie.
"Few Admirable Qualities But Mostly Forgettable <SEP> I'm not going to beat around the bush. The Call is a pretty bad movie. The movie has a great concept and it's done very slickly, but in the end the whole ordeal is laughably bad. For some that translates to a fun time at the movies, and I can see how this film can be a fun watch. However, an important thing to note is that the entire movie has to deal with tension. Suspense and tension is what is needed for this movie to survive. The antagonist needs to be menacing too, and unfortunately here he is a laughable pansy that feels like he was plucked out of Scary Movie. The tension and suspense also fall flat. So John Debney in reality doesn't have much to work with. He tries his best to work with what he's got, but in the end it goes nowhere.

The great part about this score is that Debney takes on a heavy synth approach. His synthesizer backup comes in the form of Clay Duncan and Justin Burnett who are great in that field. The score's structure itself is as plain and simple as it gets. There is no depth, no emotion or anything else. The score's sole purpose is to rack up suspense, highlight tension and pump some adrenaline when the film calls for it. Debney succeeds for the most part, but since the film moves at a breakneck speed there is no time for anything to really establish itself. The music is just keeping up with this thrill ride, and at least for me didn't help add anything else that wasn't already there which wasn't much to begin with. On its own the music has some admirable characteristics especially in the final act. Debney really plays with textures and the score almost becomes the sound design of the film. In that respect I did enjoy the listen, but after it was over I already forgot about it.

The Call is nothing special. It doesn't add anything new or give us anything we haven't heard before. Debney does an admirable effort to try and make this an edgy and gritty thriller, but the effort goes wasted on such an empty film. The electronic style of the score was interesting and definitely gave it a unique identity, but the execution sort of falls flat. This is a score worth listening to just to see what a composer like Debney was able to do with the material. Other than that this will be instantly forgettable"
NOT KID FRIENDLY AT ALL - Explicit lyrics included <SEP> If I could give this a negative rating I would.  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR KIDS! These songs are not kid friendly and include explicit lyrics. The songs are not sung by original artists nor sung by kids.
Great Vibe <SEP> I love the song! What a great vibe to it. Very fresh and uplifting. Would recommend to a friend. Download now!
"LABEL IS INCORRECT - PHOTO NOT ACCEPTABLE <SEP> The photographs used in this ad for this CD depicts a musicians who perform in the music are not not credited.  This photograph I believe came directly from my facebook account.  I would like to have the photograph either taken down completely, or if not my husband's face, Ms. Magidou's face and Mr. Athanasiou's face are to be removed from the photograph.  This is my intellectual property, taken without my permission.  Please ask seller who gave them permission to post my photograph.

AND YES, My husband performs some of the music on these credits, he is the main bouzouki instrument and he was known as a record producer at the company these records were made.  However, as he is not credited anywhere I want his image taken down.  He is the bouzouki player who is sitting down on the left when you face the photo and yes he performs on this music but the CD refers only to Theodoros Kavourakis.  The lady in the photo was a special singer that only made two songs on their original label.  She is NOT in any of the songs listed on the CD."
"NOT kid friendly <SEP> My son heard this song on the radio and LOVED it. I figured since it was located in the ""Children's Music"" section here on Amazon it would be clean. WRONG. Pretty shady if you ask me. Thank goodness I listened to the sample."
Five Stars <SEP> Great!
"This is not what it claims to be! <SEP> Listen to the sample before you buy this. This is a low quality, instrumental cover of Rie Fu's ""For You.""

I was so hopeful when I saw it, then so glad I didn't pay for it after listening to the sample.

Come on Amazon! Make Rie Fu's music actually available!"
Great Song! <SEP> This is a great Glee version!  It's one of my favorites to listen to because it's a cover that doesn't try too hard.
Fantastic <SEP> This CD is great. We play it every night for our son and he knows that it's bed time. Very relaxing. One day will be a classic.
"My Daughter Loves This <SEP> Thank you for sending quickly and neatly.  This CD was hard for us to find elsewhere.  It was a Christmas gift that came in the mail at least a month before Christmas.  But, when my daughter listened to it after opening it after Christmas, and it would was a little scratched, you were very kind to send another quickly with no hassles.  We appreciate you!"
"Smooth sailing <SEP> Another solid release from this extremely talented artist. I adore all of the music this artist releases, can't help it, it's gorgeous!

Favorite song from this one: Dream Surfer

Not my #1 favorite album from Delay Trees but it is still a very VERY nice writing."
Five Stars <SEP> I love it and the game
"New but still Tomb Raider <SEP> I'm one who is often suspicious of reboots, but with this game they nailed it. And since music is a key part of any game it must be done just right to fit the mood and style of the game, and in this case they also nailed it.
Since the game is set on an island near Japan I expected Japanese sounding themes and they definitely are present but what surprised me was how they are used. Instead of the stereotypical Hollywood type more of a bell and percussion style is used. When added to the spookier moments of the game, especially when facing wolves or an unknown tomb, almost made me feel like I was in Dead Space.
That said, there are some expected forgettable tracks in this soundtrack and they are played in forgettable moments of the game.
In conclusion, this is worth getting if you love reliving the story of the game without having to actually play it and if you love having music that ends with a definitive triumphant note."
"One Star <SEP> not what I was looking for,  the one I truly wanted was over $50.00==  cant afford that."
"Five Stars <SEP> Carol has great depth in her words and music. She has a great sultry, silliness in her voice."
Five Stars <SEP> I like it
"DONT BUY IT!!! (So its not really what you think... Let me explain what I mean) <SEP> Alright so I search the interwebs high and low and no where is Ruby the Martian found as any of ZEDD's OFFICIAL remixers!! This is actually just a remix some unknown guy made and somehow he (Ruby the Martian) or someone is selling as if it is. You can actually get the song remix for free on soundcloud I believe. So basically its kind of a rip off... HOWEVER!!! I didn't know at the time and it was actually cheaper to buy the CD (this fake thing) instead of actually buying the MP3 version of the Spectrum EP (which by buying the CD you get the MP3 Version free!!!)

However it so longer the case and the CD cost more!!!... please DO NOT buy it!! I know you might think this is some kind of collectible but its not really as in Ruby the Martian did no such collab with Zedd to remix this. PLEASE buy the actually MP3 version of the EP (NO CD VER. of the EP ACTUALLY EXISTS).

The remix is not awful but still Amazon has made a mistake!"
"Most expensive music ever bought <SEP> Wife and I made the big mistake. Our fault for not reading the reviews and being less ignorant. Will not happen again. Next time we'll stick to retail and spend time looking at the packaging that denotes the 5:51 playtime which was CONVENIENTLY LEFT FROM AMAZON's DESCRIPTION.

No more buying music from Amazon!"
"Misleading <SEP> Amazon advertises this as an EP with several tracks, but the product they sent only has one track.  This was not worth $15."
"God's Will <SEP> Very inspiring. I was very blessed by the songs that called us believers to live for God- Called to live Holy,The Fathers Way and The Joshua Generation. A great reminder God does not do our will but we are required to do His. Thank you Dr. Onuzo."
disappointing <SEP> I was looking for Christian praise music in French thinking this would be a good sampler but it sounds amateurish at best with canned music - praise God I found Dan Luiten & excellent Spirit-filled French praise music!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
"Great energy, great arrangements <SEP> At first listen this group sounds like a disorganized group of ruffians (wait a minute... that's part of their name!) singing songs they wrote around a campfire, but further listening brings appreciation for their well-orchestrated fusion of multiple vocal parts over quickly moving music."
"These are not songs !! <SEP> Folks,

Please note that this is an ""Instrumental"" album. I wish Amazon has mentioned that this is Instrumental. I wasted money on this without realizing these are just Tunes :-("
WRONG VERSION <SEP> Thought I was buying her NON mixed song.  DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THIS SONG.
Two Stars <SEP> I'm not much into this style. I meant just to buy the original.
"Great new sound! <SEP> Some soul. Some pop.. Some jazz.. Amazing CD with some incredible singles--
Most notable were ""Greatest Memory"" and the rousing ""Whenever You're Gone"""
Great Talent <SEP> Wow! What a wonderful voice. Her music and lyrics are intoxicating. I love her range and her control. A unique style but makes me think of the of the great jazz and blues singers like Chris Connor. I hope we will get more.
"AVOID THIS ALBUM <SEP> Purchased album. It would not show for download to my devices. Shows as only PRIME. I don't buy something to be able to borrow it!
Contacted Customer Service, only fix was to refund the purchase! Prime Membership is causing issues on downloads OF PURCHASEED ITEMS, no help."
Five Stars <SEP> Absolute Best
I do LOVES Ol' Suzie Q. Saw her at University at Buffalo in her tight black get up & big butt Bertha! <SEP> I love Old Suzie Q!
The worse song of Elissa <SEP> Elissa has to learn to sing the assets of upscale and should not rely on computer repairs to her voice cacophony
"Not the music, but someone talking over it <SEP> This is not the music, it is an explanation of Bach's music. There is no description stating that is someone talking and explaining the music while the music is playing. Very disappointed."
"I can run 48 miles listening to this <SEP> I listen when I'm working out.  Makes me run dozens and dozens of miles, every time!  Thank you, Periphery, for making me (beyond) a world class runner!"
One Star <SEP> music
"Piano is out of tune. <SEP> Do not purchase this. You will be better off just listening to it on Youtube, were the piano that is playing this beautiful piece is in tune. This purchase was a waste of time and money."
Five Stars <SEP> FABLISSBLESS!!!
"Five Stars <SEP> Love, Flo Rida!!"
"I didn't like it that I load a wrong singer...anyway that's my mistake . Thanks, <SEP> Load we'll, sample song is not enough to hear the whole song, however, when I purchased I mistaken a bit not until I hear the whole song the voice is not the original."
"Oops, purchased on accident! <SEP> I bought this thinking it was the version played on the radio by P!nk and Nate Reuss. It's okay, but not what I wanted."
"smooth tunes for your life <SEP> Wake Up Celebration have a knack for creating heady & smooth ""electronic"" music. I find that these tunes seamlessly sound good in both my headphones and my car and heighten the mood of everyday life situations. What makes this group unique, is the fact that, although one could categorize them as an ""electronic"" band, their songs aren't too electronic-y. More often then not, the songs feature masterful guitar work that helps them blend genres and keep their sound grounded.

I would recommend this group for fans of LCD Soundsystem; Grimes; The Field; Liars and Applescal"
I love this new kind of sound. We need more <SEP> I love this new kind of sound. We need more
"MP3 won't download, problem with file <SEP> MP3 won't download, problem with file, Amazon downloader cant add file to Media Player. Junk file not checked out by Amazon. Don't waste your dollar."
"My Favorite Singer! <SEP> Love his music.  A great singer. I hope to get to seehim live sometime.  Watch him do Lonely Teardrops on YouTube.
fantastic!"
"bought the wrong song <SEP> This song is ok, it's not the one I thought I was purchasing, I wanted the version by Serena Ryder, ended up buying the one I wanted and deleted this one from my list."
not the original <SEP> Was very disappointed. Same as other reviewer..thought i was purchasing  serena ryders stompa...not the same and felt cheated. Went ahead andpurchased the originaland was happy withthat..but other purchase felt like a cheap knockoff.
"Not the actual song <SEP> Downloaded this song thinking it was the one I've heard on the radio. It is not. The title is the same, the artist has a very similar name (Sera Riser vs Serena Ryder), but the song is terrible. I guess it is my mistake for not looking at the information more closely, but I feel cheated out of my $.89. Here is the correct song:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stompa/dp/B00BT671UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stompa</a>"
"Fun and driving music, great lyrics - the EP was great, let's hear an LP <SEP> One beauty of this EP is that there are no weak links.

While the EP gets especially strong starting with ""Subtraction by Subtraction"" in its last three tracks, the entire EP offers up enough musical and emotional range that you can match the single to your ever-changing moods.

Folks who enjoy the lyrics of Elliott Smith, Morrissey, and Elvis Costello as I do will enjoy the witty and often trenchant words that overlay and animate this smart pub rock.  This is pub rock plus.

Guitars and keyboards are solid and rocking, and Elizabeth Bracy convincingly sells the bite in the biting lyrics -- as well as the disappointment and hurt.

I will look with interest for more from The Paranoid Style in the future."
"I loved it, but lost it <SEP> I loved it, but lost it. It was online and when I wrote asking for it back I got the run around."
"Overrated. <SEP> I kept hearing all these comparisons to Kendrick Lamar's, ""Section 80"". Since I love that album and appreciated Ab Soul's contribution to it, I bought this one without a listen. It is true, what is said; you play to your competition. Ab Soul's solo performance is mediocre, at best. With embarrassing contributions from artists who have no sting, ""Control System's"" few shining moments are mostly Kendrick Lamar stepping in to save the day. I have tried to listen over and over. If I suddenly get whatever the hype is about, I'll remove this review or modify it. Until then, this is the worst blind purchase I have ever made."
"The Sound/Volume Was Not Up To Pare <SEP> There's a lot of breaks or pauses in the sound.  Otherwise not bad, I do not suggest purchasing even for $0.99."
Five Stars <SEP> Dope song to turn up on them turf bugs
Buyer beware. <SEP> Buyer beware. This is a bootleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.
"Recording of people talking at a concert <SEP> Apparently, this is a recording of a 1966 Beatles concert made with a cheap, portable  recorder by someone standing in the audience.  The actual music sounds as lo-fi as if it's coming from a transistor radio and is barely audible.  As extras you get some interviews and a somewhat amusing acoustic demo of ""She Said, She Said,' but...don't bother.  One star for the professional packaging and artwork, only."
Beautiful waltz! <SEP> Beautiful waltz from a Hallmark Christmas movie!  We listen to it often.  Features a violin solo and I also play violin.
"Yes, I knew Brandy Dalton personally. He's in a couple of family Christmas Photos. :) <SEP> I'm so glad that I found this CD. :)
This is a great way to remember my long time friend and original Drance Member."
great song <SEP> great song
"If You're in a Musical Mood <SEP> I wanted to like this album but just couldn't. It's more Lion King on Broadway Part: X
The stories are intriguing and depressing, so it has that going for it."
Nice tune by the Trees... <SEP> Great song.  Thought I had heard them all...
"Terrific recording of wonderful compositions. <SEP> I've had this and a companion recording of the other three Motets for many, many years. The performances are a capella with the exception of the Lobet den Herrn. They are perfect. The vocal articulations of this extremely difficult works can't be beat. The boys' sound is fuller than what you would hear from an English choir like King's College Cambridge, but it isn't nearly so dark as that of the Vienna Boys' Choir. The intonation is absolutely perfect (they choir uses A-440 pitch). The interpretations are exciting, but not overly romantic. We really don't know what performance is historically accurate, but I'm willing to bet this is close.

In a desert island selection of 50 CDs, these two would easily make the cut."
Wonderful for sure!!! <SEP> the words of this songs will fit anybody life if they just listen to it! This song really touch my heart i just had to have it!!!
Five Stars <SEP> reel good
"bruising rock. rowdy good time <SEP> The Nashville music scene sometimes gets a hard rock kick in the pants.  Kentucky based quartet Ned Van Go simply bludgeons Music City with its fifth release, ""Lost in the Trouble."" The bruising band  ""shares the common bond of southern, small town guys (plus one Yankee) marked for life by boredom, desperation and a 12-pack of cheap beer put to good use."" The raucous, clever, 11-song auditory assault  opens with the scorching Hog Rock Road, an ode to back-country meth labs. Songwriter Ned Hill draws on experiences from his hometown Horse Cave, KY. (pop. 2,252). Themes range from disinterment to the hilarious skewed mathematics of 1000 Dollar Car. Featured guests include Dan Baird (Georgia Satellites), Warner Hodges (Jason and the Scorchers) and Robert Kearns (Bottle Rockets/Lynyrd Skynyrd).
The album downshifts only once for the Orbison-esque duet with Stacie Collins, Moon Shine On You.
Hill said, ""We weren't out in the sticks and we weren't out in the mountains sitting on the porch playing that kind of music. We were getting our influences from everywhere, from AC/DC to Creedence.""  With the addition of Bob Grant's (Bad Livers) heavy handed Les Paul, Ned Van Go rocks as hard as any metal band in their 80s heyday, (sometimes overextending with effects to the point of dissonance) However, the aggression remains complimentary to the overall tone) His heavy chord work on the thrash metal breakup song, Where Ya Gone Virginia, makes it as aptly categorized as either metal or punk.
On Lost Factory Song,"" Hill sings,
  ""She likes tequila shots and Toby Keith;
Sings a little outta tune through her missing teeth.""
 The album  is short on finesse and long on kick ass.  Just like rock n' roll should be.
Producer Michael Webb (John Fogerty, Poco, and Gary Allan) keeps the mix raw and minimal. Their booking contract should contain a standard indemnity clause in the vein of ""Book this band at your own risk. They may burn your venue to the ground.""

"Where can I get a copy of Feist's version of Closing Time??? <SEP> I agree with the other reviewers here- the film was phenomenal, but so much good music is not on this soundtrack!

Specifically Feist's version of Cohen's Closing Time... I would pay about 10 bucks for this song alone at this point, what is the hold up with the release of this!"
"Damn it, I just finished the movie and practically ran to the computer <SEP> What a great soundtrack. But what IS the point if none of the great music from the movie is on this CD? Thanks for the heads up to the other reviewers, so I don't have waste my money."
"Not A Soundtrack Album. Huge Disappointment. <SEP> When a movie soundtrack CD is sold as representative of the movie's music, and all the pop-music that was intrinsic to the soundtrack is absent, then the product is misleading. Of the fifteen (15) songs, including the title track ""Take This Waltz"" by Leonard Cohen, which were represented in the film and which fans of this film have been waiting for, ZERO were included in this release. This collection of tracks is nothing more than ambient movie score by Jonathan Goldsmith. If you wanted the soundtrack album, this ain't it. If you wanted a music score, there are much better ones than this. Huge disappointment."
"No Feist <SEP> I think most folks would agree that a ""Take This Waltz"" soundtrack without Feist's version of  ""Closing Time"" is pointless."

one of my newest favorite singer <SEP> What is the to say about her beautiful voice. Went bought her cd after listening to parting glass
"Merry go round <SEP> I liked the title of this song, the lyric catchy and followed up with follow your arrow, almost daring to touch on today's situations facing us."
Five Stars <SEP> Good Christian music I love it
"A Touching Ode to Friendship <SEP> Great song that I had forgotten was connected to the movie ET.  Still it seems the song has another deeper meaning.  Michael Jackson again at his best, touching at the heart of humanity."
Yin-Yang-see the good stand out from the bad <SEP> Need a cloudy day to see a silver lining. Can't argue with the lady. Just love her voice!
"Uplifting and fun <SEP> Kacey Musgraves has a way with simple and uplifting imagery, and I find ""Silver Lining"" a fun and calming song to listen to when I've had one of ""those"" days. She proves you can make country that's not too twangy but not just another flavor of pop."
"Five Stars <SEP> Love the show, love the music."
Easy to listen to. <SEP> Great song/remix. I love finding cool songs on TV shows.
"Interesting version of a great song <SEP> The Dactyl Remix of ""Warm Shadow"" is mainly an instrumental alternative version of Fink's fantastic song heard on the Walking Dead series. I like this version of it but I actually prefer the original version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warm-Shadow/dp/B0053TRX26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warm Shadow</a>), not to mention the live version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warm-Shadow/dp/B008YKWXMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warm Shadow</a>) over this one.

It's not entirely true that it's an instrumental track as the vocals are still present in the song but rather than have the lyrics sung throughout the track, they've been rearranged in such a way that they bookend a stretch of uninterrupted music from the song. At the end of the song, the lyrics come back in but they don't feel natural and feel like they were cut-and-pasted into the finale in a hurry. It's still a really good song but after hearing the original and live cuts so many times, I can't help but notice the differences between them. If you liked the song on the show, I recommend downloading the original song (or even the entire album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Darkness/dp/B0053TRVVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Darkness</a>&nbsp;since it's pretty excellent as well) before downloading this one."
"Not the metal version you heard on YouTube. <SEP> Found a cool video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qu7qvRFWWM) featuring a metal version of The Walking Dead theme and saw the purchase this song on Amazon. Thought cool, I bought it and was disappointed to find out that I wasted .29 cents on this techno remix."
"Lame! <SEP> I was looking for the ORIGINAL main title theme and the only thing I could find is this poorly put together, tacky, horrible sounding electronic remix version. I'm sorry but I'm disappointed. Amazon needs to find the original and out it out there for us to buy. Do not buy."
"Buyer Beware: Not the main theme from the show. <SEP> Not the same track used as the theme. Remix is tacky, and typical of today's electronic remixes. If you are looking for the TV theme that is played in the show's open, look elsewhere!"
Five Stars <SEP> Music!
The chance to have my son . . . <SEP> Classic
Love the song <SEP> Love the song. Knew it was live but there is so much screaming from the fans it is difficult to enjoy the music.
"He is the King of merengue and bachata <SEP> I will call Juan Luis Guerra the King of Merengue ,Bachata and even play an outstanding Salsa.
If you want to hear Music that gets to your soul you can't go wrong with this extraordinary artist from Dominican Republic."
"Gracias Chico Mann! <SEP> I love all the tracks and guest vocals...especially #2,#5,#7,#8,#9 and #11. My rule of thumb is when you like more than 5 or 6 tracks from a album then go ahead and buy it. Thus, I completely recommend it! Also,thanks to the seller, oliverfoxcollection, for delivery me a great deal within 13 days, just before my birthday. What a way to celebrate it with great tunes to dance to and share with family and friends. ""Lovebird Express"" sends you all the prosperity you deserve."

Best track <SEP> The best track on this album
"This MP3 fades into the next track and then cuts out. <SEP> I love the song. It is dreamy and well-layered.

However, the MP3 fades into the next track and then cuts out.

Listen: I wanted to buy one whole song, not one truncated song + five seconds of the next track.

After buying, I checked the webpage on bandcamp. The song is supposed to be 3:41s, not 3:32s.

I've waited months for this track to become available, so I don't have to buy the silly 7in LP, which I don't have a player for.

Now I have an incomplete product."
Golden Sun Streaming <SEP> Beautiful recording of a beautiful performance.  One of my favorite pieces of Bach for voice. I think of it just about every morning of my life and this is a beautiful soundtrack!
Perfect for Mediation or Relaxing <SEP> This album is perfect for mediation. It is soothing and with enough variety in the individual tracks so that it is not monotonous. The music allows you to focus without distraction.
Highly Recommended for Pleasure and/or Pedagogy <SEP> Superb selection of pieces for listening pleasure and for pedagogical purposes if you or a loved one is leaning to play.
Five Stars <SEP> Rock on!
"This is one of the best Christian albums out <SEP> This is one of the best Christian albums out.  I wish he would come out with a new album; it's been a while.  I love his lyrics and flow, and he is all about exalting Christ.  He is very skillful lyrically."
"I Absolutely Love this Cd <SEP> I absolutely love this cd, if you love or know her song Every time we touch you will love this cd. I know I really love Cascada and her music, she has such an amazing voice and her songs are fun :)"
"P.O.S. <SEP> This sounds like some kid banging on a cheap second hand Casio keyboard. Honestly, my little dog bolted from the room. I may never regain his trust."
"I'll Give it Two Stars for Effort.... <SEP> I'm normally not one that will give a bad review on items, but this free album offered by Amazon for ""Transmissions,"" sucks.  It's just a bunch of noise, the various sounds being used in each track aren't even in sync with each other so it grates your nerves (like nails on a chalkboard)  I will give the artist 2 stars for the effort, but there really is more to dance tracks than white, purple, green and blue noise.

Don't even waste your time...."
Five Stars <SEP> Great fun

great song! <SEP> this is an excellent song about fully surrendering yourself to God and His will for your life. I definitely recommend it!
"A low for an otherwise great artist <SEP> El Guante is a very talented talented rapper out of the Minneapolis. His Albums ""Haunted Studio Apartment"" and ""Conscious is not enough mixtape"" are great. This album however is horrible. I don't know if he thought he was being creative or what, but half the tracks are just instrumentals with a few words added, and those tracks with lyrics are mainly of See more. The album should really be called See More Perspectives moves into El Guante's haunted studio apartment, Guante is only in a few of the tracks, or if he is in the track his voice is unrecognizable, I don't know which. In short this album is not worth the money, don't waste your time. If you haven't listen to Guante before though, definitely download his two albums mentioned above. The mixtape still might be free on his website."
"This music is not what it seems <SEP> While this album might be pretty to listen to, its title is completely deceiving as to its nature; it is called ""Tibetan Folk Songs"", but anyone looking at the cover can see only Chinese writing there.  Instead of truly traditional work and dance songs, the titles and lyrics of these tunes are entirely a Chinese construct, with painful titles such as ""The Brilliance of Chairman Mao"".  Since the brutal occupation of Tibet by the Chinese government since 1959, the Chinese government has been attempting to cover up the horror of their actions by celebrating their ""ethnic Tibetan"" heritage.  Beautiful traditional Tibetan dances, songs, attire, and sacred locations are made into folly when they are replicated and performed or displayed for tourist's eyes and ears, such as the Chinese Ethnic Minority Park, which boasts a fake Potala Palace and Chinese citizens dressed as Tibetans, performing ancient folk dances.  All this rant is trying to say is, this CD is not what it seems.  It is covering five decades of sorrow with feel-good lyrics, trying to convince you that everything is perfectly happy in Tibet.  Think carefully before supporting this CD and label."
"Another Awesome song by Faroo Munammad. <SEP> Love this song....  Remember  Safety First.  Stay Alert, Stay Safe, Stay Alive!!"

Solid volume! Great tracks from all labels included. Energy is high, tracks are fast, and many fun para para routines choreographed by SEF & Star Fire."
"Not the best, but still good <SEP> Sadly, this has to be my least favorite song on the album. I can't really explain why I don't like it much, but some thing about it rubs me the wrong way... I have to be in the mood to listen to it, but regardless of all that, it still has killer vocals and cool lyrics, so any one can appreciate the song. I sadly give it a 2, and it hurts my soul a bit."
"Disappointing <SEP> I don't care for this track.  Kind of annoying.  Too bad, because I love at least a couple of the other tracks on this album.  The ending is kind of nice, though."
"GARBAGE <SEP> CHEAP MATERIAL, FLIMSY AND NOT WORTH IT. CAN FIND A BETTER MATERIAL IN WALMART-DONT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT...LOOKS LIKE IT IS MADE FOR A KIDS WAIST!"
"Steer Clear of this Music if You Love The Piano <SEP> Where do I start in telling you I was not pleased at all after I bought these songs. Not at all.

Essential Piano Movie Collections AND animated movie songs are basically the same albums played by the same person WITH AN EXTREMELY HEAVY HAND. If you like listening to someone POUNDING on the piano keys and getting it TECHNICALLY CORRECT, this are the albums for you! There is almost no piano finesse on the album.

The pianist has virtually no finesse when it comes to making the piano ""sing."" It sounds like all these songs were recorded quickly in one session to get it over with because it was too expensive to be in the studio. HOW SAD.

The rhythm is incorrect on several songs (at least they did not follow the rhythm of the songs recorded by the ""OFFICIAL"" recordings by Disney). I doubt that the pianist ever used the sustain or damp pedal during the recordings and it sounds like it. Like: Under The Sea and A Whole New World. They are played also without syncopation.

I mainly bought the collections for Disney tunes and ""The Merry Go Round Broke Down,"" From ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""
And GUESS WHAT??? That's NOT the song on the album!! (Essential MC Vol. 5) The song is: HUNGARIAN RHAPSODY (DUELING PIANOS). How anyone can make such a mistake is beyond me. And there is no good piano version of ""Merry Go Round Broke Down on Amazon.com OR iTunes.

So there you have it. I spent $28.00  for lousy music. My fault, actually. I should have listened more to the music before I purchased the albums. Because when I downloaded them, they all sounded the same in piano styling... POOR.

This review is actually for Essential Piano Movies Collection Vol. 1, Vol. 4, and Vol. 5"
"Mr Gallagher & Mr Sheen <SEP> Music only, no words.  Not identified as such on album.  I was looking for the complete version, with words. Music OK."
"Breaking the cycle of the 3rd album jinx. <SEP> I gave this album a 5 due to the fact that it is unquestionably the most well produced album they have put out to date. While it is a little short, there is no denying the quality recording for each track. WCS has also taken on a new lead singer for the album which, admittedly at 1st bummed me out. I really liked the last one. But by the middle of the 1st track I got over that. This guy is freakin' awesome! The only complaint I have, if even you wanna call it that, is the recycling of previously released songs. Well, one in particular,  Forsaken Abomination. Which is now renamed Forsaken. But to this I liken it to Dethklok's Mermaider & Mermaider II. Both are incredible songs that sound much the same while managing to possess individual identities. It's not better, but it is  a welcome addition to the band's track list. And with that said. If you do not have a Walking Corpse Syndrome album yet, but dare to call yourself a true metal head. Then honestly speaking, this is a great jumping on point for new listeners.  The earlier entries are not as well  produced and don't have the same vocalist. But in my opinion is well worth the listen none the less."
Five Stars <SEP> Very talented group... Hope to see more of them in the near future.
"Ella is my absolute favorite singer, ever <SEP> Ella is my absolute favorite singer, ever. This album features a lot of earlier recordings, she sounds quite young. It helps round out some of my collection because it has songs I didn't have before, and I love hearing how her voice evolves over time. Even young she has an amazing tone and such beautiful control over her voice. I'll never get tired of hearing Ella. <3"
Five Stars <SEP> G4eat song. Moves me to tears!!!
Five Stars <SEP> great as all her music
Boring <SEP> I am disapointed. this song is too repetative. it doesnt have any significant meaning. i expect more from lana del re
"Five Stars <SEP> Awesome Level 42 tune, great bass by Mark King"
Desire <SEP> Seductive and beautiful.
Four Stars <SEP> good erotic tune
"""Tower of Song"" , Great Job Tom Jones!!! Bravo !! <SEP> Tower of song , Great job Tom Jones!!! Bravo !! This is a great version of ""Tower of Song "" I am so familiar with Leonard Cohen singing this song that I was so surprised to hear Tom Jones come so close to L.C."
Two Stars <SEP> different but not even worth the .99 cents
Five Stars <SEP> Just a Great Album for me.
"Kathy Taylor Cd <SEP> Awesome.  It is great music and she helps you get into the presence of God.
I would recommend this CD"
Happy Customer <SEP> Simply put.....AWESOME!  I LOVE THIS  CD BY KATHY TAYLOR.  IT ALWAYS USHERS ME INTO A PLACE OF PRAISE AND ULTIMATE WORSHIP!
mnbates <SEP> Kathy Taylor is by far one of the most underated gospel singers around. I absolutely LOVE her voice...one of the best there is!
"It's nothing more than just noise! <SEP> I am a huge fan of The Carpenters and I buy anything associated with their name for my collection.  Unfortunately, there was nothing melodic about this song, if you can call it music.  If you like The Carpenters give it a try.  But I can't recommend it."
Enjoy <SEP> Enjoy
"How Do You Think I feel by Elvis Presley <SEP> I bought this song by Elvis Presley TWICE from iTunes and it was defective both times.  The words are garbled near the end of the song.  I then bought the song on Amazon thinking I could get a good copy with a different vendor.  Wrong.  It was defective, too.  I bought this song 3 times and yet do not have a single good copy.  How Do You Think I feel?"
Five Stars <SEP> Great cd Russell Tompkins jr. Is the best!
"Chants with noise <SEP> I'm unable to discern the thunderstorm. This sounds like just a poor recording of the chants, with quite a bit of background noise."
"sweet hard rock song! <SEP> Pretty melodic rock song. I don't really like females vocals, but this one is an exception! You guys should play more :)"
"Auld Lang Syne by The Stylistics <SEP> This version of Auld Lang Syne is my favorite vocal version of the song. It has joy,  a sharing spirit and wonderful voices!"
"Too Long To Just Be Disappointed <SEP> Doesnt have the music (those old, great songs) heard in the movie. It was all music, no singing at all. 

AND it took from Aug 30 to Oct 24 to get it! "
One Star <SEP> This does not have the songs from the movie on it. It's just the orchestra music.
Not what I expected <SEP> I was disappointed in the soundtrack. I thought it was going to be songs I heard  from the movie. The movie had some cool 70's songs but instead it was like muzak!
"Instrumental only, no songs <SEP> Buyer beware. This is only the instrumental score and not the full soundtrack of songs played during the movie. Very disappointing as I was looking for and expecting both."
great product for the price! <SEP> sent this cd soundtrack to my niece as a christmas gift and she loves it
Not the OST but the SCORE... If ... <SEP> Not the OST but the SCORE... If you don't have the OST then the SCORE should not come up in the search engine.
"I thought it would be the really cool songs from the movie <SEP> I thought it would be the really cool songs from the movie, instead it was background music! What a rip-off!"
"Great meditation music <SEP> I just want you to know that I'm a Misty fan anyway. She is one of the most Godly women i know. She professes God and Jesus in her life,and lives that way. Great meditation music,and the Spirit just takes you away. I would recommend this for anyone."
"I can't believe this album ever got released. <SEP> This Stereo  Vinyl LP was released by Hilltop JS-6064 ,probabbly sometime in the late 60's or 70's. There is no date on the album nor the album cover. The notes on the back of the cover don't tell much ,and talks about all the great choices a kid has upon entering a candy store and compares that to the choices on this album.
 There are 15 tracks on the album ,but no reason given why they were chosen .A few are well known by the stars who made them hits. Then there are some lesser known songs by famous artuists,but they were never big hits for them or anyone. Then there are several lesser known songs by ,to put it gently,virtually unknown artists. In all the songs, the quality of the tracks is so poor that I had a hard time believing that they were sung or played by the artists involved.
 To be frank,thisalbum  has nothing about it that would impress any Country Music fan;and I am lost in trying to come up with any reason why it was even released. There may be some song or one tha'ts hard to find by either a famous or lesser known artist;that one is looking for....but I doubt it.
  Tracks on the album are;
  IT HAS TO BE ALWAYS .........Glen Campbell
  SEND ME THE PILLOW YOU DREAM ON..................Hank Locklin
  WALKINH AFTER MIDNIGHT  ..................Patsy Cline
  ELECTRIFIED DONKEY.................Ferlin Huskey
  ABOVE ND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY.............Wynn stewart
  DONE ROVIN'................Johnny Horton
  SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD................Dave Dudley
  MISTY BLUE..........Jerry Smith

  JUST BUMMING AROUND............Jimmy Dean
  HOT ROD LINCOLN...........Charlie Ryan
  ACE IN THE HOLE........Stewart Hamblen
  JACK THE LUMBERJACK.........Hal Willis
  JUST OUT OF REACH.........The Stewart Family
  GEORGIA RAG........Webb Pierce
  FANCY PANTS  Floyd Cramer"
"need moar songz <SEP> The music is fine but there were only two songs...howvus that an album,"
"Old material....very disappointing <SEP> I absolutely loved their first album. ""Rain"" and ""Long Way Home"" really showcase this band's talent and ability to cross several musical boundaries. I hadn't heard anything from this band in years. I just happened to see this album was released this year, so I checked it out. After 6 years, all they could muster was remixes of their old songs? I am very disappointed, to say the least. Definitely not worth spending the money to buy. Great singer, awesome musicians, you'd think they could do more than this."
"Only 30 seconds long <SEP> Really thought this was the whole song, why would anyone want just 30 seconds of a song?  You can buy the whole song for the same price, really disappointing.  I guess this 30 seconds is super special and is worth the same as the whole song?  I just don't get it."
"Fantastic song! <SEP> <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-We-Meet/dp/B007GG5826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where We Meet</a>It is an amazing song. The music and the lyrics  match perfectly.
Fantastic song: Satellite by Tyrone Wells."
"Essentially a CD Single <SEP> AIURa was a 4-frame comic series transformed into a 4 minute anime series. The OP and ED songs were great, with the ED sounding like a well done school anthem. This CD has four tracks, and only one of them is one I was interested in.

Track 1. Extended version of the AIURa OP.
Track 2. Unrelated song. Title .... which my dictionary tells me is something unlimited
Track 3. Karaoke version of Track 1
Track 4. Karaoke version of Track 2

If this had only two tracks, the OP and the ED, and no karaoke or extras, I'd have given it four stars, at least.
As it is, Track 1 was very good, and maybe worth the import price if you _have_ to have it."
Not as good as the real IZ. <SEP> Sorry but I wouldn't recommend it.  Do yourself a favor and get the real IZ from Hawaii.  Sorry I didn't!
music good vocals OMG <SEP> I liked the music it worked well with my running. The vocals sounded like verybad Karoke! The female could not carry a tune.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful
incomplete <SEP> Not the entire song. There are complete versions available for less money. Be sure to compare length of song before buying.
"Very poor sound quality <SEP> The Sound Quality On this CD is very poor, avoid this Cd."
"Live in San Diego <SEP> I am a huge Alice Cooper fan, and I was actually at this particular concert in San Diego. Sadly, the recording quality is extremely poor. This CD could have been great, but sounds as if it was recorded on a vintage 1979 hand held recording device ...not professionally!"
"poor sound quality <SEP> I love Alice but this recording doesn't cut it. Alice sounds bad, can't reach the high notes and kind of just growls and talks the lyrics."
Four Stars <SEP> Big daddy kane with a live band. It gets no better
"Amazing album! <SEP> Great listen, especially if you like bands such as Astrobrite, King Black Acid, and the more ethereal side of My Bloody Valentine"
"don't download! <SEP> I gave it one star because the singing is horrible, there is a deep English accent, and some of the songs were really boring. There are much better toddler song options out there!"
One Star <SEP> Not a very good remix.
"Underground Hip Hop at it's finest <SEP> Great album. I started to type ""Alchemist has been on a roll lately"", but that would imply that he's had down time? Dude is still consist with great beats/production.  He's added more guitar licks to his production, but it's still the sickness that makes him an underground great.  With lyricists like Planet Asia and Phil Da Agony dropping verses, this is that classic stuff.  The stuff you used to have playing in the background when your boys would come over to get destroyed on Madden, NBA Jams/Live/2K, Call of Duty.  As you may have guessed, I like it."
"MASSIVE <SEP> This is a massive and somewhat amazing amalgamation of songs.

But what makes it special is the sheer size of the set.  Two Whole Disks!"
sun! <SEP> sun is a great song from belinda! i've loved her ever since the 80s.if you love belinda then you'll love this! now belinda we need a whole new cd!!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this band and album!
Awesome song <SEP> Awesome song!  I love Shane. I hope he continues to make music even tho he's so busy with everything else.
Five Stars <SEP> Heard this one on TV had to have it! !
"Not my kind of music <SEP> When they say explicit, boy do they mean it.  First song borders on offensive.  Not my kinda thing."
"A wonderful song! <SEP> I loved it as a child, and I love it today! The whole album is a treasure for anyone who loves Belafonte and Christmas!"
"Not bad, but not the best. <SEP> Some of these re-recorded versions aren't bad, but no as good as the original. Includes some George Jones songs Paycheck recorded toward the end of his career. I bet he had the time of his life playing and re-recording some of his songs with these unknown band members."
"Fantastic ! <SEP> I discovered this artist on U-Tube. The complexity and richness of this and other compositions by this artist in compilation with other
artist is truly unique, and enriching. His music is international and draws inspiration from many different cultures, and melds those
into a harmonious mix that draws you into arrangements that are a truly enveloping music experience. I recommend you seek other
releases by Gino Goss they are all special and uniquely different, however Egyptian Drifter has become my mantra, I thirst for it daily."
"Another awesome compilation from Monstercat! <SEP> I really love this album.  It features music from some of my favorite Monstercat artists, and as usual, it doesn't disappoint.  This album has a great mix of electronic music genres including drum and bass, dubstep, and more.

I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves good electronic music."
"Pete's voice still rings out, and a good thing too. <SEP> How can you not love someone who sings an ode to this material. It's not new. I don't know how many years ago I heard it on vinyl and I love it still."
"Great recording, terrible editing. <SEP> There are several digital glitches and hard edits that mar the first piece. The second begins with Kahn and the tabla player tuning up for a while before beginning the rag. As a musician I don't mind this much but it could just as easily have been edited out. It's a shame, the sound recording and playing are excellent, but this transfer to mp3 didn't receive the attention to detail it deserved. I won't buy vol. 6 because this one. Luckily, Ali Akbar Khan has many other recordings to choose from. 2 stars reflect this product, not the musicians."
Sucks <SEP> It's even worse live. Bummer album and even worse singing. A better idea of what to do with your money is to just throw it away.
Love connection <SEP> I love this song Love Connection by Raheem Devaughn but the song never did appear on my kindle fire after purchase!
Good R&B singer <SEP> I had heard of Raheem DeVaughn for a while but didn't buy anything by him until I heard this track.  The track has a nice urban contemporary beat that makes you rock in your seat while his smooth vocals weave through the rhythm.
"bummer you have to buy the whole cd for one song! <SEP> C'est la vie is a great song, I would love to use this version but I had to buy the one off the dancing hits cd, which isn't the same since it adds a bunch of synthesizer parts."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song and this group. They have a touch of God on them.
"Unforgettable Again !!! <SEP> Wow---the guys finally got their second album out !!! Now lets hope they keep them coming... If you haven't heard of Last Amanda, you need to lend an ear. If you like great song structure, great melodies, & a little power pop thrown in for good measure, these guys will more than satisfy you.  Seriously, these guys write songs as well as Dave Groh or the Roland brothers. Think Foo Fighters, Collective Soul, Breaking Benjamin etc....great stuff....From their 1st album, the song ""Unforgetable"" was well---unforgetable, a totally fabulous song, you will never forget. Now on this album they have done it again with ""Years Of Isolation"". This is an absolutely amazing song !!!!!  If there ever was a song that I would call ""perfect"", Years Of Isolation would be it....The only knock I have, is the original version, that was on their MY Space site, was stronger. They evidently pulled it when the new album came out, & replaced with the newer version. The version on this album is stll great, but I would say a 9.5 compared to a 10 on the original. As a matter of fact, if any of the guys in the group read this review, I encourage them to put both versions on their My Space page. Too bad you guys are from so far away. Hopefully, one day you will tour the southwest USA. If so I will be there, & so should anyone else wanting to hear a really fabulous band.....Keep up the great work guys ~~~"
"Colorful Telemann overtures with unique view into Telemann's use of wild Polish folk music <SEP> Several aspects of the Arte Suonatori group, led by Martin Gester, set it apart from other recordings of Telemann's overtures. No. 1 for me is new data on the wild Polish folk fiddlers and bagpipers in what I assume must have been the Tatra mountains. They inspired some of Telemanns most exciting music.

But first some technology. The recording is a SACD Hybrid. Whats that? For those not up on the acronym, SACD means Super-Audio Compact Disk. Its a disk with two layers, one for conventional CD players, and a second with 4.7 gb capacity for special players. The higher capacity permits greater fidelity and depth of sound for audiophiles. You won't experience this unless you have the special equipment (and I dont). By the way, this makes me ask whats with U.S. music-audio development? The SACD system was invented by Sony and Phillips, and the U.S. records relatively little classical music at all these days compared with the Europeans.
Next are liner notes by Dr. Carsten Lange from the research center and publishing house for music by George Philipp Telemann  (Zentrum fr Telemann-Pflege und Forschung) in Magdeburg. This sophisticated Polish groups recording goes farther in tracking the wild Polish mountain fiddlers and bagpipers that fascinated Telemann than any previous recording   to my knowledge. The liner notes even shows the first image I hve seen of the folk musicians, a woodcut of 1693.  He got acquainted with Polish mountain folk musicians as a 24 year old -year old accompanying the 22-year old Count Erdmann from Promnitz in visits to the latters Silesian estates (now Poland).

 Two of the colorful overtures in this set, the Concerti Polonois in D and G major, incorporate style elements from this folk music, that Telemann repeatedly exploited in his subsequent career. As a big fan of Telemann I have always marveled at his pioneering use of folk music in his composition. When he was active with Erdmann (1705-1708) and later folk music was considered low and not suitable to be drawn on for formal composition. But the success and popularity he achieved in every musical endeavor evidently developed in him a rock-like self esteem that allowed him to ignore prevailing attitudes and experiment with all kinds of musical creation.

The highly proficient Arte Suonatori group wants to strike a middle ground between attempts at using period performance and living tradition interpretation. How can one resist pieces like the JOINTS overture,   Ouverture, Jointes dune Suite tragi-comique in D major, TWV55:D22,
Including movements like  Le podagre  arthritis, lhypocondre,  etc? Personally, I feel that Telemanns pre-romantic and, quirky shifts of mood and humorous flights  are better served, if we want to reach beyond expert audiences, if musicians use modern instruments and a more unbuttoned style. But Ill rate this project 5 for its extraordinary qualities."
Five Stars <SEP> love the song.
Crapola <SEP> Crap Crap crappy and Crappies.  I cannot find any redeeming value in this album.  I love to be entertained but this was just crapola.
Two Stars <SEP> Sent back by mistake
Not worth buying unless your in church or a Pastor <SEP> If your in a church leading as a pastor it may have been more helpful. To me It mainly talks about what he is doing for his church and nothing on the subject of how to be a better leader or grow more in leadership
"TRACK LISTING <SEP> TRACK LISTING:
1. Sassy Samba

3. Guitar Improvisation
4. All The Things You Are
5. Is That So
6. I Waited For You
7. Move To The Groove

Two Stars <SEP> there's hardly and songs on this CD...wish I would have researched a bit before buying...
"This completely sucked! Four songs total and a lot of talking <SEP> This completely sucked! Four songs total and a lot of talking. No wonder why they don't list the tracks.
For the price and only 4 songs, a complete ripoff."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent
"Good but... <SEP> I bought this album on amazon mp3. I don't like how it breaks up. It's a Dj mix, so the songs blend into one another. Its an album download. You can hear the tracks change & that ruins the groove. That's my only complaint about this album. I love the beats. I downloaded vol. 2  & it's perfect! It's a non- Dj mixed version. Which means the songs end & begin. Please make more non-Dj mixed versions for those who buy album downloads. Keep the Dj mixed versions for those who buy CDs. Thank you very much! God bless..."
"Profoundly moving <SEP> This CD contains gorgeous renderings of these autumnal works, both in the rich sonority and in the structuring of each piece and the overall arch of each opus. A pleasure to hear, again and again. Highly recommended."
"A little Too Religious <SEP> I think this latest Springfield CD should be listed under Christian Rock.
I really like cuts 2, 3 and 4, those are what I expected from the entire
CD but the rest of the songs have a number of religious references.
It appears that Springfield has become somewhat of a Bible Thumper
and it comes out in his newer music.  I like my Pop/Rock without religion!"
One Star <SEP> This is a live version and I don't like live versions of any song
"When does twerking have anything to do with Bioshock Infinite? <SEP> There have been several raps put out in celebration of this game, but htis one is by far the most confusing (if not more than the game itself.) While it contans most of the same stuff from the others, it throws in modern references that don't connect at all and stick out like a sore thumb. I'm not sure I agree with how the artist saw the game. Overall, it was just not that entertaining."
Two Stars <SEP> it didn't do anything for me
Another great hit from Phil <SEP> Phil has a unique way of making songs. This one is very recognizable as one of his. It has that great tunes feel.
"get  ya started <SEP> I have always enjoyed upbeat music, and this is a good ""get ya started"" type.  Great to listen to when your headed to work, and it helps to motivate you to get there!!!!"
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
Two Stars <SEP> Sucks
"hate it <SEP> thought it was the radio version, was disappointed to discover it wasn't. but it was still ok just not what I thought I had purchased"
"Soothing stuff <SEP> Having bought this a few years ago on Trace Recording's web site, I had admittedly forgotten about it, but I recently came across it in my library. I thought I'd write a short review seeing how nobody has done so as of yet.

Anyways, this is soothing stuff. Think sort of acoustic ambient, with little textures that add flavor to the minimalistic sound. The use of reverb gives songs a space to live in, and envelop the listener with a warm sort of atmosphere. It's great music to fall asleep to, to relax to, or to study to.

I remember putting this stuff on back in high school in the early morning when the sun wasn't quite up yet, and before I knew it, it was over. Sure, the album is 40 minutes, but it really sucks you in and sort of makes you lose track of time.

Anyway, in conclusion, I personally find this a hidden gem in the genre of ambient music. So many people talk about the work of Gas and Eno, and while they are fantastic artists as well, I find it a bit sad smaller groups such as these seem to not have the recognition they deserve due to the genre of ambient being fairly saturated with people just using programs to make all of the sound. This is definitely not the case with Rome Pays Off. The acoustic element adds so much to the sound.
If you want some calm soothing music, I highly recommend it."
Shinyribs! Going to see him this weekend! <SEP> Shinyribs!  Going to see him this weekend!
"Shinyribs puts a smile on my face <SEP> Every once in a while I run into a band that makes we wonder: How did I miss this? How could this great music be out there without me -- or much of anyone else -- knowing about it?

I don't know the answer to that, but I'm glad I stumbled across Shinyribs in the advance material for an upcoming folk festival. This music puts a smile on my face and a bounce in my step. It's everything from honky tonk to sweet ballads. There are wry stream-of-consciousness treats and heartfelt proclamations about loving his wife and kids.

I managed to grab this record as a free download, but a few weeks later bought the CD too. I wanted more latitude in where I could enjoy it and I wanted to ""vote with my wallet"" and support a worthy artist.

I don't suppose Shinyribs will ever catch on with the masses. It seems to me that the best music -- like the best literature -- never makes it to the limelight. But I guess that's why I'll be able to see Kevin Russell and company two or three times in two or three days at the Sisters Folk Festival and sit just a few feet away. Can't wait."
"Gulf Coast Museum by Shinyribs <SEP> Great album - style and songs are a little different than what is currently accepted as popular music. Especially like the song on track 8 ""Song Of Lime Juice & Despair"" seems to me it should be a hit with a very catchy tune that sticks in your mind."
"Deeply moving, glorious warm sound. <SEP> Outstanding playing, both from soloist Harry Shulman (one of the great oboists of his time, which included Harold Gomberg in the New York Philharmonic, Ralph Gomberg in the Boston Symphony, etc.) and from the accompanying orchestra under the direction of Daniel Saidenberg.
I own one of these recordings and recently gave another copy to my niece, who remembers being deeply moved by it when she was growing up; her mother owned the recording and used to play it.  A very precious example of the kind of playing that was available around New York during the 1950's and '60's."
"Another song from Tonight Alive in await of their new album <SEP> I love the energy of this song. I also love the fact that they brought Benji Madden in this song. Benji Madden is from Good Charlotte with his brother Joel Madden. Benji Madden can also be found on Mest's album where he is featured in for ""Jaded (These Years)"", MxPx where he takes part in two songs, ""It's Alright"" and ""On the Outs"", Goldfinger where he is in ""January"", Hazen Street where he takes part in ""Are You Ready"" and ""All That"", and he even takes part in one of the only LostProphets songs that I like ""Last Train Home"", and he actually is EVEN IN the horrible rap group Three 6 Mafia, being featured in the song ""My Own Way"". If you like this song, also consider checking out their best song by far ""The Ocean"", and make sure you pick up their new record.

Rating- 5/5"
"A really fun album that I've enjoyed for years <SEP> A really fun album that I've enjoyed for years.  Great musicians, great riffs and melodies.  This disc has a wide variety of jazzy, funky, danceable grooves from a crew that is clearly having a blast and wants you to come along for the ride."
"song is great, but amazon digi quality is terrible <SEP> song is great, but amazon digi quality is terrible, the track cuts out with about 10 seconds left in the song. please give me my money back"
love it <SEP> Origional songs from the recording studios always sound better then they do from collections such as the 'this is what i call music'.  Sound is great!
"huh <SEP> Everyone went crazy over Rick Ross's lyrics. Yet they never pulled the song off air. No excuse me, they didn't edit it out completely or force him to write something else. Def. need to hear things before I waste money on them."
"Music is wonderful but the analog to digital transfer an abomination! <SEP> I own this album on vinyl.  Have waited for it to be available in digital form for a long time but unfortunately this remaster to digital is horrible.  There is distortion, many drop-outs, and instruments in the original mix are left out.  I don't know if the analog master was in bad shape or the problems occurred in the remastering.  I don't know if they went back to the original multi-track tape or used a two track master, but in any event, this entire album needs serious restoration and remastering before it should be released.  I wrote to Amazon and requested a refund.  I will use my vinyl LP and do my own transfer to digital.  Thanks for listening. Gary"
Amici Cantanti <SEP> This is the most awesome CD! It has to be heard not listened..wonderful blend of voices and the piano sounds like a virtual orchestra. Love the combination of songs chosen..takes me back to my parents era when music was music to your ears!!
"Lost treasure - needs a polish <SEP> Great little album, this - issued in 1981 on the tail of its minor radio hit 'Just So Lonely' and not seen since: it never got a CD release.

Now that it's surfaced again I thought I might cop a nice clean set of tracks - my vinyl's all worn - but RKO Music hasn't bothered. Sound quality on these MP3s is poor, very lo-res, a real disappointment and a rank disservice to a fabulous flash in the pan. Do it again right, RKO - and I'll buy it again; but I can't recommend this issue.

Get Wet is great - eight original songs by Zecca (the band's pianist) and one cover, Where the Boys Are (out of 1960, by Connie Francis). Sherri Beachfront's magnificent on lead vocals - arrangements are smart and tough: boppers, ballads and rockers all shine. Phil Ramone can take a bow as producer.. but the band's live set at the Ritz in 1980 (now on youtube) shows that they had these songs ready to record. Guitar player Louis Lepore deserves a mention, too.

Four stars for the band and the material - but until RKO issues something serious, the consumer would be better served with fresh vinyl."
j. brown CD <SEP> the sound quality on this recording sounds very - inappropriate in comparision to other james brown recordings I have in my possession
"Music Collection #2 <SEP> Well done - beautiful music - well produced.  I have now received exposure to a variety of great music - I never would have owned seperately.  Thanks to the ""various artists"" that took the time to enrich my life & Amazon for making it available."
sing this outloud <SEP> I think I like the glee cover of the song more than I like the actual artist for the song! Go Glee!
Five Stars <SEP> Love them & will miss them!! :-(
Just okay <SEP> Its okay but as a music enthusiast im not all satisfied. I think its overpriced. Less music selection. Its a good temporary music to have.
Five Stars <SEP> Golo is a soca classic hit. A must have if you are into soca music!
"boring. <SEP> The novelty wore off after a few listens.., boring."
"Weird, but just in time for Halloween... <SEP> Ok, the 30 minute song is kind of ridiculous... It's just light sounding-almost scary music and noises with a voice talking at the very end.  All the songs are really weird, like for some bad horror video game (with some adding talking-voice effects.)  Has a very Halloween vibe."
"but these are poorly done - using poor equipment by the sound of them <SEP> Five stars for the music. Zero for the actual product. These mp3's are vinyl rips. I didn't see that in the description, but I suppose I could have missed it.

I'd be okay with vinyl rips, but these are poorly done - using poor equipment by the sound of them. Lots of sibilance. Lots of surface noise, pops/clicks and inner groove distortion. Like they were done on one of those cheap Crosley setups.

That said, this was great music. My dad picked up the cassette on a whim from a $.25 bin, back in the early 80's. We played it to death. I found an unplayed, white label promo LP at a used record shop.

These will sound okay for most folks. Just know what they are."
"Beautiful <SEP> Lovely and classic Vietnamese melody and thoughts.  But this plays to everyone, even the French pieces.  Not just some ethnic sidebar."
Perfect for everyone <SEP> This the song that started it all for me. A strong Christian message that crosses denominational lines. Perfect for everyone!
"Thanking GOD <SEP> Just wanted to thank GOD for allowing me to live-out my dreams, & advise everyone to buy this album. I Love IT!!!"
"I would like to know exactly where these song versions come from <SEP> I would like to know exactly where these song versions come from. I heard ""Tomorrow Belongs To Me"" played at the end of Season 2, Episode 10 of THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE, and followed the link here to get more information, but there is no more information. There and here, it says ""Broadway cast,"" but this sounds like none of the Broadway cast recordings, and is riddled with synthetic orchestral sounds. Does anyone know where this recording comes from, and who are the artists on it?"
"great song <SEP> very rocker song lke theat they stick to their roots and not experiment so much with other music
Anyway this is a great buy the entire album is good I have already downloaded it as well............"
Hilarious!  And mostly clean <SEP> No bad words but one adult reference to sex.  One of their best since Einstein vs Stephen Hawking.  Buy it!
upbeat love it <SEP> great song
Five Stars <SEP> I love this music. I recommed to purchase.
"Have to hear it! <SEP> Best rendition of the song I've ever heard.  I've liked this version of the song since 1969, when I first heard it.  I had it on an album (33 1/3) and on cassette, both of which eventually got destroyed, so now I ordered it here."
I like <SEP> it's an original snoop dogg song just the hillbilly buckwild version. I like it
"Okay, but doesn't compare to Sounds of Blackness Version <SEP> Ordered this by mistake because I had forgotten the name of the artists who sang the version I liked.  This is okay, but does not hold a candle to the version performed by The Sounds of Blackness.  Now that I have their version, will probably never listen to this one again."
Five Stars <SEP> This is such a great song and Opera. I love David Porter's production.
Five Stars <SEP> liked it
Five Stars <SEP> This worship song is my favorite!
A Must Have <SEP> Very Anointed Song. His Word does Not Reurn Void and this song proves it! Be prepared to be Blessed!! Buy it now!
Five Stars <SEP> Real life
Loved It <SEP> My song downloaded quickly and with no hassle. It is a great song about being apart from the Lord and knowing that you need to be back with Him again.
"The preview only covers ""Arrival of the Birds"", the ... <SEP> The preview only covers ""Arrival of the Birds"", the first 2:30. The last 5 minutes of the download,  Exodus,  is a completely different song.  This is NOT the same song that follows ""Arrival of the Birds"" in the movie ""The Theory of Everything"".  In that version, ""Arrival of Birds"" is followed by ""Transformations"", which is essentially the same song."
Beauty! <SEP> This piece is absolutely gorgeous.  I heard it as background for a YouTube video and knew I had to have it.
Five Stars <SEP> Love major lazer! have always been a fan
Two Stars <SEP> Interesting music
"Five Stars <SEP> Excellent, both mellow and rockin'"
Five Stars <SEP> This song was a big part of my new realization
"haunting sound type song <SEP> heard it in the movie , Place Beyond the Pines, and just had to have it. Oldie type, with a hauting, unusual sound."
NOT the original artists. <SEP> These are NOT the original artists.
great set <SEP> I liked it big fan of this type of music they are very good recording for live songs . worth the price
LOVE <SEP> This song is BEAUTIFUL
"Fantastic job <SEP> Ii really like the way how this audio has been done. It's so well done. The music, the message, the order of the meditations, her voice. I just could say one word: impeccable"
"STOLEN AND A RIP OFF <SEP> This Song is stolen. She's known to scam. it's obviously the same exact track by Iconia Pop, if you won't believe me, then download soundhound or any music recognizing app and you'll see what I mean."
"Rocking good time <SEP> This girl group feels the music, and they don't hold back. It has already been co-opted as a backer for an upcoming movie."
explicit <SEP> When I downloaded this to my kindle for my 7 year old goddaughter it didn't say it was the full explicit version with &h%7 and Bi%*h in it. At least I didn't pay 1.30 for it.
"Great Album <SEP> This is one of the greatest albums for the Egyptian ""Better Life"" praise team.

Thank you for brining it to the Egyptian community in the US.

Whales Weep Not! <SEP> The beginning is terrific; the reader is great; but the allotted time of 2 minutes 41 seconds is not reached.  The poem abruptly ends after 30 seconds of reading it.
Five Stars <SEP> Love dis song
"they are exceptionally good singers very creative <SEP> i think the staves are not very well known in this country, but in my opinion, they will leave their mark on music history in the likes of CSN. they are exceptionally good singers very creative. you'll see."
"REAL Hip Hop <SEP> Anyone who likes REAL hip hop with a true story should have this. Great talent, great beats, great music!!! Get this!"
"Tony's talent and style take center stage <SEP> I love Tony's video reviews of guitars on The Acoustic Letter on YouTube, so had to try one of his albums.  So far, it's great - I love his playing style.  I'm not crazy about bluegrass, which much of this is, but it's still wonderful, relaxing and involving music.  Highly recommended!"
"Baby It's Me is an awesome album!!! <SEP> I like this upbeat tempo. It is fun, danceable and one of Ms. Ross' better albums. It has a nice mix of songs on it, beautiful ballads like Too Shy to Say and Confide in me. I love Bill Withers songs and Diana does a fantastic rendition of The Same Love That Made Me Laugh. I could listen this album all day and I have. It is a must have for any Diana Ross fan."
"On Repeat! <SEP> I absolutely love this! La voce della luna was one of the first songs I heard by Matteo, that voice...utterly amazing! This is a wonderful song and he sings it beautifully."
Great song and high quality mp3 <SEP> I LOVE this song!!!
One Star <SEP> wrong version
I like the original version <SEP> This version is not like the original. I like the origina arrangement much better. This was not what i expected...i heard the original and thats what i thpught i was ordering.
Four Stars <SEP> having fun with the dance
good bar band <SEP> The members of this band work hard.  It's mostly a family band with the guitarist being a family friend.  I've seen them perform multiple times.  They play and sing very well.
"Great Song - Good Sound <SEP> This brings back memories from the fall of 1965. Of all the hits this 'British Invasion' band scored, this one was my favorite. I always liked their uncanny and direct approach to this style of music. Somehow, their material packed a lot of punch. Eric Burdon's powerful and heartfelt vocals contributed a lot to this. The MP3 sound is quite acceptable."
The Grass is Blue! <SEP> Great Bluegrass just what I've come to expect from ricky skaggs and ky thunder
Five Stars <SEP> awesome

"Start Dreaming <SEP> Listened to it as a promo gift when it was first released.  Interviewed Neo on my radio talk show, ""DrV Presents"" in 2013, now I must have my own personal copy because this release is timeless. He certainly intensified my dreams. Getting ready to do an East Coast Tour with Neo in 2017 - InMyKey with DrV featuring Neo Blaqness, themed ""Love Is....""

Generic and uninspiring <SEP> Generic walk down the steps - see your guide/sanctuary/whatever formula.  I found the music for the first meditation rather full of distracting beeps.  You can find free meditations on YouTube which are much better than this album.
"Is it never really a man who can rule the world. It is the she wolves who rule the world. <SEP> There's always a song that you just never get tired of & this is one of them. If you haven't experienced an ultra music festival, you definitely should!"
"Epic song <SEP> Fantastic beat, heard it once on the Global DJ Broadcast and had to have it. great work this song, well worth buying!"
"Terrific fresh sound. <SEP> I saw Alexx in concert and she rocked and I talked to her in person. She is definitely in spirit of rocking! Anyway, I had been waiting patiently for her cd and now I got it, I love it from beginning to end. I definiely recommended it to anyone out who love a fresh rocking sound. Worth a listen!"
"Song Of Promise <SEP> I heard the song on XM Radio ""Enlighten"" and enjoyed it so much that I decided to order it on Amazon."
i thoght it was the whole album just threw it ... <SEP> i thoght  it was the whole album  just threw it in a box in the closet
Not the original <SEP> I bought this for 99 cents thinking it was the original 1969/70 version when Rare Earth first came out. This is Rare Earth geezer version; a remake. It's ok just not the original. Look for a different greatest hits or the original album if you want to relive your high school memory like me.
"A synthesizer-ed version not near as good as the original song <SEP> I always preview songs before I buy and download. I couldn't hear it on my computer's small speakers, but this isn't the original version. It's Rare Earth for sure, but I don't hear any drums and I do hear synthesizers. Not happy with it."
"Boring <SEP> same song, different versions."
"Not my thing <SEP> I didn't quite enjoy it. It was free, but the style was too vague and all over to be enjoyed."
"I guess I'm too old fir this <SEP> I really don't remember Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings.  Usually I ""buy"" free music and then listen to
it.  I must have not liked it because it is deleted."
Love this song! <SEP> Great song; gives off something of a Coldplay vibe.  Highly recommend.
"A mix of different types of music. <SEP> It remind me of pop, meets, rock, meets new age, meets all in it's own. A nice song for the buck"
"EDITORIAL REVIEW - Clara Sverner gives us a very personal view of Debussy and Ravel. <SEP> Recorded by English producer Jeffrey Ginn in Potton Hall, Suffolk, England, the sound treatment is extraordinary, making this album an indispensable item for lovers of good music.

Fun musical! <SEP> I loved the movie. I hope it releases in the U.S.
One Star <SEP> Can't review something I didn't received. It didn't downloaded. I was charge for it tough.
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent voice..a real singer
"Well nice going people <SEP> Not the Judas Priest Song!  Deceptive Advertise much? The cover is a knock off of the real thing,

Well nice going people.. ya got my dollar, You are all a bunch of heroes."
excellent country music <SEP> country music at its best
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song.  Can't understand why it isn't getting more airplay.
"if this aint country.... <SEP> For starters the other review has missed the point entirely, and anyway to be compared to the legend that is Hank 3, to me, is a huge positive..... This band aren't trying to copy, cover or emulate other artists. They merely have a talent of listening to who i assume must be artists like bob wayne (who makes a guest appearence), Hank, Hank jr and Hank 3, david allan coe, and johnny cash, and put their own spin on it. And those of you wanting a garth brookes, line dancing, stetson wearing sing along, forget it. This album is rough, raw and made with a punk attitude and snarl. Lyrics involving murder, drug reliant truck drivers, and 'getting coffins ready', set a gloomy scene of the american deep south (or the fens!!). With the well written songs, and a heavy english folk influence thanks to fiddle player and vocalist georgia shackleton, the album will also appeal to those that aren't necessarily interested in 'outlaw' country. Just like bob wayne, this album may appeal to punk, metal and rock fans which is a huge credit to the quality of songwriting, and musicianship of the band. Purchase the album, you won't be disappointed."
"Hank 3 wannabe <SEP> These type of songs have been covered by Hank 3 already. The main vocal is to weak and is drowned out by the music, maybe that's the idea. The choice of songs is not going to go over well with women, especially ""  I'm gonna shoot that woman thru the head"".  I guess they're going for the rowdy redneck crowd. I liked Hank 3 when he first came on the scene but he started putting out garbage like this trying to gross people out with the language. Just a waste of time to me."
Four Stars <SEP> PLAN TO DOWNLOAD MORE
"Love, love, love this debut solo album from Rich Collins! <SEP> My husband and I really enjoy this album. We quickly found ourselves singing along in the car the first time we listened to it. It reminds us a bit of Rascal Flats or Tom Petty - good music with catchy lyrics. It is really impressive for the first solo album from Rich Collins. Well done! I think Rain and Zombie Radio are our favorites but the entire collection is enjoyable. Frankly, the CD is great but I think it would sound even better live. Don't hesitate, just buy it. You will enjoy every song!"
Five Stars <SEP> This album is perfect from start to finish. The title track is absolutely beautiful
"This is a must buy for ANY music fan. <SEP> This album is incredible, and absolutely beautiful. It is just a brilliant piece of art, slightly ambient, yet slightly complex. Must buy."
Five Stars <SEP> The arrangement was superb. Ms. Salvant 's version of this standard is right on.
"Annoying Re-Hash <SEP> This album is nothing short of a rip off.

I have every one of this bands albums including this one (unfortunately).  And to sum it up this is an album from a band who is a sinking ship, and this album is simply an attempt to bail out water.

1st off it's mostly re-makes of songs they've already put out (none of which are better than the originals).

2nd, the couple originals on it or terrible and not a shred of what made this band great.

3rd, The entire album sounds like it was digitally produced! It doesn't sound like a single instrument was actually played for this album (outside the guitar).  Even the vocals are completly digitized.

To sum it up, this album could be 1 of 2 things.....A stop gap before releasing an album they're really working hard on, or this CD could be their last."
Great <SEP> Nice old school jazz sound.  Remind you of sounds from the Cotton Club in Harlem.  Cecile has great depth and vocal range.
"Beautiful Cover <SEP> The first thing you notice about this cover is that its tempo seems just a little slow.  At first it seems the song is going to drag, but then the music starts and that incredible double harmony of the main theme comes in and you hear that this clearly will not be the case.  The slight drop in tempo is going to allow you to enjoy more of this song.

The first solo is an extended trumpet slow, clear and steady, distinct in phrasing, not pushy or thin.

Next comes a subtle guitar solo, with respectful tone.  No histrionics, nothing volcanic or screechy, but smooth.

The sax follows with a measure and again highly respectful solo.  No rabbit-fast riffs of scale-shattering runs, just smooth notes exploring the song and its changes.

And bam, it's over.  You get the solos, then the chorus once through and that's the five-odd minutes of the song.

Bottom line: if you're a fan of this song, this is an excellent addition to your collection of its covers.  It is thoroughly faithful to the original."
"Dancy <SEP> Beautiful song.. Cannot stop dancing....  To be honest, all the songs a great and carry an exquisit jazz touch. These musicians stand out among all others. That can of music is not easy to produce."
Awesome! <SEP> I love this song... You don't just have to be a Knicks fan to get down with this.  Grooovy tune!
"Whoa...Sounds fusing together!...Like flavors in a good curry <SEP> There is a unique sound to this album, with great lead and backup singing. The overall sound is hard to pin, yet you'll hear echoes of the James Gang, Nirvana, Marshall Tucker, Hendrix, Allman Brothers, U2. How's that for a mix? And showing my age? Throw in doses of xylophone, banjo, lap steel guitar, ukelele, organ, strings. The music is all over the map, yet, it all still melds into a sound that will someday be called ""Wheeler Brothers"", imo. A fantastic album. Best I've heard this year."
Five Stars <SEP> Just another wonderful example of Erik Wollo fine composition!
"Wollo does it again <SEP> I use Erik Wollo in my ceramic studio: Some for throwing, some for decorating. Airborne is for decorating. It's fresh, flowing, and helps the brush do the work!."
"Yup it's a 5 Star Review <SEP> This is the first one by this Artist I have bought, I will be checking out more!!! The blending of what I call space music with some tribal beats/instruments creates a wonderous atmosphere. I will also be checking out ones he has done with Steve Roach who is one of my favorite Space music artist. Thats all for now Space Cadets, keep your eyes to the sky."
"Brought more blues <SEP> Bought this by accident. Returned it after one listen. Find Holley's. It's out there on reissue [or boot]. It's the flip of Words of Love for those who don't know.
Much like if Pat Boone would have recorded. No, actually worse."
great music <SEP> great music that  with the movie provided lyrics that inspire and encourage a person to take their first step on their road to recovery
"Lady Harlem <SEP> Very good, but long house/dance song, with awesome narrative instead of singing, that actually doesn't make it seem long at all if you actually listen."
"Refreshing, daring and amazing... <SEP> Although I don't think it was the intention to write 5 songs that would be perfect for any movie soundtrack or mix for a road trip, thats just part of what Colin has achieved here.  I can't remember the last time I heard more than two songs off of any one album that were destined to become classics let alone 5 of them.  ""Walking To A Star' is one of the most original songs I've heard in the last few years.  A crowning achievement that has me looking forward to the other two volumes of the 'It Only Took A War' series."
Five Stars <SEP> Great article from a unique Russian indie rock band
So glad to find it <SEP> this was the only song my dad requested for his memorial. So glad to find it.
"Low quality mp3 on a spectro. <SEP> I wouldn't shell out the big bucks this cd is getting, it's an mp3 cd & not even a good 320, about 192 is what it specs at, not cd quality. You'd get just as good a copy buying the mp3 & alot cheaper."
Very moving ! <SEP> I love  this  cd . It gets you feeling like you are you. They  rock .We  should here this more in the usa.
"Sad but true... <SEP> Except for ""Cold"" the rest of this album blows. These kids need to reconcile and get back to what made this band great or just f'ing retire."
"the greatest version of Dylan's song put out to date <SEP> In my, and my brother's opinion, the greatest version of Dylan's song put out to date. We have hunted for it for years. We had it on cassette in the 80's and it gave out over a decade ago. It was great to hear it again and so clean compared to the old cassette. In both of our opinions it has stood the test of time. Still a super version of the song. The best yet."
"Not Worth It <SEP> Limited edition because it was no good, oh excuse me, not to everyone's taste. Slow tempos, no melody to speak of, no catchy phrases in the solos. A real air ball. Amazon won't sell it themselves."
"Amazing Album <SEP> The music is excellent, the lead singer has a unique voice that rocks.  This album is great to listen to while exercising or when hanging with friends.  I really enjoy listening to this album."
"The Parting Glass <SEP> A moving song beautifully done. The Dubliners ARE Irish music: political, baudy, humorous, passionate, authentic, heartbreaking. This song will be with me for a very long time."
"Do not be fooled - buy the original version, not this...read on <SEP> This is a re-recording, done by Geoff Tate and a hired session musician (Martin Irigoyen) for inclusion on Geoff's Queensryche album (not to be confused with the real Queensryche made up of the original core band plus their new singer), Frequency Unknown. Their inclusion on that release was part of his record contract, to give Cleopatra/Deadline records four Queensryche songs to do as their wished with. This is why there is now the horrid MP3 EP release, Silent Lucidity - Greatest Hits, which involves none of the original band members and was done without their knowledge or input. It is a cash grab, much like this re-recording. Geoff's vocals are lazy, out of tune at times, not done to the level of vocal precision he has performed with in the past. The music was not performed by his Queensryche. It was not performed by the more famous guest musicians on Frequency Unknown, or the main session plays who at least had some notoriety with their respective bands they played in. I have no idea who Martin Irigoyen is, found him listed on Wikipedia, found some info, still have no idea who he is. I know he is a multi-instrumentalist, because he plans all the drums, guitars and bass on the four re-records. But playing the notes is not the same as performing the song, and what he is doing is playing the notes. As far as the drums, he is credited but the drums sound either like a programmed drum machine, or an electronic drum kit plugged directly into a ProTools rig. They are electronic drum sounds, and if you listen on headphones, you can hear that they are one of the two...listen to the crash cymbals that sound the same on every hit, and are hard panned left and right...if it was real cymbals, you would get bleed between the left and right, and not every hit would sound identical. The guitar work is karaoke quality at best. I heard this and the other re-records, and just got the feeling that the goal was to produce a backing track for Geoff as quickly and cheaply as possible. Geoff has to know that no one who knows this band will willingly purchase these re-records, when the originals are available for the same price. But he got a lot of money for them from the record label, as stated in interviews. If they sell, he gets money. If it drives people to purchase the original...he still gets money. It was all win for Geoff. Right now, Geoff has his version of Queensryche touring and playing, and there are some that will call them the real Queensryche, even though Geoff was fired from Queensryche and the real Queensryche never stopped being Queensryche at the time (it wasn't as if the band broke up, then two versions emerged...Geoff knowing the court said he could do this, went ahead out of spite to form his own version to compete, with the intention of trying to win the name and rights of the name in court). At least if that entity recorded this, you could possibly tie this re-record as a Queensryche release. But that was not the case. Because Geoff used some unknown session guy to do all the backing tracks, this in no way is Queensryche, anymore than any song off Kings and Thieves is Queensryche. It is Geoff solo, and frankly speaking, not very good Geoff solo. This gets 1 star for the deception in its creation, the fact that the session guy falls well short of a performance even remotely close to the original, terrible production, drum machine drums, and a vocal performance that was about as lifeless as you can get."
Two Stars <SEP> just a lame album
One Star <SEP> I want CD of this.

"One of the greats. <SEP> Mario Lanza had it all... the clarity, the volume and the perfect execution... of timeless classical and modern.  I like this particular section because it provides us a glimpse of both... and demonstrates why he was in his own league.  With respect to P. Domingo and others... the purity of his voice and ability to leap into notes at will really is why there are some folks like him that just stand a head above the others.  I enjoy this particular selection because it's not stuffy... despite the fact he sticks to the opera protocols and does not mix the glottal tones that I think even the great Luciano P. had to wrestle with in his search for precision and volume."
"THEY DID IT AGAIN <SEP> OMG!!! I love it. Long Life Depeche Mode I need you around here, God bless you all, thanks for all your songs.  M.L.G.... TQM!!!"
"Bad recording <SEP> Don't buy this recording as the downloadable version.  It has static throughout the movement that make it difficult to listen to.  At first I thought it was my ipod, but then realized it was the recording causing the static when I downloaded it to a CD and played it."
"Depeche mode!! <SEP> It's depeche mode! What else do you need to know? It it their sounds and words...they are the complete, enduring band we can't wait to see and hear!"
"If you want fun pop music, this is it! <SEP> Every one of these tracks is dance-worthy, and that's the way good pop music should be! ""Waiting for Love"" and ""Queen of Broken Hearts"" are a bit more mellow, but you can still move to them. Baker has a clean, clear voice that isn't weighted down with a bunch of theatrics like a lot of today's pop artists. It's like a breath of fresh air! And I don't usually like remixes (I find them boisterous and obnoxious), but the remix for the title track is pretty slammin'. This EP is definitely worth your time and money. Can't wait to hear more,  Baker!"
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful CD!
"A great tenor <SEP> From the days when male singers had to know how to hit a melody line and hold a note.  Yes, other tenors can hit the notes.  You don't cringe when Lanza does it.  Ear candy for people who love tenors."
"Too bad the recording has static in it <SEP> This is my favorite movement of the Scottish Fantasy.  So Scottish sounding, I could listen to it over and over again, except the download has a bunch of static in it.  At first I thought my car radio was bad, but then I listened to it on the ipod and realized it was the recording.  I wouldn't buy this version of it again."
"the best song <SEP> I love this song, the most romantic song ive heard, it tells you that virginity its not limk to the love i feel for you"
"The sound of classic progressive vocal house and the mixes are vibrant!!! <SEP> The mixes vary for the varying events and times for which they are suited, all work for me at anytime, but my favorites are the Matt Consola & LFB Swishcraft Anthem (great hi-energy which supplies plenty of dance floor workout buzz) and Manny Lehman's Club Mix (classic circuit vibe is ever-present and stays with you after the party has left you); I enjoy the other mixes, too, for right now these are on repeat-play for me.  Thank you!!!"
"Lacked punch <SEP> The song left a lot to be desired. It starts off okay, but the overall song is weak and doesn't deliver the punch."
"Great Album <SEP> I am not a fan of bluegrass music at all but I purchased the album because Matt is a childhood friend and I wanted to support him.  With that said, I have really enjoyed listening to the album and have enjoyed a growing appreciation for this genre of music."
"This CD was a joke. <SEP> There was only one great track on this album which was the first one called ""Tap Out"". The rest is garbage!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful in the office
Love their music <SEP> Love their music
One Star <SEP> Silly!
"Demon Dogs!! Ariel! Ookla! RIIIIDE!!! <SEP> Love this band, and this album is awesome. Geek Rock at its finest. ""Amora Adores Thor"" is a work of Art. These guys must have absorbed the OHOTMU through osmosis! I thought they knew their sh-- with ""Theme from Super Skrull"", but they've really outdone themselves. Best album I've listened to in a long time. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go check out Star Trek 3: The Search For Spocktopus!"
Disappointed <SEP> Sad. She still has not matured musically. Still waiting for a GOOD album.
Love it! <SEP> Waited a long time for this and it is unique. I can listen to it over and over without tiring of it.
Not Pam Thum <SEP> Very disappointing! Lacks the power of the original Pam Thum version!  If only Amazon had the Pam Thum recording for download!
Grrrr <SEP> I thought this was the one that Lil jon was on. So dissappointed
horrible knockoff <SEP> Horrible. I hate that these knockoffs come first in the list when you search. A total waste of my money.
Good! <SEP> I love the beat and the arrangement of the song. I will tell a friend about it at work and also my cousin.
"To quote George Carlin... <SEP> To quote the late, great George Carlin, ""White people should never play the blues, ever....never!"". Great production, but no conviction. Ya gotta make them feel like they're playing, not listening..."
One Star <SEP> Great
"""Transience of Love"" is my new number one album! <SEP> Walter Holland. Never heard of him before until I saw I had purchased the ""Transience of Love"" some time ago. I took a chance on him. Wow!

Holland's music is movie soundtrack quality and better. It is mostly instrumentals, and it is all ballad style, with long sweeping movements that take you on a singular journey. Simply incredible. His synthesizer work is better than anything I've ever heard in this genre.

I can only find two albums on Amazon, ""Transience of Love"" and ""Relativity"". In my opinion ""Transience"", the later work, is the best. I hope he has done more music since 1989."
"As Your Friend (Clean) <SEP> Great song, I love the music! The lyrics are okay, but the background music is awesome! Afrojack definitely could've pulled this off without words."
"Five Stars <SEP> I just love ""I've Fallen!"" Great Album!!! A must buy!!"
"Awesome <SEP> Check out The Joy Formidable if you've never heard them before.  If you see them live, you'll be in for a treat."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
"Another great album by Team Ghost <SEP> I really love this band and hope they tour the U.S. soon.  I do like their previous two albums more, but this is still a solid album."
"pure crunkness <SEP> Brillz is awesome, his trap is dope, puts on fire and when you think something is coming, dude hits you with something else. Enjoyed the CD."
"I Like It <SEP> I need the track to do a dance.  It is a snappy tune and it served its purpose.  Also, easy to download"
Great song <SEP> It is a very good song have not heard a song like this in a long time I really recommend you guys check it out.
"If you liked ""The commitments"" you will love this <SEP> One of the best ""soul"" soundtracks since the commitments"
One Star <SEP> Bought this by mistake. Thought I bought the real thing.
"metal guitar <SEP> I was looking for another songwriter, and bought this one by mistake. Metal guitar is not my style. Go listen on you tube before you buy."
Dynamic Music <SEP> I love this piece of music.  So energetic.  Beautifully sung and rendered.  It was the center of a birthday party I threw recently.
"I am not happy with this album. <SEP> Sorry, but I am not happy with this album.
It arrived perfect and just in time, but it is not an original album.
I can't remember if it is said somewhere in the decription, but I didn't see anything.
Also, for being a copy, it is expensive."
"Fakes Estatic Fear Covering.. No Booklet <SEP> Firstable, Estatic fear is the greatest band I have ever heard.
I am a collector, Therefore I collect CD's which has booklets that includes Pictures of the band and Lyrics
I bought the Two albums of Estatic fear (Somnium Obmutum and A Sombre Dance)on this website, Amazon.com
when I got the package I was surprised to see that it containes the CD and a booklet..but!
The booklet was two pages long.. inside the ""booklet"" was a blue photo of the sea.. NO LYRICS INSIDE, NO PHOTOS OF THE BAND
just a blue view of the sea (Which is DEFINETLY NOT what supose to be inside)
and the covering.. a disgrace.. just one picture of the real cover in small size.. surounded by black and blue frame (just like on the photo here on the website)
Like I said.. I'm a collector! I can hear music on the internet! I don't need a CD for this..
I need the real frames and coverings of the albums..
so if anyone is a collector and thought of buying here.. DON'T!"
Two Stars <SEP> Well... it doesn't have much substance.  I need to delete from my song library
Five Stars <SEP> Nice harmonies!
"This is a nice recording of the song <SEP> This is a nice recording of the song.  Everything is balanced, voices and instruments.  This is the quality I expected from the Travis Cottrell recording of this song but didn't get.  Much better version."
Song sounded good even though it has a country twinge <SEP> Nice clear voice on a good song
Excellent music from an excellent band. <SEP> Great CD as you've come to expect from a band as great as Eyeshine. Goes back to Red Stripes type of sound.
"SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE <SEP> TERRIFIC BLUEGRASS, LOVED EVERY CUT.
GREAT HARMONY AND MUSICIANSHIP.
DOWN HOME FLAVOR, BLUEGRASS AT
ITS BEST; A REAL WINNER ."
"The name says it all <SEP> What will come from a a capella group doing an album called ""Instrument"". No good enough stuff...

Since this is Neri per Caso's second album we may guess they thought: ""OK, our first album  was a hit, now let's move to be a normal pop group."" But the result  was a mediocre pop album. With the exception of two tracks,  ""Improvvisando"" and ""Perche' di Notte"" that are almost  a capella, the rest is plain italian-pop, so there is nothing special with  this album.

For the real Neri per Caso go with the first album (Le  Ragazze) and their fourth self-titled album."
"Don't Be Fooled By the Title <SEP> According to the Judy Room Website (a exceptionally reliable source), ""Most of the tracks are not from Judy singing in San Francisco. Most are from the 1967 ""Judy At The Palace"" album, a few are from Judy'a 1952 apaerance in San Francisico."""
Five Stars <SEP> it is perfect
Ouch ! <SEP> Piano is too loud with a boring pace that takes on a repetitious drone which heavily overlaps the violin. Ill probably be able to tolerate this CD when it is broken into parts with the I-pod shuffle edit but listening to the whole CD at once was a bit torturous.
Buyer beware. <SEP> Buyer beware. This is a bootleg. This is not an official Apple or Beatles release. Proceed with caution & be sure to research before you purchase.
Four Stars <SEP> A
Five Stars <SEP> Dancing all night long to this jam!!!
"Ripoff <SEP> I bought several $0.99 music collections the other night, but this is literally one song that is 4minutes and 22 seconds long.  The other purchases had from 100-200 songs per purchase!  Quite the ripoff ewhen compared to comparable selections."
Five Stars <SEP> I love the cd
"Great Worship CD <SEP> This is one of my favorite CD's of Steve Swanson. It you would like to hear more of his music, check out Friends of the Bridgegroom Worship Ministry at fobworshipmin.org  If you have never had the opportunity to hear him live and would like to check out his events page to see where you can hear him lead worship. Amazing worship!"
"Download not good quality <SEP> he sound quality is not very good, I expected a lot better quality than I got and it is so complicated downloading the song."
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent..love it..
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Phil Neal & The Wornalls - Lonely Tonight (Independent)
Over the last 30 years Phil Neal has fronted a number of bands, including The Artists, the Phil Neal Band, the Power Ties, and the Rockhills, playing hundreds of gigs, and honing his talents as a songwriter, singer, musician and performer. The Kansas City native is the epitome of a Midwestern rocker, and with his latest band, The Wornalls, he's in no mood to let his reputation slip. Their debut long-player ""Lonely Tonight"" is a genuine treat, the sort of record that The Jayhawks and Tom Petty brought out in their primes - records that combine rootsy Americana rock with hook-heavy power pop.

Back in the very early `80s, Neal and his band The Artists were regulars on MTV, and seemed on the verge of a major commercial breakthrough. It would be nice to think that ""Lonely Tonight"" could somehow replicate that success. Indeed, if it was just down to the quality of the song, and their execution, Neal and has band would be on near constant rotation on grown-up radio stations all over the western world. In reality, fans of Neal's brand of melodic rock and roots music will have to hunt it down, but it's time well spent. The album begins with a stone cold classic-to-be in ""Bad Boys"" - the sort of thing Phil Seymour or Marshall Crenshaw might have released back in the day. ""In Your Car Tonight"" slows things down somewhat, without sacrificing its pop nous, and the title track is surely a big hit in some parallel universe where good taste is still paramount."
"""Save Me"" is a direct rip from the audio track to ""Vicious Lips"" <SEP> As of 4/16/14 the song featured as an MP3 download entitled ""Save Me"" by Sue Saad and the Next is actually a movie clip from the film ""Vicious Lips"". This is not the song itself but rather an attempt on the part of someone to reconstruct the song from the scene in which the band plays at a club/bar. Essentially it is the direct audio track from the film with the videophone conversation literally chopped out. Amazon customer service has been advised of this issue / possible copyright violation."
Easy <SEP> I received my item smoothly very fast and with no problems at all. It was packaged well and one of my best transactions!
One Star <SEP> FUTURE WEARING A SKIRT AND NICKI TELLING YOU SHES WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS GO FIGURE.
"bait and switch <SEP> The album is not an original 45 it is a ""collectible"" copy.  The picture is not how it looked when it came. The cover and the label has the collectible company's name and art on it. It is not a Freda Payne 45"" it is a copy of her song. Very bummed because we are about to meet her and I would be embarrassed to have her sign a knock off."
Five Stars <SEP> Loved this track as a kid when I first saw this film in the 80s....
Five Stars <SEP> beautiful song!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Very funny!
"The divine is all there is <SEP> Dear friends, stop searching, listen to this master, surrender your body mind activity to the sacred spirit of Adi Da and you will self discover your own divine nature if you are really ready to embrace your true life."
fantastic work by great spirtual master <SEP> this is an excellent cd however not good if you are not familair with the work of adi da the great american guru-avatar. I suggest reading some of the basics first however this is great no matter what faith you are in becasue it teaches you that you must look always to your spirtual master for in him/her there is all you need.
"Gaps between tracks missing music! <SEP> Many of the MP3 tracks are clipped such that if you play two in succession, there is an audible gap with missing music. A mutilation of some gorgeous singing."
This is a very good CD <SEP> I listened to it over and over it is very nice music. it puts out the Word of God very well.
"Turn your Eyes Upon Jesus <SEP> a great interpretation of the song. I hope to hear more and more songs like this one, oldies made new."
just okay <SEP> I prefer a softer calming version as by David Archuleta
My son likes it! <SEP> Got this for my 10yr old son and he likes listening to it while playing Mine craft on his Xbox.
Loved it! <SEP> This was an amazing song.  It goes along great with the other songs Uriah has come out with so far.
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful....uplifting....nice update to a beautiful old hymn!
Four Stars <SEP> Love this Choir
"Yuk <SEP> Not my type of music .. not enough ""mo town"" in it. Purchased it as a gift but got to listen to it."
"WRONG song!!! <SEP> When I purchased this one, I failed to listen to the sample first.  Turns out the song I thought I purchased was not in this file - the one on this album is miss named and really something else that the Contours sang but not ""Do you love me (now that I can dance)"".

Amazon has since refunded.  Then I re-selected AND listened to the sample first!!  I now have the one I want and it's a good song!!"
Five Stars <SEP> love it
Five Stars <SEP> Play this one over and over!
"Goddess Music <SEP> Very lovely and real, makes me love the Goddess more. My wife loves their music also. Great music for Goddess lovers"
"A fantastic album with a lot of meaning behind it! <SEP> Every time I listen to this album, I'm even more impressed with it. Each song is different and unique in it's own way and you can tell they are meaningful.
My favourite songs on the album have to be Love Is The Greatest Thing and Turn The Soil; one having a brilliant rocky take on a sentimental subject and the other being just..beautiful.
Hux is such a talented musician and his music is individual, which I really like. I would recommend this album to anyone.. especially those who like songs that highlight the most important things in life :)"
I LOVE KING!!! <SEP> I LOVE KING!!!! I cannot wait until another ep is released I've been waiting patiently!! GREAT SONG AMAZING SO SOOTHING!!
"For True Music Lovers <SEP> King definitely is an up-and-coming artist with real musicality and vivid, abstract lyrics that can meet you where you are and take you on a journey! A great investment into my collection!"
"Groovy track! <SEP> It's King, what more can I say? This group is absolutely amazing, and this song ""In the Meantime"" is so groovy. I like the background arrangements. The song just puts me in a wonderful mood every time I listen to it. I simply close my eyes and think nothing but happy thoughts : ) When spending quality time with your significant other, this track will be perfect for such occasion. It is definitely a romantic song. The lyrics are clean and appropriate for its intended listeners."
"REALLY LOVE IT.... <SEP> THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC MY EARS CRAVE FOR PEOPLE.... GET WITH IT... MAINSTREAM MUSIC IS FOR DOGS & FOXES.
THIS MUSIC HERE IS FOR HEARTS & SOULS.....

DEAR KING,

AS LONG AS YOU ARE RELEASING TRACKS. I AM BUYING.

LOOK AT THE COVER AND ADD A 4TH HEAD IN THE COLOR ORANGE. THATS ME. I SWEAR IM THE 4TH MEMBER WHILE IM IN MY CAR AND SHOWER.

YEAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!

BOSS UP :)"
"Old friend replaced. <SEP> I owned a tape of this piece the year it was released. The principle composer is George Deuter aka Chaitanya Hari composer many of  the original Osho meditations, ie Osho Kundalini, Osho Dynamic and OSHO Gourishankar."
Five Stars <SEP> Nice clean playback version
"The Knickerbockers. <SEP> Great song, Reminds me of a past love. recommend anyone who was lied to in a relationship get this. Just somehow makes you feel better."
"Perfect soundtrack for a sad war movie <SEP> A somewhat better film than Restrepo but on the same general question: What the HELL are young men thinking?  Still, neither film adequatly answers the question, and neither provides even a glimpse of the bigger context.  This film was courageously filmed and beautifully edited.  It works in part due to the wonderful film score that drapes over the film a constant tension and sense of forboding that would otherwise be lacking because smells and vistas and complexity can never be fully captured in a film. Each cut compliments the emotions of the young men in the film."
"Great Band Era ... <SEP> An absolute treasure to be sure ... but first:

Thrift Store finds are often priceless, with this extraordinary boxed set probably given as a gift, and never played.  It's all on the 180 gram vinyl of the day, and according to the brochures included, the whole package could have been had in  RCA Deluxe Stereo for a mere three dollars more.  Each record has it's own high-quality paper sleeve, a sleeve designed to be anti-static, with complete record notes printed on each sleeve.  The 10 records are housed in a beautiful slipcase, the front half of the inner box [that's right, there's a box within a box] folds down for easy access, and the fold down area contains record and tracking notes.  The inner box slides easily into an outer shell to protect things even more ... and it was all a mere $17US when it came out as part of the Reader's Digest Musical Series, which when you think about it, was a lot of money back then.  The huge and extensive booklet is a hoot to read, slipping me back to 1965, filled with a virtual ""Who's Who"" of the record and audio industry touting the extraordinary sound quality of this recording ... and I must say, it is pretty amazing.

The music is laid out chronologically, and while most of the lesser known and brilliant bands of this ten year timeframe have been overlooked, there are some genuine surprises.  Even with the renowned artist gathered here, someone on the Reader's Digest staff took the time to search out and include some unexpected gems.

Yes ... you can probably find this material on compact disc, but I'm telling you true, if you've got to search it out anyway, grab the vinyl and treat yourself to hearing this music with the warmth and joy that only records can bring.

Review by Jenell Kesler"
Four Stars <SEP> I'm Rowdy Rowdy yeah!
great song to get you pumped up <SEP> I've never heard of this band until I stumbled across this song looking for music to get me pumped up for working out. It's perfect.
One Star <SEP> I thought this was the younger group!!
Didn't look legit. Odd printing and case. <SEP> Didn't look legit.  Odd printing and case.
Getting it on my iMac and into iTunes. <SEP> I just cannot get purchased music to download. Ive had this problem in the past. Im most likely done buying music from Amazon.
more opera! <SEP> same as i say about(opera) if you like by all means you will like.me i like the music not singing. that is why i listen to this kind of music.you like you enjoy. no whay to cut out singing (oh well)?
Most are not original recordings <SEP> Poor collections of remakes and most performances are not by the original artists.
Four Stars <SEP> What a surprise to find such good voices singing such worthwhile Russian opera essentials. Take a bow Amazon!!!
The old mono version is better <SEP> The mono version is better - less distortion and more like I remember it.
Four Stars <SEP> Okay.
just right <SEP> just what I needed to get into the Easter season
Expected a Church of Christ Choir <SEP> I expected a Church of Christ Choir singing acappella since that is a major tenet of their faith. Not gonna find it on this album.  Very disappointed.
"Disappointment <SEP> I was disappointed.  Since this album was done by the 'Church of Christ Gospel Choir', I assumed that the songs would be sung.  Disappointed to find that there were only 3 out of the whole album that were sung.  The rest were instrumental.  Could have ordered a different set of songs.  Wasted money."
"WARNING..... <SEP> Do not confuse this album with those by Artist:  Christian Gospel Choir....as did I.  Unless you like gospel music instrumentals done in the old ""Big Band"" style that calls for an image of a Vegas show........stay far...far away from this one!!! The few vocals are not worth the disquieting of the Spirit."
"Not royalty free it seems <SEP> Every time I use these in my videos, I get flagged on YouTube for copyright infringement. Apparently either someone else owns the rights, or someone else thinks they own the rights. Either way it's a hassle and I no can longer use these songs. Wasted my $ don't waste yours."
Royalty Free Music at its best <SEP> This collection is diverse and offers a wide variety of scores to enhance almost any video or presentation. The music creates a pleasant atmosphere for many different situations. This is a great value for such a reasonable price.
"funky rhythm & horns and great vocals, this music makes you feel good and ... <SEP> funky rhythm & horns and great vocals, this music makes you feel good and start to move. It is the most mood altering music around, a natural antidepressant!"
"The Big Easy in the Heart of San Francisco Honey Boys <SEP> I saw the CA Honeydrops for the first time when they opened for Bonnie Raitt at the Kennedy Center in spring of 2016.  I love the blues, Allen Toussaint, and now the California Honeydrops.  Someone said ""I love me some California Honeydrops,"" and I agree.  In an ever increasing synthetic pop world, here lies our salvation.  Mardi Gras in my living room, oh yeah!"
Four Stars <SEP> Nice background music for projects.
"Vinyl is in good shape, cover was a little beat up but ... <SEP> Vinyl is in good shape,cover was a little beat up but there was no poster, which is the only reason I bought it...not thrilled."
One Star <SEP> This song was added by accident and I don't know how to remove it from my play list!!!
"A little disappointed <SEP> I expected this music to keep me interested. It did not do that for me. I kept listening in the hopes that it would put me in a wonderful and happy mood, but it did not."
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song. So much.
Very enjoyable! <SEP> It is very relaxing!
"Every track is the same! <SEP> If you like the sound on the previews, just buy one track and play it on repeat. The whole album sounds the same. Might be good for a waiting room with a short wait time."
Five Stars <SEP> Dovetails perfectly with book.
Excellent <SEP> Easy to follow
The new narrator is terrible. He totally ruins the book <SEP> The copy I was sent was not by the original narrator.  The new narrator is terrible.  He totally ruins the book.
"Song is great, audio quality sucks <SEP> Song is great, audio quality sucks. What did you sell me Amazon? This sounds like a dub from a worn out cassette."
"Wanted this song and am disappointed in sound quality <SEP> As other reviewers of the You Make The Heat album/download have stated, this song's sound quality is terrible. It is monophonic, not even stereo and seems to be taken from very poor source material.

I would agree with doctorwholittle in that Amazon should rectify the situation and offer a free download of this song to those of us who wanted a high quality version of this song (and have paid for this atrocious version).  It is nice to finally have this album and the debut release on digital download, but this song's sound quality has scared me off of ordering any other song from these two releases (since both have received terrible reviews here based on their sound quality)."
"80's nu wave <SEP> Hate to be repeat myself, another in a long line of songs that my husband saw the video for before he heard the song on the radio. He says that ""The Producers"" had a couple of other songs,unfortunatly he can only remember bits of videos. Catchy tune it has a similar sound to ""Rick Springfield's"" early records."

"2 phun e is too funny. <SEP> Will be known as one of the most under appreciated artists ever!
People will be talking for decades about how no one has ever heard of 2 phun e.
His reputation for obscurity will rival John P. Watermouse. Another great artist everyone talks about, but has never heard of.

**And most of his other songs are better than this one! Especially ""Demon Lover"" and ""The Love in Your Dangling Eye""."
"great song. <SEP> Lovely voice, great song."
"LOVE IT! <SEP> What a great voice! Love this song, really hits home for me.  Hope she really takes off in the music industry."
"Buy this cd, just not from this web site! <SEP> Oh Im sure that I will ""love"" the cds that I ordered once or if I ever receive them. However, I really doubt that I will order anything from amazon.com ever again. I ordered this cd and one other 5 days ago and paid for two day shipping. That means at the very latest I should have gotten them on Monday. Im sure that I would have had monkeys had been running the show! Anyways, thank you amazon, thanks for pissing in my cheerios this morning."
Excellent! <SEP> Beautiful lyrics and one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. Mo's music has been a true blessing to me ever since I first heard him a few years ago.
Its getting louder! <SEP> This is a fun dane song for all ages!  My daughter (7) and I quite enjoy having this be in heavy rotation during our dance parties/house cleaning time.
"the 2 lps encompass rock/jazz/ballads/instrumental jams and santana like latin rhythms <SEP> this band and lp are on my top 10 list of all time!  they recorded 2 lps of which this is the second. artist roger dean(yes albums) did the cover.
the members are mostly unknown to general music fans. the 2 lps  encompass rock/jazz/ballads/instrumental jams and santana like latin rhythms.some songs have all these genres packed into 1 track.
the standout track for me is Watching the world pass by. 9:33 in length this track is the epitome of a rock jam. starting as a mid-tempo rocker it travels thru various musical surprises and climax's with one of my favorite guitar solos ever. guitarist derek foley puts in other good performances throughout both lps.
formed in 1970 paladin disbanded in 1972 when frustrated by lack of success in usa."
"Classic NKOTB <SEP> I heard them sing this song live during their ""Package Tour"" and I fell in love! you can feel the heartbreak and feeling in their performance...goosebumps!"
"Music on some tracks <SEP> If it has music, it ain't  A Cappella  .."
Five Stars <SEP> Inspiration
Played out. <SEP> The song is fine. I just can't stand it anymore. It was great for the first few weeks... I got over it quickly. I wish i could get my money back for this one.
"LOVE IT!!! <SEP> I have ordered the full CD, can't wait to hear it!!!!  Have always been a Robin Thicke fan for years!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Nice Tune
DATE RAPE SONG. <SEP> Song about date rape--thumbs down
Five Stars <SEP> never ordered
Great song <SEP> takes me back to college days and good times! It was a standard at our parties back in the late 80s
Hard to find 80's oldies <SEP> I have been looking for this album for years! So happy to hear these songs again
I love the song I just paid for it and could ... <SEP> I love the song I just paid for it and could not get it to download to any of my mediums . Would love to hear it but all ive done is bought it
"Warning- WORST transfer ever, the noise often overwhlems the music <SEP> This is a classic album, great synthpop from when the genre was still young. the song writing is top notch and the production really good.

BUT! The audio is horrible. IT sounds like it was transferred from a vinyl copy someone had thrown around the yard for awhile first. The hiss and distortion on the tracks makes it unlistenable in spots. I understand this was not a hit and the demand for it must be pretty low, but have some pride people. I would advise the casual listener from buying this item. If you have to have these tracks on MP# I would advise you just ripping a vinyl copy, it seems that is what Polydor did after all."
"Hollan Holmes enters now the pantheon with the giants of deep space voyaging!!! <SEP> In Euless, Texas, located deep space traveler Hollan Holmes returns with his 3rd album, as usual released on his own during March 2013 and again, just like with his previous ""The Farthest Fringes"" and ""A Distant Light"" albums, elegantly designed and packaged in glossy 6-panel disc eco wallet. Both above works were highly applauded and now ""Phase Shift"" is here to confirm huge composing potential of Hollan Holmes. The opening piece, ""A Precarious Trajectory"", immediately delves into graciously celestial zones, smoothly floating, expanding and during its second half bridging with sharper and elevating, sequencer-driven passages. A very strong intro!!! ""The Road To Perdition"" starts where its predecessor wrapped up, with briskly swirling sequencer mastery enriched by many dramatic cascades and eruptions. A quite hazardous journey perfectly exhibiting the theme behind this track. Warmly evocative, cinematic terrains are entered through ""Lost Memories"". This sublime sonic symphony is later joined by subtly pulsing sequences, yet still keeping its heartwarming aura. A truly gorgeous composition!!! ""Morphogenesis"" is the first longer piece here, clocking over 14 and half minute mark. Beautifully immense panoramas are masterly revealed with heavenly drones and angelic choir-like contemplations, here and there enhanced by various cybernetic hums and dissonant fragments. The piece gently drifts and builds until it reaches its peak when absolutely breathtaking sceneries can be explored. Get ready for total immersion, this is gracefully grandiose soundscape!!! The closing title long-form track, ""Phase Shift"" gets to nearly 33 minutes. Another big dose of sonic elixir for your body and mind is delivered here with tranquilly floating and ebbing infinite, rather flatlined drones. A masterful conclusion with monumentally expansive tension and ultra transporting effect!!! ""Phase Shift"" is a superb epic odyssey and another fantastic release by Hollan Holmes, both, visually and sonically. Without doubt, Hollan Holmes enters now the pantheon with the giants of deep space voyaging!!! ""Phase Shift"", which was mastered by his fellow Texas sonic sculptor Chad Kettering in his Soniclayers Mastering studio, is dedicated to Neil Armstrong. A must have for all connoisseurs of outer space oscillations and drifts!!!

"1 star for the quality <SEP> I was very excited to find this great record now available as a mp3 download.  Very very disappointed in the quality,  it was taken directly from a vinyl copy, snaps, pops and crackles included and even one really nice skip on  ""I play the fool""  which I guess is appropriate since I am the fool who bought.  I already transferred my vinyl copy to a cd,  snaps, pops, crackles but no skip on mine, was really hoping for better quality"
"So disappointed... <SEP> I bought this album back in the eighties when it came out and I still have it.  I've never seen in on CD, or in any other digital format so when I saw it was to be offered for sale on AMAZON.COM, I was one happy someone.  To my dismay, it's just a rip from a vinyl recording....pops, skips and all.  I just paid $6.00 for something I already had.  I wish there had been some type of warning beforehand.  If you don't have the LP in vinyl, it may be worth it to you but I feel totally ripped off."
Buy it <SEP> Pure Metal!
"A beautiful and haunting song. <SEP> I really love the song Soleil.  The music is stunning and Rin's vocals are just as good.  I would recommend looking up the music video on Youtube for full enjoyment as this song tells a story.  Also look up Len's cover while you're at it.

Note, like most Vocaloid songs, this one is in Japanese.  I would recommend looking up the English lyrics for the best possible enjoyment."
The best of the music of the past. <SEP> Wonderful performances evoking the great music of the 40's. A favorite of mine.
"THIS IS NOT THE RIVAL SONS EP LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWS MAY SUGGEST <SEP> WARNING: THIS IS NOT THE RIVAL SONS EP LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWS MAY SUGGEST. THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD HERE IS THE HOLLOW BONES BUNDLE (VYNIL/CD/T-SHIRT). I BOUGHT IT BELIEVING IT WAS THE EP FROM 2011. THERE IS NO DESCRIPTION AND THE IMAGE IS FROM THE HOLLOW BONES COVER, BUT THE SELLER HAS LABLED IT AS ""RIVAL SONS - RIVAL SONS"", SO I TRUSTED THE USER REVIEWS. IT'S A GREAT ALBUM, BUT NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE EXPECTING."
Opened for Black Sabbath <SEP> Great band cant wait to see them again.
Five Stars <SEP> Great album great band!!!!
"The 1980's group was wonderful. This group is horrible <SEP> BUYER BEWARE!  I don't know if this an issue with the seller or with Amazon but when you are searching for the first album by the 1980's power pop band Four Out of Five Doctors, it links through to this.  This not the same band.  The 1980's group was wonderful.  This group is horrible.  When I say I hate jazz music, this is the kind of tedious stuff I am thinking off.  You can find the first Four Out of Five Doctors album in digital downloads.  The first album by the 1980's group is well worth looking for.  The jazz album is really awful."
"great memories and a lasting sound <SEP> Old Times, great memories and a lasting sound!!!"
new led zep <SEP> Thease guys rock
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song!
"only one pirnciple, short. <SEP> only  4.27 minutes long, just one principle
read by Earl Nightingale  which is nice,  he delivers the  authors  thoughts well."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
Five Stars <SEP> way cool
"Saturn Return is Simply Stunning <SEP> I was a great fan of Zander's first album when it came out, Sonorous, and this album even surpassed my love for the first. I pre-ordered it and Zander himself signed the copy which was very awesome. He is still relatively small so he can do things like this and reply to messages as well. My favorite song by far on this album was Heartbeat Lyrics, it is beautifully composed and like all of Zander's songs features beautiful high notes mixed in with beautiful lows. There is no better music to relax and sit outside on a nice day or study for an upcoming test than Zander Zon's. A must have for any music lover who loves a calming and beautiful sound in their ears."
"I only liked one song <SEP> Only one song was played in the movie, the rest of the songs had nothing to do with the soundtrack"
"very bad quality cd <SEP> used, very bad quality cd...when i called to return it, i was told to donate it.  It appears to have been from goodwill to start with..."
"I just know that he's a really good Australian guitarist who does a bunch of collabs with ... <SEP> Haven't listened much to Plini. I just know that he's a really good Australian guitarist who does a bunch of collabs with other super-talented musicians like Widek, and Sithu Aye. Selenium Forest is my favorite track by him."
"Olafur Arnalds work is simply breathtaking in range and scope ... <SEP> Olafur Arnalds work is simply breathtaking in range and scope. Although I have not been to Iceland, I can certainly feel it in his music."
"weird <SEP> this song is weird, i'm not sure why i bought it, i only listen to it a few times because it's so out there"
"Annette Focks impresses again <SEP> Ostwind: Zusammen Sind Wir Frei is one of those films which, had it been made in America, would have been made by Disney. It tells the story of a rebellious teenager, Mika, who is sent to stay with her stern grandmother, a former champion show jumper, on the family countryside stud farm, in order to straighten her out. There she encounters Ostwind, a temperamental old horse whose lack of discipline and bad temper led to the end of Grandmothers competition career. Naturally, Mika and Ostwind bond, leading to reconciliations all round. The film is directed by Katja von Garnier, stars Hanna Binke, Marvin Linke, Cornelia Froboess and Tilo Prckner, and has a lovely original score by Annette Focks.

Like Night Train to Lisbon, Ostwind is fully orchestral too, although this score has a much more optimistic, upbeat sound, and even some hints of spaghetti western music in keeping with the films story about the bond between man and beast. The first cue, Opener, introduces the scores core idea, combining rolling percussion and subtle electric guitar accents with more classically orchestral string themes, representing the sound of urban Deutschland as it collides with the more stately pace of life in the tranquil countryside. This concept continues on through cues such as Mika Verwstet Ihr Zimmer, the more rock-inflected Treckerfahrt, the dreamy Erste Annherung, and the central motif for Mika, which combine electric guitars and hopeful, searching string writing and a lilting piano motif.

As the score progresses the more lushly, romantic, pastoral music becomes a little more prominent. The gorgeous Ostwind Flieht and the determined-sounding Reitunterricht have a real sense of openness and freedom. Sehnsucht unexpectedly introduces a faraway-sounding female vocal performance in to the palette, which is quite lovely. Einsam presents Mikas main theme in an attractive setting for a delicate piano. Conversely, Standritt brings the guitar and rock elements back in full force in a standout cue, and everything builds up to a powerful finale, which includes such excellent pieces as Grenzenlose Freiheit. With this score, and Night Train to Lisbon, Annette Focks may have finally started making a few in-roads into the consciousness of more mainstream film music fans  and not before time!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love this 45 by David Selby and Jonathan Frid!
"Awesome <SEP> As a single of his upcoming album, We Up is a completely new way that 50 Cent gets his message across. One of his best"
Five Stars <SEP> Love it
Four Stars <SEP> good song
Five Stars <SEP> Exelente cancion
"What a voice <SEP> This girl has one of the sweetest voices I have ever heard. She has so much heart in her music, you can feel her love for Jesus. I mean that's what singing Christian music is all about. I'm sure she will be around for years to come!"
I love it <SEP> Great song with a great message.
"No Track Stands Out... <SEP> Mostly mid tempo beats and honestly no track stands out.  I expected more after tracks like 2Step Bhangra, Turn the Music Up, Against All Odds, etc.  Disappointing to say the least."
"Trumpets of Glory <SEP> Several tracks incomplete. Performer marginally amateurish, at best. Save your money for something, anything, that might fun, interesting or informative. Otherwise, contribute it to a homeless person."
One Star <SEP> This cd is useless. Not in English
Five Stars <SEP> Love the music
When you buy a CD it comes with the words ... <SEP> When you buy a CD it comes with the words. This was just music. Wish it had the words with it.
Five Stars <SEP> What a beautiful song about trusting God!  Simple and honest.
"Huge 80s Euro Hit <SEP> Nostalgia hit in rediscovering this song.  It all but blipped in the States, but went smash hit in the UK."
"NOT happy. <SEP> I THOUGHT I was VERY careful to order the song WITH lyrics. I felt foolish wasting
$1.29 for a song I wanted to learn the words to. This isn't the first time this has happened either.
I will have someone watch my next order and see if it's me or a glitch in the order department."
One Star <SEP> 200g with the cover included maybe.  Record was from a public library collection and not a double lp
"Ugh.  Most of the background vocals are missing. <SEP> I love this Matt Maher song and I love to sing it, but I'm taking off three stars as most of the background vocals are missing on the background track.  The background track is the whole reason I purchase these ""studio"" performance tracks so I can sing along with the actual artist's music and background vocals.  Recording engineers, really how hard is it to simply cut out the lead vocal and leave all the background vocals ""as-is"" on the background track?  You guys are overthinking something here as I have had this problem before with other tracks from mastertrax."
Five Stars <SEP> Great Song!
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song
"Ordinary <SEP> I heard this man live and thought he was going to the reincarnation of Fritz Wunderlich. This recording is very disappointing - very ordinary, he has neither the flair the passion or the voice of Wunderlich"
"A real winner! <SEP> Absolutely delightful in every way. For this style of music, this is surely a must have."
Heart's Delight:The songs of Richard Tauber <SEP> ALL IVery romantic songs from Vienese operatas. As a bonus he is joined by Anna Netrepko. I highly reccomend it. Enjoy. BUY
"Gorgeous voice, beautiful sad boy. <SEP> I love that he sings so naturally without any real training.
I like how they mix metal and opera.
He's very inspiring."
"Awsome <SEP> Great song and even better singing....Nice smooth voice, will look forward to more songs by A. Corona, her country singing is even better....."
Cool Song <SEP> I love these guys. Cool song with memorable lyrics. An instant classic. There's a lot of great drinking songs out there & this adds a great drug song to the oeuvre.
Soothing <SEP> Perfect music for meditation and relaxation - I recommend this track for anyone who wants to get in the zone - especially beginners of meditation - enjoy!
very disappointed <SEP> It said it was from the movie sound track but although it is the correct song it is not the version in the movie. It doesn't even sound like the same person singing.
One Star <SEP> it was terrible! not what i was looking for.
"Rinky dinky the clown <SEP> This is my favorite song on the RMP CD--It's kooky, funny and has a great hook. I recommend it strongly to anyone looking for a song that will make you smile."
Five Stars <SEP> Good band.
"Mostly poor sound <SEP> This Russian bootleg uses what originally may have been good BBC radio recordings. However the Beeb didn't archive its tapes in 1970 so these are fan radio tapes, audio quality fair to poor. Several tracks heavily distorted despite fine performances. Not worth the high price."
"Should say ""with music"" <SEP> Not nature sounds. These are played sounds -- maybe a string bass or something else deep and resonant -- with other sounds over it. The other sounds are things like bird calls. I was hoping for the sound of a breeze in the trees or a breeze in the pines. That's not what this is."
Great Song <SEP> My little girls praise dance team has danced to this song a few times for black history month. Its a great song.
Kiss the brown ring <SEP> This music is too pathetic. The artist is an enrique inglesias wannabe who has no clue as to what good music should sound like.
Two Stars <SEP> not who i thought it was
Powerful! Awesome!  Great CD! <SEP> Great upbeat Worship experience!  Highly recommended!  No watering down of the Word here.  Its upbeat current music style while maintaining the core message of Jesus!
"Love this album. <SEP> Love Jaya the Cat, and this is probably their best album. Some really great tracks on here. Worth every penny!"
Five Stars <SEP> Great song. We need to be thankful for everything we receive from God. I love the group Mikeschair.
Great Song <SEP> Love the song. It reminds us that we should all have a grateful heart and attitude no matter what we are facing in life.
It is the truth. <SEP> This song tells it better and truthfully than any other song.  All we can do is say Thank You Lord for what He did and our salvation.
"It is not O Come, All Ye Faithful - It is Gloria in Excelsis <SEP> But it is good, Just not O Come, All Ye Faithful.  If it was labelled correctly, I would give it 5 stars"
Wont let you dowload to your phone <SEP> Dont buy this one it won't let you download. There's another version that let's you download it had to buy both
One Star <SEP> Only first like 15 seconds worth listening to
One Star <SEP> This is only a preview and not the full songs.  I should have read it more carefully.
I was completely disappointed. <SEP> If I would have known that this was just a very short clip of each song I wouldn't have purchased it. It really isn't worth paying any money for it. I was completely disappointed.
"Beautiful! <SEP> Absolutely beautiful.. I would say it was perfect, and it is compared to others, but I have heard Garrett play this piece as an adult and I hear more passion in the adult version.  That version is available on You-tube but apparently not recorded.  This one was recorded when he was 14 and had I never heard the newer one I would be totally satisfied.  I really wish he would record it again now that he has lived a little!"
Embarrassing if anyone catches you listening. <SEP> Honestly one of the absolute worst songs I have ever heard.
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
LOVE THIS SONG <SEP> I love this song its so good. Kendrick Lamar is very talented and I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE
"Jazz and percussion summit <SEP> Zenon brings forth his alto sax in a quartet heavy on percussion with Tony Escapa on drums,  Aldemar Valentin on electric bass;  and Reynaldo De Jesus on percussion. All selections emphasize african rhythms. Oye Como Va is very different from Tito Puente's or Santana's version. This tune brings in improvisations sometimes funky, other times purely african with superb conga solos. Definitely not a dancing sing along verison of Oye Como Va, stopping and then re-starting many times. El Necio slowly builds to a fast pace solo from Zenon, before slowing down and leading to bass solo, and closing with another Zenon solo that starts somewhat melodic but builds up to a faster pace higher energy solo. Double edge starts with a really fast exchange between Zenon and he percussion, which later slows down,  and then intensifies once again. Overall, the selections are rhythmically complex but interesting, requiring an open mind to new ideas, as the group explores the fusion of Zenon's avant garde solos and african rhythms. The sound quality in this live recording does not disappoint providing a warm and natural sound."
Great <SEP> When I was Younger I listened to a Station that Played Folk This Is one of the Best Songs From a Man With a Great Voice!
My wake up song. Its beautiful. <SEP> My wake up song. Its beautiful.
Sound file is damaged. <SEP> There are horrible breaks all throughout the mp3.  Sounds like it was ripped from a dirty old vinyl.  Please fix this...
One Star <SEP> not the original recording
Five Stars <SEP> Just a fun song from my childhood days.
Lovely but not the 100 syllable mantra of Vajrasattva <SEP> This happens to be the Gayatria mantra and it is lovely but it is not what I was hoping for. I think it is just mislabeled.
awesome song <SEP> this young lady has a beautiful voice! i wish her the best of luck! I am looking forward to hearing more
"Lovely Rendition <SEP> Though not as exquisite as other versions I've heard, this is a lovely rendition of one of my favorite Mendelssohn compositions.  A choir I sang with years ago performed this, and the director slowed the tempo.  This gave the song a much stronger tone.  I never understood why so many classical pieces are sung so quickly that the audience can barely make out the words!"
Dissapointed. <SEP> CD case was cracked. It's a gift for my mom. Disappointed.
"Overly Hyped Recordings of Hip Hash Trash <SEP> First, I'm what you call an eclectic music lover - I enjoy all types of music from today's hip hop/rap to classical music from the greatest composers of all time.  As such, I do have a few urban hip hop and rap albums in my collection.  And yes, I enjoy all of them.  When I heard all the hype about Kendrick Lamar's album, how he was the next ""Big"" thing to hit the market, I thought to myself, okay I'll give this artist a chance.

And that's just what I did. During my first listen through, (with headphones so I could hear his words, his nuances, and interpret his style of Rap), I was kind of shocked.  As I played each track, and they were just ""tracks"" for they couldn't be interpreted as anything close to hip hop, rap, or any sort of music, I kept thinking: this guy was supposed to be the next superstar?  (Perhaps Dr. Dre had been visiting one too many of California's Medicinal Herb joints of late?)

But I did want to give him chance - I always do to artists I may not understand or may not particularly enjoy.  Well, on my second run through, his voice began to grind on my brain.  His style, if anyone could believe it was a style, was so annoying, that near the 9th so called ""track"", I was praying for my player to accidently skip toward the last ""track"", just to end my misery sooner, much sooner.

Alas it did not, and I was subject to more ""tracks"" about himself, odd things, and dying of thirst, (hey Kendrick, I'm dying for some good rap, that this recording was supposed to have....but didn't).  And finally, my player was at the last track, a rehash remix of ""Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe"" (too late Kendric - you murdered my vibe early on in this recording).

Oh, I did give this album a few more chances - after waiting a week or two (so I could get my Vibe back), but you know, listening to his recording a few more times, well my Vibe was dead, dead and buried, rotting in some God-forsaken Coffin, in some west coast cult underground vault.

I know why his friends on the cover had their eyes censored out - none wanted to be associated with this mess of a recording.  Now, if only Amazon gave refunds for MP3 Albums that, in your opinion, sucked......"
This is a Clean Edited CD <SEP> This is a clean and edited version of Kendric Lamar's album. Just wanted to make sure eveyrone is aware before they make the purchase! You can't return MP3's.
stay away <SEP> Not original artists
One Star <SEP> Didn't read close enough. This is an album not a ball gag
"no way to down load <SEP> cant down load any thing from amizone to my personal player  ,or windows midia ,i have to stop ordering all music threw  amizon"
Envigorates my spirit to be the best me in my Saviour! <SEP> Contains Spiritual Food I could not live without. Gives me hope. Increases my Faith. Reminds me of who I am in Christ. Enriches my life.  Empowers me to live victoriously.
"Parents Beware! <SEP> This version is found under the category: Children's music. There is cursing in this ""kid's version"", the radio version is cleaner. There was no (EXPLICIT) label next to the title so I'm thinking it's a clean version for my kids."
"fake <SEP> Fake fake fake, not the real songs, do not buy"
She's Got the Heat <SEP> Great blue based song with masterful guitar work throughout.
Bad <SEP> NOT BY THE ORIGINAL ARTIST. Not a good cover even. It was just bad. Do not buy this version. Ever.
"Not the version I was looking for <SEP> I don't know who the wannabe is who is singing this song, but it in no way sounds like the version from the movie.  Very disappointing."
"Great CD <SEP> wasn't really familiar with Qwel but after giving the quick samples of the songs a listen, I figured it was worth buying and I wasn't disappointed.. glad to hear a cd with some production that has some originality and doesn't sound like the same thing everyone else is doing"
One Star <SEP> Dont like the remix
get rid of remixes <SEP> do not put remixes as the top song it should always be the original not to mention the remixes just butcher the lyrics of a song.
WRONG VERSION <SEP> wrong version
"Nice! <SEP> Easily my favorite song on the album. Not sure about my feelings for the album, but I love this cut"
"What is dis ? <SEP> YaH GOT TAH BE KIDDING MI MUN. Why is dis man embarrassing hym self. Mi tird grader can do better,But it is Snoopy dog right !!!!I give hym aye c fah his effort."
"this version has ""hooter town"" in the lyrics -- beware if that's not what you want <SEP> This *is* the exact same version that is in Prime Music (which I *already* have access to) -- with the ""hooter town"" lyric in it. But there was no way to tell that from the sample they provided. So frustrated. I like the radio version with Nelly but I find ""hooter town"" offensive. GRRRRRRR. And why oh why would Amazon sell the exact same version that's on Prime Music?!?!?!??! The cover images are different so I took a chance but was foiled. Very frustrating. I can find the version I want on YouTube no problem but want to listen to it on my Alexa, which I love. YOU SHOULD FIX THIS, AMAZON."
It was catchy but I'm not really into Creed or ... <SEP> It was catchy but I'm not really into Creed or Nickelback trying to be country. Yeah I said that!
"Includes Robert Lamm and Lee Lee Loughnane <SEP> This is a great tune, played by great players!
Trent Gardner is a great trombonist: the horn arrangements sound like they were done by Chicago's Jim Pankow."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!!!
When you hear this music....you know the Souls are coming... <SEP> This film is a personal guilty pleasure and getting these songs is a holy grail. Thanks Gerard!
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent performance and sound quality
Five Stars <SEP> 5 Stars for the album cover alone. And another 5 for the music!
"Rider <SEP> Great guitar riffs and sounds. These songs are tight, fun jam tunes! I hope for a full length cd of rock n' roll from these guys in the future."
"Great album <SEP> Catchy and provocative.  When I first listened to Music for Military Torture, I blasted it in my car for a week straight, and it's still in the rotation.  Great album... Highly recommended!"
Worse song ever <SEP> This may quite possibly be the worst song and worst voice ever written / recorded. Kris is absolutely talentless. There is no skill here. This is an insult to music and to humanity. Please take this garbage off of Amazon.
"Tyte Azz Trackz <SEP> If you like Shy 1,Twisted Insane, King JC, GraveYard Soldjas(1st album),get these tracks! This artist has a lot of tight a$$ tracks on The Birth of Tragedy album. This will be a classic album!!"
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
Not the original song <SEP> Not by the original artist
Two Stars <SEP> Not what I expected
Five Stars <SEP> Works for Me MORE PLEASE !
Free <SEP> this album is relaxing and encouraging. I received my KindleFire for my anniversary and was trying out the music fell in love with this artist.
Fun song <SEP> The song kinda has the 80s and 90s vibe. I love music I can dance to and this does it for me.
Two Stars <SEP> Ok
bad file <SEP> only got part of the song which seems to be what a lot of the files on here are like
"Carlos, stay in the flute, don't sing... <SEP> This is the second volume of the Mambo Dulcet Red Tailed Hawk. As in the previous album, Carlos decided to sing in this album. I don't know who told him he could sing. He is an amazing flutist but a mediocre singer. With so many good singers in New York, he could pay a couple of extra bucks and I bet the result would be much, much better. The selection of tunes in this album is excellent and the arrangements are beautiful. But when Carlos starts to sing, he kills the tunes. I have all his previous recordings: Arriving, Thoughts, El Flautista and Mambo Dulcet Red Tailed Hawk Vol 1 but until he does not stops singing, I think I will pass on this one and future ones. If it wouldn't have been for the singing, I would have given this album 5 stars."
Two Stars <SEP> OK - won't buy any more of this
Four Stars <SEP> I love this CD
Five Stars <SEP> Incomparable Sax smooth Jazz.
nice jazz songs <SEP> love the way she plays . very talented  jazz Artist will buy her music again  very very  nice  Cd  Good
"Return of the narative ballad <SEP> we lost Jim when he joined the MMR debate on the wrong side. It's good to know he still has some magic in his heart to give the world. Can't make up for all the children who will die of rubella, but still, it's a start. And it is a brilliant freaking song."
"Just not funny, where's Weird Al when you need him. <SEP> I don't really need to write much on this.  I am a Pro-gun Democrat yep they exist and I fail to see the humor in what is a serious issue for this country.  Jim Carrey must have lost his mind this time...cheers Jim, thanks for the laughs! Your career is done.."
"Horrible song! Dull and pointless <SEP> As a longtime Charlton Heston fan, I thought that this song was HORRIBLE. Saying rude things about an iconic legend will make people mad. I am also a supporter of the NRA. My grandfather is also a fan of Charlton Heston and the NRA and boy he HATED this when he saw this on the news. Jim Carrey should do more acting and less talking. >:-( >:-( Mr. Carrey doesn't know anything about guns or so called ""assault rifles"". Get some education! Jim Carrey lied about having guns. He has bodyguards to do the job. Gun control is just a dumb subject to talk about. Jim, please retire from acting and please retire from writing dumb songs like that!"
"Silly <SEP> It was kind of funny, but I disagree with the message so I can't give it a higher rating. Jim Carrey is free to hate guns but I will keep mine, thanks."
"Not his best <SEP> Tim Timebomb songs are hit or miss in my opinion.  When it hits, it hits big and it's all you want to hear for a while.  When it misses . . . you never wanna hear it again.  This one is more of the latter.  It's fun to have a punk rock take on this great song, but the nostalgia wears off quickly.  Soon all you're left with is a bit of regret and a song you skip a lot.  Listen on YouTube, get it out of your system, and save your money."
"Good 1990s Survey Album <SEP> A great 1990s mix ""tape."" I skipped a big chunk of the 1990s and was introduced to the music by a girlfriend. I found this CD and dug deeper. Mazzy Star and Yo La Tango -- wow!"
"The McCrary Sisters Seize Victory!!! <SEP> Digging deep in into their southern soul gospel roots the McCrary Sisters lay out thick velvety rhythms that just wrap the listener in the love of Jesus. I need to listen to this album more, but on the first go around I got the chills! Having seen these ladies live (what a blessing) I am impressed with how much of their voice intonations can be captured on an mp3.
Simply beautiful! Thank you for this album of love!"
"What A Surprise <SEP> I had NEVER heard of this guy until 3/29/13.  I was surfing the web and came across his name and album on a blog site that I visit.  Well, let me tell you, after downloading the album and playing it, I was taken aback.  He kind of reminds me of the artist Kem. He sings with passion and emotion on nearly all of the songs.  WOW what a breath of fresh air.  Nice melodies, pensive lyrics, and wonderful vocal arrangements.

A few of my favorites:
I Belong To You
Teach Me Tonight
Changing My Tone
Callin
Back 2 Smooth (Lounge Mix)

Most of the material on this CD is SMOOTH, he has a couple of up-tempo tracks, but he shines on the slower more intimate songs.

I was glad I stumbled across this artist.  Nice music."
Exquisite beyond words <SEP> This music is so hypnotic that it cradles the soul to dance with love and fly.  Love the instruments used in this song.  Wonderful assortment.
Beautiful <SEP> What can you say about perfection.
"Download Malfunction <SEP> >>I never received the Don Vappie recording of ""Do You Know What It Means to MIss New Orleans.""  The download did not work.

Ed Pramuk"
Cover Your Ears <SEP> A terrible embarrassment. Buble sings a duet with himself with disasterous result.
"Not the right version <SEP> I came this site because it was a link from youtube. I was watching the video to this song and the crawl advised that I could buy this song from amazon. Well I am glad I sampled the song before I bought it. This is not the same song that is used in the video. I have been having a hard time trying to find the remix that is used in the video. I do not kow if the remix has a different title, but it has the James Brown sample. I guess I will just have to watch the vid. if I want to hear the song.
Nice try Amazon, but that is not the song I want. The link below is the right version.
[...]."
One Star <SEP> This is not an Anglica Mara Disc. It is a Band named Cuisillos.
"Excellent <SEP> ""He Is Jehovah"" is a beautiful praise and I love the melody.  I highly recommend this music by Betty Jean."
"Therapy <SEP> I have found that this is the best version of this classic song and use it often by sending it to friends and family that are grieving.
Best way to offer sympathy is to send a flash drive or CD with just one song that tells it all.
Powerful and touching."
"You'll be waiting a long time for the night to close in! <SEP> God awful... granted I'm more of a fan of the No Mercy version, but even the Exile version is better than this. Trace sounds like the original song was slowed down using a windows sound editor.
He'll be kissing you all over for a long time with how slow the song is sung here! Pass!"
Love it? not so much <SEP> Love Traces music and I love this song but not so much together.  Just didn't work for me.. But Trace does.
"Love this song <SEP> and having Trace's wonderful bass voice added to this great song, makes it that much better. I listen to this song every single day and sometimes multiple times a day."
Love that I can buy almost any song instantly <SEP> Love that I can buy almost any song instantly!  This was for a class slideshow & I needed it right then.  Amazon always on and always has what we need when we need it!
Two Stars <SEP> song
Beautiful Song! <SEP> I loved the TV show and was divested when it was canceled.  The music was the best and I loved the song Reach For Me.  I have the CD which I also purchased from Amazon but I down loaded this song for my tablet and android.  The song is beautiful.
horrible <SEP> I have never been so unhappy with a music purchase. The tunes are almost unrecognizable and drowned out by the drumbeat. It is not like switched on Bach at all. I won't be buying any music that I don't know or can't preview.
I made a mistake thinking I was ordering a typical ... <SEP> I made a mistake thinking I was ordering a typical CD with a few songs. Instead it was ONE song which cost almost $10! Beware buyers.
"Absolutely an Awesome Album!!! <SEP> This is a great mix of music. Something for every mood. My favorite is ""The Salt"". Todd's lyrics are genius and his vocals are great!!! I love how he ties it all together with great bests and a tempo I can enjoy. I highly recommend this album to anyone who has a love and appreciation for great music!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> good
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
"smooth and soft <SEP> great dinner music, or making love music or releasing the stress music. Love it! I hope we get more young singers like Fawn."
"The whole package <SEP> There are very few albums that I listen to over and over and over again.  This is one of them.  A clean sound with enough diversity to keep anyone happy and a beautiful voice backed by catchy and very complimentary instrumentation, Bedroom Voice is simultaneously accessible to new jazz listeners and full of golden moments for more-refined jazz palates.  If you're looking for a ""go-to album"" for sitting back, listening to some great music, and relaxing with a glass of wine, this is the one."
"Great song <SEP> I am new to Band Perry, the video is great, the song. Is so much fun"
thank u <SEP> thank u. if you liked the movie then this will be a great for a ringtone and really spook people out!
disturbimg <SEP> This tune was haunting in the movie LORDS OF SALEM though its only 49 seconds it is enough! It is disturbing  and mesmerizing
"Not Clean <SEP> 1 is not for song itself but for the clean version which still contains the ""B"" word defeating my whole purpose for buying this version."
"but it doesn't sound it all like the song ""Put the Blame on Mame"" <SEP> This might be from the same movie, but it doesn't sound it all like the song ""Put the Blame on Mame""."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> Drastic Andrew - State Of Denial (Frogville Records)
Drastic Andrew are an interesting proposition, as they claim to mix ""oblique elements of Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, The Band, Talking Heads, the 90's, Cracker and Radiohead, Black Keys, as well as Bluegrass and classic country influences"". That's quite a combination of contrasting influences, but listening to ""State Of Denial"", the band's second album for Frogville, it kind of makes sense, insofar they're rootsy and country-ish, but with a distinct progressive, indie pop streak. I suppose, if a comparison is to be made, Wilco seem the obvious candidates, but there's something easier about Drastic Andrew, that's very likeable.

Led by singer-songwriter Andrew MacLauchlan, the Santa Fe based quintet nail their colours to the mast with a collection of songs that delve into various themes, from social injustice and the environment, to love and relationships. It's a range of subjects that songwriters are prone to explore, so it's to MacLauchlan's credit that he brings something new and original to the table. ""State Of Denial"" begins with ""Why Is the Sky"", which sounds like it might have its lyrical roots in the `60s Greenwich Village scene, but a full production and ambitious arrangement transcends its folk intimations. The horns on ""Wolfgang Fischer"" work brilliantly with Ben Wright's lead guitar and Kevin Zoernig jazzy keyboard runs, and the country styling of ""Just a Man"" brings instant contrast."
"... of recorded burps and farts - the cover is amazing. That seals the deal for me <SEP> I wouldn't care if this was an album of recorded burps and farts - the cover is amazing. That seals the deal for me. They should make posters of that image. There's no nudity, yet it's so visually jarring I nearly choked on what I was drinking the first time I saw it. Whoever conceived and took that photo has to be eliblgibe for some kind of award....anything. Never in my life have I looked at an album cover with more determination and said to myself ""I MUST hear what this sounds like...I simply must...""

Believe it or not, the music isn't bad either..."
L.A. Woman. <SEP> Are you seriously asking me this? The Doors are one of the greatest Rock groups ever. L.A. Woman is one of their greatest albums. If people under 50 (at this writing 2015) don't get it that's their loss.
no as advertised <SEP> perhaps include some kids actually whining instead of some nondescript background playground noise. what a waste of time and 99 cents .
"Short but enjoyable album for any listener <SEP> I was definitely impressed by this acoustic and brassy interpretation of some popular digital titles. Although the album was only four songs when I bought it, it feels more like an experimental venture from Madd Wikkid. I'd definitely consider their other offerings as well.

It's a fun, small, and novel collection of music to buy, and it definitely has some replay value."
"This is a wonderful song, a song from the past <SEP> I have been searching for this song for years and was too excited when I found it.  This is a wonderful song, a song from the past."
Music <SEP> It's a song!
"Love the mention of Texas in the lyrics <SEP> Great song, great beat"
Two Stars <SEP> Poor quality.
love 70's music <SEP> Bought back memories
This is not the song your looking for <SEP> This is very misleading. I was expecting the song by Train. I got an instrumental version instead and had to go back and find the correct version. I ended up paying twice for the song I wanted and I feel like I got coned in a shell game.
"This one song is true Bolero! <SEP> Definitely the song to play for someone's 50th anniversary party (for them to tango to); however, it's slightly dark. The imagery of the lyrics are reference to the duality of how you can't live without this person, and yet-together, you cause torment to each other from love's intensity!"
NOT THE CORRECT SONG <SEP> This song is NOT by Annie Lennox.  DON'T BUY THIS!
"NOT THE ORIGINAL SONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!! <SEP> This is NOT, I repeat, NOT the original mix that is soooo mesmerizing.

I want my money back! (Even if it was only $0.99, I feel robbed!)

I didn't even want to give it a 1-star rating.  I wanted to give it a Z-E-R-O."
It's a knock-off. A substitution. An imitation. <SEP> Turns out this is a knock off. I found the right song by the original artist and bought that too. It puts this one to shame. This version is fine as long as you don't compare it to the actual cut by the actual artist. Then it falls short on an order similar to comparing glass to diamond.
"Not as advertised. A cheap knock-off. Do not buy. <SEP> Just another waste of money, when its not what you want, Look closely, this was a rip off. not happy with this purchase."
Five Stars <SEP> Brilliant!
"One bad apple... <SEP> The mix is too ""direct in"" sounding, too crunchy, lacks warmth, and is over compressed.  These songs are no match for it's predecessor: Wing Beat Elastic.
The first Mike Keneally offering that didn't hit the bullseye did center!
Sadly I can only give it 2 stars because 3 stars would mean I think it's Okay.
Had I not heard anything before I don't think I would feel any different.
Mike Keneally is a musical genius!  He sings beautifully, has a great voice, plays guitar like a virtuoso, he's mastered the Piano, and  you wouldn't be far off saying he's god's gift to music.  From Zappa, to G3 this musician is one of the best on the planet.  His Sluggo Dlx CD/DVD is amazing, as is all his other music.  I am at a loss as to why the production is lackluster. One bad apple..."
"Not in 5.1 at All !!! <SEP> Advertised as Being in 5.1 in the Product Description, and as is the ONLY Reason I Bought This Copy as Having the Standard U.S. Version I Know Full Well What it Is Supposed to Sound Like & This is NOT it, NOR is it Even a Very Good Mix at All, as Certain Solo's & Guitar Parts Don't Even Come Through in the Mix, Very Very Disappointed to Say the Least."
"Bad pick <SEP> Sampler was offered by Amazon.  A quick listen at first was then downloaded.  After a more intensive review leads me to just say not for most.  Only 2 out of 14 track are worth the time to do any compiling for say a home made good for listening CD.  I'll keep looking for these samplers for, after all, there can be a sleeper artist or two."
NO WONDER I LISTEN TO THE OLD COUNTRY SONGS <SEP> Do people actually get paid for doing stuff like this. I wouldn't download this  if it was free. Anybody that buys this has more money than good taste in music or I should say garbeled sound this isn't music.
"Second Wind <SEP> I loved Second Wind, This rapper brings a positive message and I know that he will be successful in all that he do."
"Every song is HOT!! <SEP> Usually I only like a couple songs on any album, but I was able to let this one just play out! All of the songs were hot!!!"
Five Stars <SEP> the songs in the vol. 1 made me buy vol. 2
Five Stars <SEP> Great cd !! Duke did a good job putting some gems on the joint !!
"So disappointing... <SEP> I actually loved this album. The reason I rated it so low is that I recently listened to her second album and since that one isn't available on Amazon, I have to express my opinion here. I don't think I've ever seen an artist fall so far so fast. Clearly, she sold out and found a new producer that could offer her more money. The sound on her second album is entirely different: over-processed, almost entirely electronic, soulless, heartless...even her voice sounds different. Her willingness to sell out so quickly and needlessly renders her a non-entity in the artistic community as far as I'm concerned. She will never get another penny of my money. It's sad what this greedy, mindless society is doing to perfectly talented, capable artists and it's sad that so many of those capable artists are selling themselves short in the name of money and fame. I thought better of Tailor. I was wrong. Dark Horse is a great album...Tailor, unfortunately, is not a great artist."
"As of this date, this is a $22 record <SEP> Dont pay these vultures convoluted prices. Just because its old, just because its a renown song, just because both Freddie and Bowie are now dead  doesnt mean this is a $300 record.

Collectors  do your research. Dont be scammed by bottom-feeding opportunists."
"Rocking AWESOMELY <SEP> This is the only track I wanted after listening to the sample clips.  I normally delve right into a purchase for Paramore, but this time I just wasn't feeling the music, but track seven ""Part II"" was an instant love.  She's just reaching into my soul and rocking-it-out!"
Nope <SEP> Not still into this.
"I scream and run when it comes on. :-/ <SEP> Really cant believe this is Paramore. I wish I could give it half a star. This song is so completely annoying, especially when she goes off key and starts shouting. What a disappointment. They should make more songs like ""The Only Exception"""
Five Stars <SEP> Very good song
It ain't fun <SEP> It ain't fun.
"Emotionless noise pales in comparison to the original <SEP> I love Lzzy's voice, and if this cover was true to the Lita/Ozzy original, then I think it could have been amazing.  However, this is nothing like the original.  From the very first note, you can tell it's going to suck.  Removed is Lita's beautiful and emotional guitar work, and inserted in its place is distorted, muted noise.  All of the music throughout the song is heavily distorted, drowning any clarity of the vocals.  The original Lita/Ozzy song was beautiful and sad, and emotional enough to make you cry.  This version just makes me cringe.

I'm not opposed to distortion or this music style in general.  In fact, I actually like it.  However, it doesn't sound good on this song.  It removes all emotion from the song, and even Lzzy's voice can't bring it back.  Maybe I would feel differently if I never heard the original, but even standing on its own, this song falls flat because the distorted music drowns out any emotion in the vocals."
"Power-Pop At Its Best <SEP> This is a great power-pop song, along the lines of Belly/Tanya Donnelly, The Breeders, Garbage or Jimmy Eat World.  Even reminds me of the Breeders a little."
Five Stars <SEP> Great love this song
Good Song <SEP> I heard this song awhile ago at work and I instantly fell in love with it. I was happy to find that Amazon had this since I was having trouble finding it elsewhere.
"Hard to describe the impact of this song... <SEP> It's an amazing song--wonderfully constructed lyrics and musical movement. It's a really meaningful song to me, and it's extremely hard to pinpoint why. Anyway, DO NOT pay for this song. Pay for THE ENTIRE ALBUM."
Fantastic! <SEP> Fantastic! Why would I buy music I don't love?
Five Stars <SEP> Killer track by Device! It kicks ass!
"Some bands just really shouldn't cover NIN <SEP> I guess if you start an ""Industrial-Metal"" project, you are required to pay homage to NIN. I love NIN have been a fan for an extremely long time, and I am a fan of Disturbed, so seeing Wish as a cover on Draimen's ""Industrial-Metal"" project Device's debut album I really looked forward to hearing it. The beginning of the song is pretty much a note for note, sound file for sound file copy of the original. Then it sounds like someone learning to use fruity-loops got ahold of it and it all just goes downhill from there. the Trent Reznor original is a wall of sound and angst. This is about as flat, emotionless, and just plain boring as it gets. The song sounds confused as to what it is supposed to sound like, there aren't enough effects to fill the empty spaces, which just makes it sound hollow and like it was recorded by a crappy college band who is just learning to play their instruments. Draimen's singing is even worse, he screws up a lyric in the first verse, it doesn't feel like any of the songs lyrics actually resonate with him, and he completely abandons the breakdown verse ""I want to, but I can't go back"". It really is just uninspired, it's definitely by no means ""Industrial-Metal"" (and I really wish everyone would stop calling it that.), and it really doesn't add anything to the value of the song. Orgy's version of Blue Monday is the perfect example of how to cover a song, it sounds different but within the same vein as the New Order original, it sounds like Jay Gordon actually relates to the lyrics. This is a bastardized version of Wish and is just more proof that most bands really shouldn't cover NIN, when Linkin Park does a better cover of a song than your band does, you know you are in trouble. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
never ordered it <SEP> i never order this ---- it just showed on my account.  beware of bogus orders to our accounty.  help stop orders
A major irritant in a minor key. <SEP> Full of warbling opera & choir in German that rambles endlessly--my dogs leave the room when I play this--as opposed to Mozart Big Box which we all love. I deleted all of the singing in this collection for that reason.
"where's the value <SEP> Purchased this several months ago and have tried to download with no success. Attempted to contact customer service and received absolutely no response. a

Can't judge the true value because I never was able to listen to the item."
"$1.29? Really? <SEP> Love Stone Sour. Love Corey.  Heard beginning of Blue Smoke on radio, thought it held promise, immediately went to Amazon to purchase. Jokes on me.  It's not a full track at all.  It's more like an intro.  Would have been nice to be given the head's up on that.  Or better yet, it should not be listed as a choice to buy.  Live and learn."
It's free? Awesome! <SEP> I was so pleasantly surprised that this song was included on this album!! Thanks!! I like this mix and I can't believe it's free!
"pretty good album <SEP> I've been a postal service fan for years, and since this is their only real album, aside from a few singles, that says everything there is"
"So bad, they're good. <SEP> I found Gloryhammer on Youtube a bit over a year ago, listening to what I - not entirely wrongly - thought would be some worn-out, cliched fantasy rock.  That's what it was, bad, trope-ridden, and yes, cliched fantasy.  But Gloryhammer embraces it all, and through their passion and energy, not to mention their solid skill as musicians, they make it something cool. Something fun.  Something so bad it's good.  These guys are great."
Five Stars <SEP> This is my favourite CD. I love it.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
Energizing <SEP> Bonobo always delivers. The whole album may be a stretch to purchase but a few songs a worth the buy.
Five Stars <SEP> great tune
"ONLY FOR  RELIGIUOS PEOPLE <SEP> i m dissapointed , alvaro toores has been a singer  with romantic songs  , but this  CD  is only b for cristian people . IT not has  songs of love (only love for god)"
"She is trying to brainwash you. She is in ... <SEP> She is trying to brainwash you. She is in the illuminati, this is not a joke. Please open your eyes people for your sake."
"Beyonce Never dissapointed her Fans <SEP> I always like Beyonce''She has never disappointed me..No matter what she comes up with,she has the unique voice to pull it off. Every of her Album excites me. People say she is trying to emulate Tina Turner. There is nothing bad in that. You have to look up to someone mostly if the person will be of great influence to your career. But i don't think she sounds any close to Tina. They both have their different uniqueness"
"Doesn't Run The World <SEP> There is no question that when it has came down to female artists, Beyonce' Knowles has honestly been the most overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly and definitely the quality of her voice in her songs and her has slowly withered away from the heart, largely because she has been more of a product than a strong singer. Musically, she has been trying to follow-up the smash success she had with Single Ladies, but honestly the songs that she came out with after I Am... Sasha Fierce have definitely been a waste of time from her heart. Also, with a remixed version of songs Run The World (Girls) from the lackluster 4 album, sounds much cheaper and pathetic from each and every beat. Beyonce' Knowles should really find better from her own voice, and then she could run the world.

Song: D"
love this song <SEP> One of my favorite songs
"oh great a math problem <SEP> oh great a math problem 1+1=2
Looks like she didn't graduate high school.
wake up or retire. You have out run your spotlight.
Go get my albums instead , you'll thank me later."
Great for Exercise playlist <SEP> Great for exercise playlist. The beat is awesome!
"Blown Out <SEP> When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has honestly been the most overexposed product in voice and song. Not only that, but with each and every record she has done the quality of her voice has withered slowly away. Her latest album doesn't really ignite, and the songs from her last album 4 were not very good at all. Countdown, which was one of her singles from that album absolutely lost its sheen in voice and song. She really didn't actually ignite a rhythm, in the way she did with her songs earlier in her career like Crazy In Love and Naughty Girl. I absolutely wasn't even impressed with the song at all. It felt more like a waste of time and quality with what she had before. Perhaps she needs to grow up and have a more mature sound to count up to, than just try and be too much of a product to count up with.

Song: D"
classic <SEP> this track is the epitome of Joe Bonamassa's style and craft; I'm downloading more of his music now and making my own Greatest Hits.
One Star <SEP> Not a Beyonce fan.  Had to have it for a wedding
Often Hard to distinquish one Beyonce song from the other <SEP> I heard it on Pandora and thought that I'd like it if I heard it more.....wrong....sounds like most of her up tempo songs with very little in the way of depth or verve...
"I can't stand this song, but Beyonce fans are ... <SEP> I can't stand this song, but Beyonce fans are inappropriaiely aggressive about hearing her songs at the club so I needed something to shut them up."
My favorite song on this album <SEP> I love it and play it over and over.  Favorite on the acoustic album.  Maybe it's the words and or the music
"Great <SEP> I have to admit, this is the ONLY beyonce song i listen to. there is just something about this song that makes me love it. its so real"
One Star <SEP> doesn't lift
Great Listening! <SEP> You can't go wrong with Joe!  Get this for more good listening.  PBS did a great show with him also.
"One Star <SEP> This sucks. I was trying to buy stoner metal, but I guess something went wrong."
Five Stars <SEP> Nice song to party too.
"Great Live Outlaws From The Mid-80s <SEP> THE OUTLAWS LIVE @ THE BAYOU APRIL 21 1985 is a great live recording by the Outlaws from a period when very little was released. Henry Paul had returned to the band, and they were playing songs from their entire catalog, including several that never made it onto any of their studio albums, as well as songs from the Henry Paul Band's catalog. Guitarist Steve Grisham was a great replacement for Billy Jones, and drummer David Dix was really playing well. Anyone who loves the Outlaws should own this CD."
"808all-day <SEP> I was just hearing this jam on he radio the other day and I must say another one of my best jams out there. Jordan t, you gimme some feeling and I definetly gon watch the sunset tonight."
Ballin nice club banger <SEP> I seen this video with Fat Joe in it and he has lost a substantial amount of weight and looks good.  The song is nice and the beat will have you dancing in the club.  Check it out!
One Star <SEP> Not the version I thought it would be.
Five Stars <SEP> great album!
"bad download <SEP> recorded to disc with error, so was very displeased with it. I don't know if I ever had a bad download prior to this one."
I like the CD and song arrangements <SEP> I like the CD and song arrangements.  I like the group that sings the song.  I will listen to it more
WARNING TO POTENTIAL BUYERS! <SEP> This album was ripped at the lowest possible bit rate and so the sound quality is absolutely awful. Do not buy this!
"Excellent for singing with or just listening to <SEP> Excellent worship song, great arrangement of music. It is easy to sing with, or just to listen to as well."
"Just okay <SEP> It was okay, I love the melody but the words just didn't catch me as I thought the sound would"
One Star <SEP> only like 5 songs and its normal nursery rhymes not barney songs.
Awesome <SEP> I love this album.  Jon delivers again! Southern Paradise is like a summer anthem. He never disappoints. It gets you in the mood to dance. Has a great energy to it.
Makes Me Shake My Pom Poms <SEP> Love this song! It's gets me moving and shaking each time it plays.
"Loved this series, and love Katharine McPhee <SEP> Loved this series, and love Katharine McPhee"
Awesome new talent!! <SEP> This guy has a terrific pure voice that you just want to sit and listen to all day.  The tune is very catchy and I can't wait for him to come out with more songs.  He definately could be the next big thing in country music.
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
Five Stars <SEP> Tamale!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> great
"An Joyless Exercise in Recording <SEP> Perhaps this album is a technical tour de force, but hearing music written to be sung by God's people gathered together in a body instead performed by a single voice run through a machine gave me no pleasure."
"This is a beautiful song. Michael McDonald <SEP> This is a beautiful song. Michael McDonald, Paul Anka with George Benson, who knew?  Their voices blend so well and the guitar. George Benson an added pleasure, time well spent. Great Music lives on."
Five Stars <SEP> fun
One Star <SEP> I didn't order this
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful duet by two of my favorite singers
AKB48 Sayonara Crawl!! <SEP> Great product! Condition very very good! Is like a new item so im really happy to have rhis cd amd it came on time! Everything was awesome!
Mr. Bond has grasped the essence of the Blues! <SEP> Mr. Bond's musical tribulations seem to capture the conditions felt by many a man in modern marriage. Too bad he has turned to the devil's brew to cope. Excellent finger-picking style. Only one question: are you really James Bond?
There is some great music on this disc. <SEP> This is just highlights. I guess there is a 2 disc offering with some of the songs I was hoping would be on this.
Horrible remastering. <SEP> Completely terrible remaster. See if you van find the Virgin cd instead.
One Star <SEP> terrible not a good cd at all.
One Star <SEP> until i see track list
great song!!! <SEP> My wife found this and now i'm in love with it! Its a really good sing to get into. Buy it! You won't regret it!
"Best song from a game soundtrack! <SEP> My favorite song, it has to be the best one from the soundtrack!"
"AMAZING!!!  Paper Bird is the BEST!! <SEP> I love Paper BIrd.  Their sound is unique and so full of joy.  This newest album, Rooms, is filled with stunning harmonies and interesting instrumentation.  All their albums are good, but this one shows how they have evolved since their incarnation.  After listening, I feel uplifted.  This band deserves to be listened to and I can't recommend this album enough.  You will not be disappointed."
"My baby and I love this CD <SEP> My baby and I love this CD!!  She smiles, dances, and tries to sing along - and I do, too!"
... and the voice and background music isn't all that great <SEP> It's missing some of the Classic Italian songs I grew up with and the voice and background music isn't all that great
"Very disappointed, I wish I had returned it before opening ... <SEP> Most of the songs are not children songs. Very disappointed, I wish I had returned it before opening the package."
I would not recommend this for learning Italian <SEP> The songs were not sung very clearly and it was difficult to make out the Italian words. I would not recommend this for learning Italian.
"Some songs are originals! <SEP> My husband is a native Filipino and he stated that most songs are English songs translated Tagalog, but one or two songs are original
Tagalog songs. The original songs are most enjoyed by our children & will sing songs till their hearts are content. I love, love hearing them!"
Five Stars <SEP> Absolutely wonderful
Smoothly magic <SEP> So smooth so good!
One Star <SEP> Did not like this version
don't like <SEP> got this song for my sister I did not like it it's not all that don't like the song at all
"good boost during work outs <SEP> I never saw the movie, but this track was used in the end of a boxing documentary about Mayweather vs Pacquaio (here: https://youtu.be/hF76dlQt23c?t=3131)

Inspiring, good boost during work outs."
"loved it, the whole soundtrack is great <SEP> loved it , the whole soundtrack is great!!!!"
"We live in a Senior Living Facility. After supper ... <SEP> We live in a Senior Living Facility. After supper - most nights - we gather to sing the popular songs of our generation (1940 +++) Some of us need a reminder of the words (great for memory retention) If anyone can provide us with such a book its Amazon. I will purchase the 40's - A Sentimental Journey for a start. Amazon I am a Prime customet and my name and
Email are in your records - GloriaMerrill@comcast.net. Thank you."
"This release is decent to dance around the house to <SEP> I'm an old school FL club kid, and mondo is one of the DJ's from my youth. This release is decent to dance around the house to"
Misordered the wrong one <SEP> Not the MP3 I was trying to order. Ordered by mistake. Waste of money and time for this one! Uggg!
"stunning and timely my all time fav. <SEP> What a timely piece of music this is. It speaks to everyone . The world has become a difficult place to live in and we all must be strong and endure. This song tells of love and peace in spite of it all. Brad Paisley makes it a personal  quest for his love is strong enough to make his world where you want to be.
Carolyn Valence"
Good <SEP> Good
Two Stars <SEP> bad start to song
It's Brad <SEP> Lets just start by saying it's Brad Paisley what isn't to like.? I like almost all of his songs and this one surely didn't disappoint.
Beautiful voices <SEP> One of my favorite gospel songs. Absolutely beautiful!
"I do not like too much how to interpret Joshua Bell <SEP> I do not like too much how to interpret Joshua Bell. When I decided to buy this compilation I did because it contains truly original recordings, such as the arrangement for violin and piano by Leopold Auer of Waldszenen, Op 82. The Prophet Bird of Robert Schumann. The download page reported that the recordings were in mp3 format. Once downloaded suffered a great disappointment that the bitrate of these is at 128 kps. I think there is general agreement as to the lossy format recordings must be at least 192 kps in order to the human ear was not capable of appreciating difference in quality compared to the original CD. This becomes more necessary with regard to classical music. At least I've had to suffer the typical sound tinny in the treble passages. I wish that Amazon's people had enough sensitivity to obviate this inconvenience and compensate me sometime."
"Too abstract <SEP> I bought this thinking it would be just wonderful....well it could be if one liked to listen to selections you have never heard before or ever heard of. There were a few I would have liked to enjoy but I couldn't get to them before being so overwhelmed by abstract pieces so that my brain was tired by the time I got there.... which I never did. I got a rare refund from Amazon. Be careful buying MP3's b'cuz once you do, you are stuck with them unless you happen to spends literally hundreds a year here..... which I do. Thanks Amazon for having a heart."
Five Stars <SEP> Nice catchy tune.
"Great Song by an even better Singer <SEP> Don't Cry for Me Argentina has always been one of my favorites. I recently began listening to Katherine Jenkins and to my plesant suprise foud her recording of this song.

The song and the Artist made my day in terms of listening enjoyment."
"Fantastic Artist! <SEP> Heard him live at Festival International 2014 in Lafayette,  Louisiana.  Great sound. Engaging music. Bought the album via smartphone while in the audience. Love this mus I!"

"I did not get it, <SEP> I didn't received this Boney James.. please check this out.  I paid for it I would appreciate it for someone to look into it."
"Smooth Jazz <SEP> Boney James smoothing out a Stevie Wonder track...Priceless! A Latin vibe, Boney's sax melts like butter on on toast on this track!"
dont you worry bout a thing <SEP> This is musical only folks though it don't tell you that anywhere. But even though it's awesome. You'll truely love it. Sometimes you don't need the words.
"Five Stars <SEP> I love the plaintive mood it sets, somehow very romantic."
Five Stars <SEP> beautiful

"very good act <SEP> she is a really good comedian, she easy to listen to no matter what nationality you are. Would recommend to anyone."
"From MainlyPiano <SEP> ""Opus Four"" is a collection of thirteen original piano solos by Tim Neumark. For those not familiar with music terminology, an opus number is traditionally assigned to a composer's work to put it in chronological order. Those numbers aren't used as much in contemporary music as they were historically, but since this is Neumark's fourth CD, the title is fitting and appropriate. (The piano teacher in me couldn't resist explaining that!) As with Neumark's previous albums, the music on this one was inspired by experiences and emotions, and being a new dad has brought about quite a few inspiring moments as well! There is a variety of musical styles and moods on this album, but most of the pieces are gentle, uncomplicated, and very sincere - an uplifting hour of beautiful solo piano. Pianists will be happy to know that a companion songbook is on its way - available now to download and coming soon in hard copy.

""Opus Four"" begins with ""With Wonder,"" a charming piece that conveys the innocence and simplicity of seeing the world through a child's eyes. The gently flowing tempo and uncomplicated melody line make this a warmly welcoming first track. ""Dad's Victory"" commemorates Neumark's father's final chemo treatment and victory over cancer. Far from being a cinematic victory march, this piece expresses relief, hope, and a very deep love. Neumark says in the liner notes that ""Waltz in F Minor"" is the first piece of music he has released simply for the sake of the music. Bittersweet and elegant, it's a favorite. ""A Moment of Joy"" is a short, effervescent happy dance. ""Winter Dreams"" is another favorite - on the dark side at the beginning, the mood lightens as the piece evolves. ""Persian Rhapsody"" is quite different. With an exotic Middle Eastern flavor, this eight-minute exploration is sometimes playful, sometimes reflective, sometimes flowing, and sometimes energetic - always very enjoyable. ""Two Hearts"" was inspired by  the first time Neumark saw an ultrasound of his daughter's beating heart. Tender and loving with a suggestion of excitement and anticipation, this is another highlight of the album. ""Adagio Sostenuto"" has a strong classical influence and Neumark keeps this passionate beauty understated and graceful - love it! ""Seattle Nocturne"" is another favorite. Recreated from an improvisation performed at Piano Haven Studio (in Seattle at the time), it is a very open, relaxing piece that conveys feelings of longing and introspection. Neumark has included a meditation piece on each album, and this time ""Skipping Stones"" is that piece. ""Chasing Glory"" is the most upbeat and energetic track on the album and is meant to capture the feeling of the Olympic Games as well as the joy and excitement of competition - a buoyant close to ""Opus 4.""

Fans of Tim Neumark's first three albums will find much to savor with ""Opus Four,"" and for those who are new to his music, this is a great place to start!  Recommended!"
"Keep doing your thing Boney <SEP> I love Boney...He continues to make great music and will always.  Please come back to Dallas, TX we love you."
"Not what I was looking for. <SEP> There is a song they play on the Disney Channel that is really fun called Me and My Girls.  This is not it.  Unfortunately, I can only find it on you tube and no where is it available to purchase yet :("
disappointed <SEP> I was disappointed with this purchase. I was expecting a copycat version. Should have pre-viewed. Needed a recording for a dance contest.
Two jazz giants <SEP> Don Goldie'so trumpet solo on Basin Street Blues is worth the price of the cd.
Five Stars <SEP> Love love love....Have been and will continue to be in love with his voice!
Terrible recording. I was hoping these were hymns sung ... <SEP> Terrible recording. I was hoping these were hymns sung by Joni but instead there are only 2 that she sings.
"Love Joni and the old classic hymns <SEP> Since I love Joni, and the old, classic hymns, this is only better giving the history and background of hymns, including music.  I pray these old jewels of Biblical wisdom stay alive - they certainly speak to my heart."
Five Stars <SEP> great song
"RIPOFF, lame session band. <SEP> This are NOT the original artists, just some lame studio session band.  I couldn't see the name at the bottom of the small icon, so I didn't know.  DON'T make the same mistake I did.  Run from this album.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  RIPOFF!!!"
"ad libbing? <SEP> Yes, Uncle Bob records everything...which increases the possibility of laying down some tracks that could be good songs if reworked.  I didn't care for any of the tunes on this side project, but I only had one listen.  Its true that there are Pollard tunes that just magically appear in your head all of a sudden and this is his magic.  My initial reaction to this one is negative.  But I just got this a couple of days before English Little League and after the series of short eps that preceded English LL.  Only because I idolize Robert Pollard will I give this another chance."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song!
"BIRTH OF A SALESMAN: the quintessential HOW-TO-SELL experience! <SEP> BIRTH OF A SALESMAN by Carson V. Heady is the only book of its kind to not only be a fantastic how-to book, better than anything I have ever read, but it doubles as a fictional story about the book-within-the-book's author.

The how-to sell portion is not like any other; it is laced with entertaining pop culture references and humor to keep it popping and, all the while, goes in-depth to the selling game. Heady uses actual scripting and verbiage and real-life scenarios to paint a picture for every occasion, talking about how to interview for the sales job, how to open a call or visit, fact-find, pitch, close, overcome...and even how to get promoted and how to manage people when you get there. He covers all the bases and clearly speaks from great experience.

On top of that, you get a fantastic story about a young man forging his mark on a corrupt division of a typical Corporate America-type company. The character - Vincent Scott - is a champion of the people and is reviled by the shady characters he stands up against. His horrible racist and dictator of a boss is the antagonist of the story, and, as it begins, he is under an ethics investigation prompted by the mutiny by the entire management team.

This is a must-read. Because it has the added elements of humor and fun and it doubles as a quality conspiracy fiction story about a realistic hero we can identify with, it is the greatest how-to-sell book in history."
"One Star <SEP> There are no words, it is only backkground music."
"and you know this is a love story, although a good one <SEP> Oh, please. I've had a girlfriend, and you know this is a love story, although a good one."
"One Star <SEP> deleted it, not my kind of music"
"Sheela Blue Rudi Rammler <SEP> Ich finde den Song ""Rudi Rammler"" von Sheela Blue spitzte. Der ist lustig und macht gute Laune. Kann ich nur empfehlen.
I love the Song ""Rudi Rammler"" by Sheela Blue. It's a really funny Song. Love this product. Also the other Sheela Bue Songs are very good. Try it!"
Fantastic <SEP> First heard of Crywolf on Pandora. I'm so glad I did. I really enjoy their music. I play this album a lot.
Love <SEP> This ep is truly amazing one of the best bands i've heard in a really long time even more amazing live this ep is a must have :)
"Talented new pop artist <SEP> Enjoyed hearing something different...even if he's only 19 yrs old, and from England!! His music has been out for a couple years and is becoming more popular daily!!"
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song. Classic 90's track takes me back to high school.
Two Stars <SEP> This is a classic  from the eighties!
"Listen to the words. <SEP> Love the man just because he's him - not because he's the entertainer. Poignant, and the Temptations are real good with that. Listen for the uplift near the end where you hear them all converge on the note, and when Melvin brings in that deep, deep bass. Classic Temptations!"
Love It <SEP> Love It
Five Stars <SEP> I love this. I use it to help me with my migraine headaches.
"Doesn't download correctly <SEP> Dr. Bernie Siegel is great and this meditation is great, however the download does not work. The first meditation works fine, but 1/4 of the way through the second meditation it skips to the middle of the first meditation. It repeats this twice more. I downloaded several times, on my desktop and iphone, but has the same glitch."
Brian Haney is an amazing singer & piano player <SEP> Brian Haney is an amazing singer and piano player.  He get into the songs and truly blesses you as he sings he knows what he is singing about.
Five Stars <SEP> I love the purity of spirit that shines through Daniela's voice.
Dont buy <SEP> Awful do not purchase this. I do not know what else to say. This is rediculous that I have to input so many words before I can leave a review.
"Love this! <SEP> I had heard this song a while back and immediately wanted to purchase it. I couldn't find it when I first looked, so I was so happy to find it on this live recording. Love it!"
"Beautiful tribute to life and to his daughter <SEP> I love this song.  There's a video on YouTube that goes with it, too.  It brings tears to my eyes as I think of this girl who was almost thrown away, but at the last minute her Mom chose life.  The fact that it's based on the true story of his adopted daughter makes this song even more powerful."
"R is for Wrong item. <SEP> O.K. I've ordered this item a couple times thinking that it's the Compact Disc. And it comes back as a Mary Poppins paperback book, or something like that. I don't know WHAT the deal is here!"
"WARNING titles all wrong <SEP> Big problem. The song titles are all wrong. If you download ""In a Monastery Garden"" you will get ""Dancing Check to Check."" How do I get my $0.89 back?"
"Loving this cd. <SEP> I have really been enjoying this cd. I think Dudley plugged Billy Gibbons into one side of his brain and David Gilmour into the other, put pick to guitar and out came this album. Very listenable, whether driving in the car or cooking in the kitchen. I'll let you know if I get tired of it but I don't see that happening anytime in the next few years because this cd doesn't have that here-today-gone-tomorrow sound to it. It's going to stay on the front shelf, if you know what I mean."
Song is great but can't listen to it <SEP> Purchased but never downloaded.  Song is great but can't listen to it.
Volbeat story song. <SEP> Great story in this one. Terrific riffs on the guitar.
Great tune <SEP> Has an old school hardcore feel. Fun song.
Awesome! <SEP> Rocking tune!
Good tune <SEP> Classic metal sound
Five Stars <SEP> Such a lovely classic song.
"ROCKS!! <SEP> Great song. First heard this on Liquid Metal, and really wanted to get a copy of it. Enjoy it loud!"
"Just buy it!  It is that good! <SEP> I buy a lot of music.  Very few albums grab me like this one did on my first listen.  Besides a few whisper vocals, this album is all instrumental, but it is so well done, you don't need vocals.  The music says plenty!
It is so good, I find it hard to believe that this is their first album. I am kinda sad there isn't more from them to go buy.  I have had it playing constantly since I bought it.  Take a listen to the previews.  They are just a bit of the greatness which lies on the rest of the album.  BUY IT NOW!!  You won't be disappointed."
Worth it. <SEP> This is a really good album.
"Schlafes Bruder vs. E Nomine <SEP> Schlafes Bruder is a music project founded by Christian Weller and Friedrich Graner, previously the core members of the German band E Nomine.  According to Weller and Graner, Schlafes Bruder is the ""revolution of E Nomine"". While the music on ""Heute War Gott Nicht Hier"" is clearly taking a new approach, there are many similarities to the musical style of E Nomine, including the intermingling of hardrock music and Latin choirs. However, instead of using the voices of German actors that are responsible for dubbed voiceovers in movies, the main singing voice is now Graner. Overall, the musical style now sounds more like a cross-over between E Nomine and Rammstein.

My favorite songs on this album (and they are my favorite because they sound like they could be from E Nomine) are Heilig, Absolution, and Erdenblut. There are a few weak tracks on this album as well, which is why I felt compelled to remove a Star from my rating (the songs I don't like are Thusnelda, Ich bin Liebe, Ritter und Knecht).

I am really excited about this re-vamping of E Nomine. Even though it is different I think that the musical styles are similar enough that if you enjoy one of these two bands, you will like the counterpart as well. I can't wait for more!

If you are unsure whether this is for you, most of the songs are uploaded in their entirety on YouTube, so you can prelisten to the whole thing prior to purchasing. Unfortunately, Amazon.com currently only offers the mp3 version of this album. If you are like me and prefer a hard copy, the CD is available on www.amazon.de or sometimes on eBay, as well."
The Greatest Song Since Sliced Bread <SEP> This is an amazing jam. All I want to do is jump in a pool of water on a hot Summer day.
"Thanks Imee! <SEP> Heart chakra music. Pure Metta here, folks."
"Not gay OR party! <SEP> If there was such a thing as gay elevator music, this would be it. It's inconsceiveable  to an old queen like me that you would hear this music at any gay bar or party. I'm really suspicious some shady character found some s*** and called it gay just to rip us off."
"Photographer does it again! <SEP> This guy's bringing back banging trance to it's roots! I'm sick of the all this cheesy ""trouse"" crap that producers are calling ""trance"" these days."
Lovely meditation or sleep music <SEP> I would have given it 5 stars but track 2 has a chant. I find certain voices get me agitated when trying to relax..however I deleted the track from the Kindle download and alls good.
POP or Hip Hop .. I'm not sure! <SEP> But just about the first of this type of music that I found that I really liked.  Now I listen to this genre' of music all the time.  And this is definitely on my kindle :-)
"This is one of my most favorite chanting as it was the lord Bhudda taught to ... <SEP> Absolutely, lovely.  This is one of my most favorite chanting as it was the lord Bhudda taught to his disciples. The meaning is absolutely wonderful so loving and kindness.  It has been said this chanting will protect you. I listen to it each night to till sleep. Gave me the best sleep.

Love everything about this album."
Five Stars <SEP> EXCELLENT!
"There are only two two minute songs on this CD <SEP> I Love Kacey Musgraves and buy every album she puts out, but this one only has two songs yet it sells for full price. Not what I expected."
"One Star <SEP> $10 for a CD 'single'?!? Ridiculous! (Yes, the songs are good)"
Great <SEP> Great song
Five Stars <SEP> This puts me right to sleep.
Not the radio version song - I have to re-buy it <SEP> It isn't the radio version.. I have to find the right one and buy it again..the short preview sounded right.
"Who listed this as country <SEP> OK, the country genre has been on a freight train to oblivion, drowning with rock and pop, now they are rapping, are you aware country + rap = CRAP, and that is what I think of this!
Nashville sold out country music, cut out it's heart and soul!"
It is truly a fantastic and beautiful score! <SEP> Great music! It is truly a fantastic and beautiful score!
Five Stars <SEP> Excellent album
Blues Raver <SEP> Smoking guitar work by Anna and a high intensity vocal to go with it. Tight instrumentation throughout. This tune keeps spinning for me.
"CD Is A Dinosaur By Today's Standards <SEP> This is one of those CDs that flooded the market at the dawn of the digital age which simply converted a long-standing vinyl LP to the new format to take advantage of the initial novelty, featuring minimal tracks (usually 10 to 12 but some with as few as 8) and complete lack of liner notes and contents discography. And even as a vinyl LP in the early 1960s the title was totally incorrect because half of the cuts were not among his ""greatest hits"" - certainly not if you consider a ""hit"" something that made the national Billboard singles charts.

Of the six that are here, some are among the best of their day, beginning with the opening track - The Theme From ""A Summer Place"" from the film starring Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee - which shot to # 1 on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 early in 1960 and spent NINE weeks there b/w Go-Go-Po-Go as Columbia 41490. It even made a significant impact on the R&B charts, reaching # 2. Till was among his lesser hits, only managing a # 63 in the spring of 1957 as Columbia 40826 b/w The Last Dance, while Delicado was his initial # 1, hitting that spot in the spring of 1952 featuring harpsichordist Stan Freeman as Columbia 39708 b/w Festival. The Song From Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart?), even outdid A Summer Place, spending TEN weeks at # 1 in May-June 1953. featuring the lovely voice of Felicia Sanders as Columbia 39944 b/w Swedish Rhapsody (Midsummer Vigil), which also charted at # 21. All My Love, adapted from the French song Bolero, became his second hit single when it reached # 7 Sept-Oct 1950 as Columbia 38918 b/w This Is The Time.

But that's it insofar as his ""greatest hits"" are concerned when it comes to this release. They Can't Take That Away From Me was released twice without becoming a hit, the first time in 1950 b/w If I Had A Magic Carpet as Columbia 38862, and again in late 1953 as the flip of Non Dimenticar (which also failed to chart by the way) as Columbia 40155. Other failed singles include Jamaican Rhumba, which also was issued twice in 1952, first as Columbia 39784 b/w Oye Negra, and then as Columbia 39790 b/w Da Du, and Tropical Merengue which was a 1955 release b/w We Won't Say Goodbye as Columbia 40543. The Syncopated Clock was indeed a 1951 hit - but not for Percy but rather for Leroy Anderson as well as The Boston Pops Orchestra. Percy's rendition was the uncharted flip of the # 10 On Top Of Old Smoky, with vocal by Burl Ives as Columbia 39328. Similarly, The Rain In Spain, from My Fair Lady, was the uncharted B-side to the # 82 minor hit, With A Little Bit Of Luck (also from My Fair Lady) in summer 1956 as Columbia 40696. However, neither hit is included here.

Legitimate hits overlooked are: I Cross My Fingers, with vocal by Russ Emery which reached # 20 in July 1950 b/w Valencia as Columbia 38786; Christmas In Killarney with The Shillelagh Singers, a # 28 in Dec 1950 b/w Norah as Columbia 39048; the double-sided hit When The Saints Go Marching In (# 29) b/w I Want To Be Near You (# 30) as Columbia 39528 in Sept 1951; Return To Paradise - Parts 1 & 11, a # 19 in June 1953 as Columbia 39998; Many Times, a # 30 in Dec 1953 b/w In Love as Columbia 40076; Dream, Dream. Dream - a # 25 in May 1954 b/w Eleanora as Columbia 40185; The Bandit, from the Mexican film O Cangaceiro, a # 25 in Oct 1954 b/w Rainfall as Columbia 40323; Valley Valparaiso, a # 53 in Feb 1956 b/w Bluebell as Columbia 40633; We All Need Love, a # 67 in April 1956 b/w Carmellita as Columbia 40644; and Theme For Young Lovers, a # 35 in June 1960 b/w Bimini Goombay as Columbia 41655.

With the advent of the Adult Contemporary charts in late 1961, Percy would go on to add another nine to those charts from 1967 to 1975 (see Comments below).

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on April 7, 1908, Percy passed away in his 68th year on February 9, 1976."

Five Stars <SEP> Love it!! Thank you!
Not the song i wanted <SEP> I bought it because of a video on tv that said that was the one with i will be home for christmas. And that song was not there
Great great great group. <SEP> I love them and everyone should know this group.

Five Stars <SEP> I love Mythos
"I can honestly say that TROMBORANGA is currently my favorite salsa band <SEP> I been listening to Salsa my whole life, over 40 years; as my father and uncles are avid Salseros. I grew up listening to Fania, Willie Colon, Hector Lavoe, Ismael Rivera, Oscar DLeon & Dimension Latina, Ruben Blades, Sonora Poncea, Grand Combo and more.

I can honestly say that TROMBORANGA is currently my favorite salsa band, they are that good! Discalimer: Im NOT comparing them to the giants above, Im merely referencing were my opinions are coming from.

While listening to a salsa Mix from DJ Lobo at work, one song made me snap out of autopilot Humildad, I realized that the name of the band was Tromboranga, so I went to YouTube and listing to Alabanciosa, Adios Que Te Vaya Bien, Agua Que Va Caer and Amigo El Raton Del Queso

After that I went straight to Amazon and bought all 4 CDs at once based on those 5 songs and cant stop listening to them ever since. There is something about this band that I simply love! The sounds is so clean, elegant, melodic yet strong! Vocal are excellent and the trombones, oh the trombones are just phenomenal.

I had the pleasure to see them perform live recently during the 2015 USA tour and they sounded as good as the CD if not better. These are real musicians and their passion for their craft shows and is felt by the audience. They all perform solos and their skills were evident after the first few seconds. Talking to most of the band members after the show I was even more impressed by how humble and friendly they were!

TROMBORANGA is the real deal"
sage <SEP> Sage is so kind and wonderful to his fans.  He accepts everyone for who they are and I love him for that.  He takes the time to get to know his fans where alot of entertainers do not do that.  SAGE I LOVE YOU AND WANT TO SEE YOU AT THE MN STATE FAIR IN 2014
"Very disappointing <SEP> I don't like to put down small local bands, but this band needs something. A real vocalist to start with."
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!!
"Awesome tracks! <SEP> Very well made instrumental. I recommend them every chance I get to choirs without musicians, performers, or just people who like sing."
not pleased <SEP> the complete song did not download as listed only the sample downloaded. I was not pleased and its a very cute song.
"Classic modern rock ! <SEP> Great performances here from some of N.Y.C.s  rock alumni , Well crafted insightful songs classic rock lovers will love !  Check these guys out ,"
0nly 19 seconds long at .99 is ridiculous! <SEP> 0nly 19 seconds long at .99 is ridiculous!  not worth the money for a sound you could record your self for a lot longer.
Five Stars <SEP> Great song for our church service
This was a terrible buy <SEP> There was only one song on it when I thought that it was her new album. The song didn't even play!
"So much feeling <SEP> The song is great. It has a lot of feeling and soul in it. Honestly, I was in the same situation and it just made me think. The first time I heard All In My Head on youtube, I cried because that's exactly how I felt and sometimes still feel."
Amazing <SEP> I loved the whole thing. Listen and love it! Oliver's voice is to amazing to miss. Listen to the whole album it's gotten me through some rough times.
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome
"Great Song <SEP> good driving tune, Ii put in with my kevin fowler and john slaughter tunes...also makes for a good partying song as well"
Love this song <SEP> I love to listen to this song. I think this song might an indication of this band having a big potential. Will definitely watch their progress.
I paid $12 for this album and i can't even ... <SEP> I paid $12 for this album and i can't even listen to it. I can't even find it. Refund please.
Five Stars <SEP> love it
"Screamo at it's best <SEP> This is how screamo should sound. The singing is absolutely amazing and unlike most bands of the genre. The guitar work is well done and works perfectly as a bridge between the rhythm section and the vocals. The only problem that I have with this album is that the screamer doesn't really scream very often. Most of what he does is more of a yell or whine but it works with the music so I can ignore it. If you do not yet own this CD, buy it now!

The best song in my opinion is Look Alive but every song is excellent"
False advertising and a waste of money. <SEP> Don't buy this.  NOT the original film soundtracks or scores.  The jacket makes this album look as if the Coen Brothers themselves released these tracks.  Amazon ought to be ashamed of itself for selling this thing without an explanation or disclaimer. False advertising and a waste of money.
One Star <SEP> Poorly poorly done.
"Sinatra's jazz side <SEP> This rendition joins
My sweet loraine and 'Sposin as one of the efforts where sinatra's jazz side comes out the strongest.
A corny song which reveals how good a jazz singer sinatra might have become."
AWESOME CD!!! <SEP> This is the best music I've been able to listen to in over 20 years. Usually after a few minutes most music will give me a severe ear ache. Not this by Scott Haskins. I can listen to it all day. No problem. It is so soothing and relaxing you won't believe it. I have it on in the background most of the day. I have never heard such amazing music.  I will definitely be buying Mental and Mental III and anything else that Scott produces. It's just that good. I was gifted this music by the author with no expectation.
blues <SEP> great song
"Essence Lost <SEP> Either I am confused about the score for the end credits, or this is a very poor excuse for trying to capture the essence of the thematic score from Fargo. Sorry to have it take up space in my collection."
"Dying Young <SEP> This song is awesome & catchy.  Too bad that is a rarity for Vampire Weekend, regardless...they nailed it on this one."
"HORRIBLE! This is an almost completely MONO version of ... <SEP> HORRIBLE! This is an almost completely MONO version of the amazing (original) track used in the film. HORRIBLE sound (""pancaked,"" with minimal dynamics... and all the gorgeous tone sucked out of the track). The numerous versions on YouTube sound 100 times better. I would like a refund. What a SHAME Carter Burwell's amazing piece for this fantastic film is getting shat upon here. Really would like a refund... SHAMEFUL!!!!!!"
"Haunting close to a haunting movie <SEP> The audio track here is slightly different from the actual track in the movie, but still has the quiet unsettling feeling that closed this divisive but definitive movie.  This was the only music in the movie, and suited the material well."
Four Stars <SEP> Hayley has such a good voice!
please help <SEP> wont let me download
Five Stars <SEP> great
Two Stars <SEP> not what I wanted it's instrumental I wanted lyrics
Great!! <SEP> Great!!!
One Star <SEP> NOT royalty free as indicated.  If you try to use this on your youtube videos it will get flagged.
"Beautiful Music!!! <SEP> This compilation of songs is beautifully executed. Kennedy and Bush have supernatural vocal synergy and perform with passion and clarity. The music and production are flawless.
Highest recommendation!!!"
Repugnant <SEP> What were they thinking? This CD contains numerous remixes of a song which wasn't good to begin with. Save your money and your ears!
"actual recording & music great <SEP> Actual CD is fantastic. Amazon however butchers the sound, and I made a complaint. hopefully they will correct the problem soon."
"Check this track out! <SEP> There's a lot of simple tracks out there that just fall into the mainstream category of EDM but this track really stands out. It's relieving to hear a track that doesn't follow the typical ""verse-build-drop"" and repeats it. I love the changes that this song goes through and how it constantly brings in new elements till the very end.

This track is FAR from boring (some songs I change after 30 seconds of listening to them haha) and shows an original blend of genres. Worth checking out!"
"Heartbreaking <SEP> There is some great music on this CD, but the production is awful. The sound quality makes this album too difficult to enjoy.

When will music labels learn that ""louder"" is not better. It's especially pointless nowadays as most people are using some type of ReplayGain on their music players to play all music at the same volume. The result here is music that sounds completely flat and lifeless.

This is one of the worst casualties of the Loudness War that I've heard this year."
Five Stars <SEP> Wonderful old standard.
"A Great Singer! <SEP> I have loved Moyet since the beginning! Upstairs at Eric's was a favorite to many! But now, listening to her range and vocalizations, my question is "" why isn't she doing the Bond theme?"". Don't get me wrong, Adele is nice, but Moyet has a much fuller approach. I love that Metropolis has her signed! The Minutes is a very entertaining release.
The remix is nice and what you would expect. The disc is great on its own!"
Nope <SEP> Not worth the price: this digital download was free!
"Poor musical sound. <SEP> Very disappointed in the EMI remaster of this performance.  In my opinion, they did a good job at the noise reduction end, but failed to make the cd sound musical, thus enjoyable.  It just sounds flat.  If you want this 1949 performance, my advice is to obtain the  version on the Urania label."
Jo Stafford angelical voice <SEP> I just got the music score for this tune on a jazz mode but did not know the lyrics.  It's  a very beautiful romantic tune which I did not never heard.  That's the enchantment of music! All that on Jo Stafford's  angelical voice!
"Pioneering Purcell <SEP> Nearly fifty years old, these pioneering recordings still afford much pleasure as long as you respond the peculiarly plaintive timbre of Alfred Deller's countertenor at a time when few of that voice type were active. He is accompanied by some distinguished solo British singers of that era and the Deller Consort singing with true intonation and touching sincerity. The Stour Music Festival are rather distantly caught, providing a much tamer and more soothing backdrop to the singing than we are used to today with virtuoso period bands who have so much more presence but there is some lovely trumpet-playing in the ""Jubilate Deo"".

The disc is short measure at forty-four minutes but available at bargain prices; the two liturgical works are supplemented by the brief dramatic scena ""In Guilty Night"", atmospherically sung by a trio of singers of Deller as Saul, Honor Sheppard as the Witch of Endor and baritone Maurice Bevan as Samuel, and finally the Funeral Sentence ""Man that is Born of Woman"" sung in stately fashion by the same trio of singers and tenor Neil Jenkins.

This might not be how we hear Purcell performed today but it is still very musical and enjoyable."
"Stop Singing to Satan. <SEP> This type of music though it sounds good, is singing to the Devil. She is playing with fire and is looking to get burned. Although Satan is a defeated foe by the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary, he is very powerful and should be respected. When you sing Praises to God it Should be to thank Him for delivering you from the grip of the enemy. And not singing to him and boasting about what Christ Jesus did for you. Therefore I give this CD and the Artist one Negative feedback Star"
Five Stars <SEP> Great music soulful sound classic vibe w contemporary style
"This CD is currently on an infinite loop! <SEP> First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a newfound fan of Nina Rae. I absolutely love the music on her album ""Born to Love"". Each track is unique, yet serves as smooth and soulful to the listener's ears. I've listened to this album at home when relaxing -- and while on the road. Not to mention, I'm guilty of having this played on an infinite loop! I look forward to what future tunes Ms. Rae will come out with, as I find her music to be refreshing with a new feel for the genre of R&B!"
Five Stars <SEP> Beautiful.  Love it.  THank you.
"Yuck <SEP> I was not inpressed, it was hard to listen to and a major downer, there way a darkness to it that deeply disturbed me. No positive side to it. And the swearing added nothing to it. A waste of my time."
"Handel's Messiah: Going For Baroque In The Bay Area <SEP> George Frideric Handel's epic oratorio ""Messiah"" is truly one of the greatest single works of any kind in the history of Western music, both for the fact of Handel's own genius, and also because it deals with the birth, life, death, and eventual resurrection of Jesus Christ, a man whom more blood has been spilled over than any single figure that ever lived in the whole of human history.  But it is a work that has been interpreted over the centuries in an endless amount of ways, from period instrument performances and practices to modern chamber orchestras, symphony orchestras, and, most controversially of all, Sir Thomas Beecham's unbelievably oversized, almost Wagnerian 1959 Royal Philharmonic recording, which takes excess to ridiculous heights.  Indeed, it may have been Beecham's radical ""reinterpretation"" of this work that helped spawn the period instrument revolution itself, with purists literally fulminating over it.

To the end of period instrument performances of this epic work, there are dozens to choose from, ranging from Sir John Eliot Gardiner (with his English Baroque Soloists) to Trevor Pinnock (English Concert) and Christopher Hogwood (Academy of Ancient Music).  But if I had to choose a ""Messiah"" in terms of a form where speed and tempo markings sometimes seem painfully rushed, then I would choose a decidedly American period instrument ensemble, in this case English-born conductor Nicholas McGegan and his Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This orchestra is perhaps the best-known period-instrument orchestra here in the United States, having made incredible recordings of Baroque-era music, and venturing into the Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven Classical era in recent times.  Here, McGegan and his cadre of vocal soloists, including the late soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, and the University of California Berkeley Chamber Choir navigate through Handel's richly complex, portentous, and haunting tapestry in ways that don't get too bogged down in what I feel is the main fault of period instrument performances--that they are not only rushed, but also feel like the performers are rushing to finish to go off to a fire sale they momentarily forgot about.  The structure of immortal passages like ""He Shall Be Changed"", the ever-popular ""Hallelujah"", and the final ""Worthy Is The Lamb/Amen"" in this recording are equal to any other period-instrument performance.  I would also rank it with the modern symphonic interpretation made in 1987 by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Toronto Mendelssohn Choir under Sir Andrew Davis (for EMI), and the more modest forces on the 1976 recording by the English Chamber Orchestra and Choir under Raymond Leppard (on Erato)

""Messiah"" is well served by McGegan and his Bay Area forces on this Harmonia Mundi recording.  For those who want to hear this music in as close to the way it was actually performed back in 1729, you can do far worse than this.  I strongly recommend this recording, right up there with the other aforementioned ones."
"The perfect ""Messiah"" for Mr. Spock <SEP> I know half a dozen or so HIP readings of ""Messiah' and have attended one or two, but none as misguided as McGegan's totally bloodless one -- there is absolutely no emotional affect. You cannot tell if the text is describing fear, awe, exaltation, prophetic warning, or devotion before God. Every number is reduced to a quick jog-trot, the singers briskly going about their business.  I bought this set for the solos by Lorraine Hunt, the greatest Handel singer of our time before her premature death, but even she clamps down emotionally, clearly there's a musicological point being made, and McGegan is there to act as authenticity cop first and musician second.

His point seems misguided to begin with. The Baroque, in music, art, and architecture, exemplified expanded emotions, in the wake of the Counter-Reformation, which attracted worshipers back to Catholicism by florid emotional renditions of Christianity that ordinary people could relate to. This point is not in dispute, and when you add Handel's mastery of Italian opera, itself a highly emotional form, what excuse is there for sounding lobotomized? It's sad that McGegan decided so stubbornly to bleach out ""Messiah,"" because he has vocal soloists who are far above average, with real excellence that extends beyond Hunt to the bass and countertenor; only the somewhat gargly, warbly tenor lets down the team, but even he is good.  Just as outstanding is the choir from Berkeley, who can handle ""He shall purify"" at top speed with ease.

I don't believe that ""Messiah"" should go at top speed, but that's another matter. My negative reaction doesn't have to do with HIP practice but with this particular instance, which is bloodless and therefore out of the running.

P.S. 2014 - For anyone who wants only the lovely contributions of Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, they have been gathered in a 2-CD collection from Harmonia Mundi entitled Tribute."
A-MAZING! <SEP> AMAZING  Alubm! This guy has a fantastic voice! Glad to finally hear something that isn't run of the mill!  You won't regret buying this album!
Grace Filled Worship at Last <SEP> The lyrics to the songs are the only true grace filled music I've ever listened to. The accompanying music is quite enjoyable and draws me into worship. I recommend this to anyone interested in grace filled worship.
Four Stars <SEP> good yoga music
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!!
"Extremely disappointed! <SEP> I was extremely disappointed in this album. I bought it because I 'searched' for albums to listen to while I nap.. in other words - SLEEP.  This album came up and many of the songs were listed as being for sleep and restful.  Well.. After paying for and downloading the album, I ended up DELETING nearly ALL the songs because they either contained BIRDS chirping in the background (birds don't help you sleep - they wake you up!) or the sounds of those Tibetan bowl things, which.. when you are just drifting off, sound as though someone is blowing loudly  through some hollow tube or something. NOT RESTFUL! So, this album, for me, was a total waste of money."
Am Looking For The Rest Of His Albums If You Have Them ? <SEP> I Love This Guy & I Can't Stop ! Signing The Songs
Five Stars <SEP> Great
Don't bother <SEP> Just bad!
"Forget sleeping with this! <SEP> I purchased this through iTunes and it is the WORST recording I have ever heard.  The piano has a tinny sound to it -- not quite badly tuned, but sounds like it was a school spinet played in a high school gymnasim with  bad overtones.  Lousy production value.  So bad that I was not able to use it to relax.  I play piano and this recording just set my teeth on edge."
Five Stars <SEP> Classic performance. Peaceful and evocative.
One Star <SEP> Horrible
"Advertising nightmare, BUT 'cute' elevator tunes <SEP> The album cover grabbed my attention with the stunning ""OM"" symbol representation; albeit an opposite statement of the ancient meaning attached to the peaceful and virtuous dharmic cosmic context.
  Secondly, Pilates is a trademarked format of low-impact exercise and stretching that uses specific specialized equipment.  One of the reason's for it's invention was to aid in the rehabilitation process of professional dancers.
The point of the explanation is to note that the term or title ""Power Pilates"" is, at best, a misnomer.
  Finally, the titles of the individual cuts suggest very radical variations in themes.  Typically, people enjoy some variety in the tunes they listen to over the hour or so of a workout period.  Sadly, of the several 'pieces' I bought, there is very little noticeable variation beyond maybe the beat timing.  It sounds like computer generated 'elevator music'.
  Unfortunately, unlike iTunes, I don't think it's possible to sample music before buying.  I need to check on that.  Caution is highly recommended on this album.  There is a lot of excellent music out there made specifically for each application.  This, however, does not fit anything that I would expect of it; workout, meditation, easy listening - except maybe the elevator..."
"... I'm writing this review to improve Amazon's algorithm on recommended music on my account <SEP> Well I'm writing this review to improve Amazon's algorithm on recommended music on my account.

This is going to be brutal.
To be clear I'm a Rivethead/Prog Metal Fan.

Which means if it doesn't have a seven string guitar  thrash line supported by an atmospheric synth line. Don't bother.

Cover art really made me think ""Oh yeah this is going to be horrible,"" yup wasn't let down on that part at all...pardon me while I chase this down with some seven string thrash...."
"Out of tune piano? <SEP> I just heard this song on Google Play music and either the recording is bad or the piano is really out of tune. For the pitch-sensitive, or anyone who has been in music, this song is probably worth skipping, lest you find yourself unnerved. Not good for morning wake up music."
Five Stars <SEP> Great meditation music !
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! <SEP> DO NOT BUY THIS! THE SAMPLE IS MISLEADING AND ITS NOT THE SONG WE KNOW AND LOVE!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
Horrible sound quality <SEP> The sound on this is terrible and it sounds like it's skipping and at times is just noise. Find the song somewhere else
Five Stars <SEP> Great song.
"Eh <SEP> I downloaded this for free because I liked Cloud Aura, the song she did with Brooke Candy. This song isn't as catchy or even that great. I don't listen to Charlie, but she seems alright."
"Not the Right Album <SEP> Downloaded the album and it isn't what it says. I don't know what song it is, but definitely not Scott Kirppayne's ""You Are Still God"" - even went to YouTube to double check I remembered the song right. Irritating, especially since Amazon wouldn't let me listen to a sample before I made the purchase, so I had no way to know until after I paid. Rip off."
One Star <SEP> This material has a manufacturing defect. Please review the material! Thank you!
This material has a manufacturing defect and amazon buy twice ... <SEP> This material has a manufacturing defect and amazon buy twice and comes with the same problem. Please review the material!
OK <SEP> THOUGHT IT WAS A DIFFERENT SONG
"Love this song! <SEP> I've been a fan since they burst on the scene in 1997 and I must say the last couple albums they've released left me wanting more but if this song and the others I've heard say anything for their upcoming 6th studio album, ANTHEM, I'm really excited to hear the rest! And the fact that this mp3 comes with the video for the same price as the other download which only includes the song, I just had to get this one!"
Boring not what I was expecting <SEP> Boring not what I was expecting
Five Stars <SEP> Awessome
"Great album <SEP> Hopefully we can have more bands like this. I'm more into the heavier music, but I thought this was a great album."
"WATCH YOUR MUSIC BUYING VERY CLOSE,YOU MITE GET IDENTICAL MUSIC ON A VOL.WITH BIG.G <SEP> SORRY I BOUGHT THIS ONE CAUSE NOTHIN BUT A PARTY IS THE SAME SONG AS THIS ONE"
Great track <SEP> This is one of my favs to play at a party.  Better than most new music out now. Add it to your collection.

Five Stars <SEP> love it!
"Lead vocals still on track <SEP> I bought this song in a pinch to sing for church and after purchasing noticed that not only were the background voices on the track but also were the lead vocals.  It is obvious that they are still there.  Kind of misleading title, and frustrating."
This is a Beautiful work of a Catholic Indian Priest <SEP> This is a Beautiful work of a Catholic Indian Priest. The Cd Cover is very wrong. It has nothing to do with Hinduism.

Amazing! <SEP> This song has helped me get through some pretty hard times. I love it so much.
One Star <SEP> DID NOT MEAN TO BUY. PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON
Five Stars <SEP> It`s Wonderful
Fantastic <SEP> Love Enya music the best
great for stress <SEP> relaxing
Great relaxation music <SEP> I wanted to put on some music to do yoga to or to go to sleep to; this album works well for both.  I love enya and the sons on here are all good.
"Solid material from a great songwriter <SEP> Here's a great introductory album from this freshman songwriter Tony Sorrentino. Catchy melodies and superbly penned lyrics. The first half of the album contains songs with more electric guitar while the later half is more acoustic in nature. Brownstones, Veins, and It's All I Have are highlights.

A-"
"Your Mileage May Vary <SEP> I thought these guys were better back when they wore the makeup and had the big stage show.  I know
one has to change with the times, but you can't really see the one dude bleeding out of his mouth and breathing
fire while listening to an mp3.  Though, I like the fact that they have a girl in the band for the first time since
Vinnie Vincent."
funny heartbeat <SEP> I think it's awful I don't like it I won't recommend it to anyone I can't believe they made a song and got published.
"MP3 download is junk <SEP> Great album, but the quality of the MP3 download is terrible. The audio compression is so bad it sounds like the band is playing under water. Don't waste your time with the MP3, buy the CD."
"Love Docs Rule <SEP> If you like the Love Docs you can't go wrong with this cd.  Its old school Love Docs, I'll be getting the rest of them!"
Nice <SEP> Good item
"I'm Not Holding On to ""Holding On"" <SEP> The intro of the song reminds me of Sylvester, and I feel like the song will be a Hi-NRG dance track, and as a huge fan of that genre, I start to like the song.

Then high pitched distortion sounds join the party, and ruins the vibe. The vocals are almost indistinguishable, which I guess shouldn't matter, but it does to me. The melody is okay, somewhat lackluster. The song is 6:20, meaning it wants to be a club jam, but the flow just isn't right. The only thing that makes it a club jam are the claps and kicks.

It certainly doesn't fall into new age, or alternative. It's electronic.

The only place I could imagine hearing the song would be background music in a bad music store, or elevator music at a hipster conference.

Two Stars. Really, one and a half."
Two Stars <SEP> It was marginally OK.
"Superb musicality with great technical skill! <SEP> Michael Anthony Nigro's 3rd CD release is by far his best one yet.  The production is clean and the guitar has a big but very pretty sound.  Although the CD is titled, ""A Jounrey Through Latin America,"" some Spanish favorites also made it on this disc; pieces like Asturias and Capricho Arabe.  These pieces add to the flavor of the CD and help to show the influence of Spanish music on South American music.  Some of the best tracks on the CD are the Suite del Recuerdo by Jose Luis Merlin.  Nigro's mastery of this style of music is apparent on these pieces.  His interpretations are clear and dramatic using the entire dynamic range of the instrument.  This CD is well worth money."
Cant beat it. <SEP> I mean have you heard the song?....
no product for reveiw <SEP> i did not receive  my download for mp3/ mix up in download process and was unable to complete the process
"A Holiday Treat <SEP> Linda's music evokes wonderful memories of holidays past, while inspiring hopeful images for those yet to come.  Her music is equally at home with a romantic dinner or time spent around a fire with family and friends.  Linda's song choice is spot on.  She combines long-time favorites with current hits.  This year take a moment to treat yourself - or someone you care about - to this very special CD."
"This is positively the worst item I ever bought from Amazon <SEP> I was looking for the gospel song ""Ain't No Grave"" and this cd was offered at a decent price, but with no description or listenable sample at all.  It is, as best as I can describe it, hillbilly punk.  At any rate, I doubt it would sell on a bargain 25 cent table but I gave nearly $10 including shipping for it and will not trust this vendor again."
"Great song! <SEP> I've been to Butte and am writing a book about my time in Butte.  I saw Tom perform in Whitehouse Station, NJ recently and as soon as I heard it I knew I needed it for my collection and as more inspiration during my writing of my nonfiction book.  What a great song!"
"10 out of 10 <SEP> This entire album is a joy to listen to, glad to have discovered it!"
"Same problem as the last guy! <SEP> Just like the other review here, all I get is the first minute or so about Iras jewish friend. What a rip off! Amazon needs to fix this!"
Unable to download <SEP> I was unable to download this product.  The file continually stopped and reverted to the beginning.  I heard about  Ira Glass' Jewish friend about 15 times.
Wonderful <SEP> I love this CD ....he has a great voice and the words to his music are usually right on in my opinion!
"Priceless for Six bucks <SEP> If you listen to real passionate talented music, this is a must have. Been a fan of Smile Empty Soul for 10 years now...and this right here is no disappointment. I gave this album 5 stars because of  the effort and dedication that sean puts into his music. Its only 17 minutes long but definately 17 minutes of some really good acoustic work. I will always pay to listen to seans music just because he earned it and is one talented mofo. Again please buy this and spread the word for sean."
Perfectly perfect... <SEP> Perfectly perfect... great tunes by the best of talents.  This band creates magic from the word go...  Turn it up!
"George Winter host of The Lost and Found radio show. <SEP> The Lost and Found Show ""Go...and live your life now""! And while you're living you may want to check out the latest single from 'Dario and The Clear' titled ""Live Now"". Grabbing you from the opening chords, you just can't stop listening to this song! Dario is a songwriter who makes it look easy. With special guest Michael Bernier on Chapman Stick, this song is melodic yet has just enough rock and roll to make the combination of the two work perfectly! As is the case with all of Dario's songs, the lyrics tell a story that is worth hearing. You can buy this song on I-Tunes right now as well as other great music from Dario and The Clear. Go!!...Go and live your life now! And live it with Dario and The Clear. One of the greatest talents to come out of the Hudson Valley region of N.Y. State in a long time. You won't be disappointed!"
"Too small and looks cheap <SEP> Unisex size chart not accurate. Sneakers were too small and looks cheap, the leather looks like hard pleather. Returned item for refund with a $13.90 deduction from purchase price."
great album. <SEP> glad to have the new theme songs of wwe stars. love this album. some tracks are rereleases too. still great.
Fun Song! <SEP> I used this song as our recessional at my recent wedding!  Cute!
Geat song <SEP> Great bass-heavy beat and excellent conscious lyrics.  I already bought another song on the same beat. Chronixx reminds me of Sizzla when he first came out.
"Rap intro sucks <SEP> I love Jessie Ware and this song, but when was it declared that every female vocalist needs to improve their songs with a rap intro? Who needs that kind of distraction? Jessie's voice and the purity of her delivery is the heart and soul of this song. Nothing else is needed."
One Star <SEP> Good stuff.
Five Stars <SEP> I liked it.
"Not a good version to use as background music for functions. <SEP> I was looking for a version of the song that would be easy to sing at functions.
This version is not good for that. It's not adaptable to different voice levels and
just the style is not good for that."
"Are you feeling all right James? <SEP> James Cotton battled throat cancer, but it wasn't his time to go. On this lean and tasty tune with Keb' Mo' vocals, James shows how you can play a lot without riffing all over the place."
Four Stars <SEP> Good song.
"Ecclectic Sounds! <SEP> The eclectic sound of motorhead is by far blistering and titillating in its effervescence, and added to WWE's Triple H makes for a palatable and copacetic combination."
"One Star <SEP> this one never came across, couldn't find it on my computer"
Graduation march <SEP> Great song.

"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE <SEP> I love the piano music of James Oneil Miner and was so happy to find this country music CD.  This is one  of my favorites.  The package came in good condition and was exactly what the vendor claimed it to be.

awesome song! <SEP> i heard it and cought it rite away EDC chicago!!!!!! i cant wait to see them live. cause edc rock better than most fests. better than pitchfork fest/
"Excellent! <SEP> As always, kick _ss. oozing with emotion. Love these guys!"
One of the best Anime Soundtracks <SEP> Great Album !!!! All the songs stand out buy this album now
"Remarkable players, buy the original and slow it down using an app instead... <SEP> Better to use an app that slows down the tracks than buy this, it sounds lousy.  But the players are remarkable, so this is not about that.  It's just what happens when you cut the time digitally so severely, you get that weird distorted sound.  But Ron Carter, Kenny Barron and Ben Riley? Master's (innovators and contributors) of this idiom of the highest degree.  Buy the original and slow it down as needed instead IMHO."
Beautiful voice! <SEP> A captivating voice! Her accent and way of singing this song is so unique! This is the best version of this song I have ever heard!
"My bad <SEP> I'm just getting turn on to sinach love her music,but when order a package deal I expected it to come with 3 full cd's.."

Love it! <SEP> A true gospel singer with excellent vocals.
"Breezy, pleasing. <SEP> Laid back opening that belies the work that's going on harmonically here.  Once you've got this in your ear it's hard to escape it. Lots of pleasure listening to a samba earnestly delivered."
"Highly Recommended for Fans of 1970s Pop Songs <SEP> Singer/songwriter/guitarist Bruce Garnitz delivers a twelve-song tour-de-force, sliding into a variety of different 1970s-influenced styles on his latest record (and yes, he points out in the liner notes, he still calls it that even if you download these songs as MP3s).  But these are all grown-up songs, many of them looking back on the past and trying to recapture feelings from another era.  From combustible pop (""Rainbows In Gasoline""), flugelhorn-inflected melancholia(""My Mother's Voice"") psych-blues (""The Trouble is You""), straightforward radio pop (""Dear John""), Steely Danesque ballads (""Venice is Sinking""), proto-rap (""The Dead End""), to high-octane thumpers (""She Likes it When I Drive""), this is an album that will remind you of listening to a transistor radio under the covers late at night (most likely from a distant city on a signal that keeps fading in and out as the clouds move across the sky)."

Misleading <SEP> This is a cover and is NOT properly labeled as such. Wasted my money thinking it was the original.
"Personal preference - it's not the song i remember from the late 50s! <SEP> This appears to be rock music, not something you would expect to have heard on the radio in the late 50s when a song of this name was popular in Italy."
"A truly new sound... <SEP> Wayne Cobham and brotha.deep have forged together a sound that is tradition, avant-garde, groove and free-style, never heard before. It seems we are finally evolving this music called jazz!"
"Eclectic elecricity... <SEP> On this MP3, dedicated to raising money for children with congenital heart disease, you hear the lilting, yet funky ""A Smile"", the softly, soul-searching ""Touched"" and the gritty ""Forty Acres of Ghetto"", which is undoubtedly a statement to many lives in urban America. ""Not Included"" is a high energy rhythmic explosion with colorful, balancing overtones.
The music is DIFFERENT! These are marvelous selections of a true artist at work. Enjoy..."
"Super catchy <SEP> The rest of the album doesn't do it for me, but this track sticks in my head. Hopefully their next album is more like this!"
"I can't say enough good stuff about Dusty Tucker <SEP> I can't say enough good stuff about Dusty Tucker. They have quickly became my favorite band. You've never heard anything quite like this. Great guitar riffs, catchy drums, awesome vocals, every stong is a story you'll have to listen to several times to get just what is going on, but you'll be singing along to every word along the way. well worth the price of admission."
Not the movie soundtrack <SEP> I was looking for the song as it was sung in the first movie Madagascar and this isn't it. I found it from Album: Kids Dance Party Artist: The party cats
"Ridiculous <SEP> This song is heartless and absurd. She has the ""Nine Month Blues"" because she's pregnant. How utterly inconvenient. I wish there was a way to make sure that you don't get the ""Nine Month Blues"". Oh wait, there is. This song was commissioned by the National Abortion Committee in 1975. What else should you expect?"
Disappointed <SEP> I guess I need to read the information more carefully. I didn't know that these were not sung by the original artists
"Not the original artists... <SEP> They try to hide it, but this is most definitely not by the original artists.

If you are looking for the original versions, this is not the collection for you..."
dont buy <SEP> Didn't really like the style of salsa. It sounded like Cuban salsa and not puertorican but if you like any type  of salsa I guess it'll be worth dancing to.
"Skillet rocks the house!! <SEP> Been following this incredible band from the very beginning, they have just gotten better and better while staying true to the WOrd!!"
"was not my cup of tea <SEP> i tried it but it was not the sound for me, i do not know why i even got it or if it is a mistake"
beautiful <SEP> This a a great adaption of this song. Beautiful.
HORRIBLE!! <SEP> Not original recordings you have been warned! Some decent re-recordings but should be advertised as RE-RECORDINGS! Habs Bab Apple Bab
no-go <SEP> Not a fan. Seems lackluster and repetitive. Maybe good as high-energy background music.
repeatitious <SEP> Same music as in the Christmas album and patriotic album.
"One Star <SEP> It's like they took every wedding song ever, and slowed it down to a funeral dirge."
"Not All There <SEP> For a collection of must-have soprano masterpieces, I find it odd that 'Una Voce Poco Fa' would be left out. I know that technically that's for contraltos, but since it's so often sung by sopranos it's foolish to leave it out,

The sound quality is just fine.

The selection is often from rarely sung operas, not the common ones.

The singing... That's a horse of a different color. I'd invest in a good recording with sopranos from the 50s rather than buy this. It's not really a question of taste here-- in 'La Jeune Indoue' you can hear catches-- multiple catches-- in the high notes. At least these are not all sung by the same soprano.

These just aren't must-haves."
"One Star <SEP> Did not include one of the best- 'Bullet or Ballot"""
"so overall I was disappointed. <SEP> several of the speeches were repeated and added little to the Malcolm X ""In His Own Words"" which also had repetitious speeches. I thought on one of them I would get the Ballot or the Bullet and some of his other more defining speeches. The maker seemed to soft peddled around, seemingly trying not to step on anyone's toes; so overall I was disappointed."
"MISNOMER <SEP> One Hit Wonders??? Simon & Garfunkle, The Beatles, Diana Ross...Really WOWOWOWOW....News to me"
"Okay, but did not provide the speeches that ""MADE"" ... <SEP> Okay, but did not provide the speeches that ""MADE"" Marin Luther King, Martin Luther King. No letter from a Birmingham Jail and other more dynamic and powerful speeches.. That gave a stronger depiction of what was presented Negroes in that era and before."
Two Stars <SEP> not indexed. was purchased to help the blind
Don't buy this <SEP> There is really very little on this CD.  At least two whole tracks that are just relaxing noise (i.e. rain falling).
"This one sounds like it was taken off of a bad print of ... <SEP> This one sounds like it was taken off of a bad print of the film, maybe one that was sent to theaters for matinees. Or something. Damn, was I disappointed when I heard this. But they're not lying, it is the soundtrack."

"TENOUTTATEN <SEP> Best.

Also their stage shows are amazing - go see them."
"Salsa Dura <SEP> If you want to hear Salsa music of the old school this CD is for you!! Yolanda keep her voice and clave.  All the songs are heavy and keep you remind why they don't do this kind of work today very often. Salsero de la mata, esto es pa ti!!!!"
Great. <SEP> This is a women who can really sing and get down with the Guaguancos. I have always enjoy her voice even when she sang with Sonora Poncen'a  Very good cd.
Our Lord Preaching in Music <SEP> This is a great humorous telling of a profound christian principle.
Five Stars <SEP> If you like choral music you will love this collection.
"LIMP BIZKIT!!! <SEP> I don't care what anyone says, Limp Bizkit still has it!!! Lil Wayne is a terrible douche but this track is awesome enough to withstand his bull****. I can't wait for the new album!"
Poor remastering <SEP> I compared this remastered version to the '98 Eagle records original. The original is the better recording. The remastered version has a harsher sound. It was a waste of money.
Not sure <SEP> Losses
One Star <SEP> The song is amazing but it has yet to show up in my phone 
"So unexpected, <SEP> This song is hard to listen to for me @times. Not sure why but it strikes a cord in me. Intensifies the usually silent emotions that I feel for one family member..."
"It's a must have! <SEP> From beginning to end this album will have you wanting more!
It truly is a great way to start and the end the day with worshiping Jesus.
My favorite album to worship with!"
"GREAT ALBUM! <SEP> Love this Album! Created by truly gifted musicians and vocalists! Buy two - keep one and gift one! Go see Crossing Creative live at The Crossing Church - Elk River, Zimmerman and Big Lake, MN."
Love this song! <SEP> I love this song.  This is a great ballad for Ashanti to show her range on.  It shows her maturity
Very nice. <SEP> Very nice to the hears.  I love it. I have it on my Kindle and play it over and over again.
"Outstanding!!!!! <SEP> The tune is a monster ....can be listened to, danced to and performed by any good band, I recommed this tune to all salsa lovers"
Five Stars <SEP> WHERE ARE MORE SONGS. WHERE
"Keep your eyes on The Council! <SEP> I wrote the press release for these guys. Their record's insanely good, and they're genuinely nice, intelligent people. Album features George Clinton, Snoop, and tons of other talented people. Great beats, even better rhymes. It's def worth taking a look at."
"took a chance and I lost <SEP> I took a change on this one, didn't like it"
"GREAT!!! <SEP> I always love Lady Antebellum's songs, but this one in particular is amazing.  I will be using it for my first dance with my husband when we get married!!!"
Two Stars <SEP> ok
Two Stars <SEP> Too old...

"Casual fans be warned - this is Geoff Tate's Queensryche <SEP> Truth be, this is probably one of the better songs to come out from anything associated with Geoff Tate in some time. Song was written by Lukas Rossi (Rockstar Supernova fame), Geoff wrote the lyrics over the completed song, which from what I have read has been his approach since associating with Jason Slater, who is yet again back writing, recording and producing the record this single came from. This song I believe is the one that features the most members of his touring band, though not all - Robert Sarzo is not on this track, Kelly Gray only does the solo. So right there, calling this Queensryche when Craig Locicero is doing the guitar work really isn't true, not if you expect to go see them live and see the people who performed this song on the record do it live (enough on that, at the time of this review, they are on tour but not playing anything new from this album). Geoff of course sounds like Geoff, and he too is not terrible on this.

So why the 1 star? Because I listened to this song after listening to other Queensryche songs. I listened to it after listening to stuff from their classic era (prior to CDG leaving), and side by side I just comparing the music, I would never associate the two as being the same band. Now I know, the personnel are not the same, but take a listen to Lightning Strikes Again by Dokken...different bassist, different guitarist, yet that release sounds like Dokken. Their guitarist isn't copying George Lynch, but he is influenced, and he does his best to honor that sound in that latest release, and it was praised as a return to form. It is possible to have a band with different people, and have a consistent sound even though players change. Whitensnake is a good example of this.

So then I compared this to the Slater era...lesser known material from QR from OM2 and Amercian Soldier, figuring these albums minimally featured the core original band, as they were written by Slater and mainly played with session people and Mike Stone (who it was said was a salaried member of the band at the time, disputed whether he was really a full time member). Those songs, even though written by an outsider, you get the sense they were written with the main band in mind, so there still was a style there. OM2 wasn't a great album, but there are moments that at least invoked the QR sound, despite minimal core band involvement. It was enough to dupe me for years before I read court docs that stated that Ed and Mike contributed minimally, and that Scott wasn't even on that record. Dedicated to Chaos...while it had some moments, that entire release was such a left turn for the band that it really isn't fair to compare to. So I listened to stuff from OM2 and AS, stuff that to me at least sounded like Queensryche, and still 'Cold' musically sounds like it came from a different band.

I doubt this song was written within that 6 week time, if I had to guess, this song was already written and available, Geoff heard it, liked it, decided to use it, wrote his lyrics over it and this is what you have. So it is possible Lukas had no idea this would have wound up being a Geoff Tate/QR song. But it is possible that at the beginning of the 6 week period imposed to pull this all together, he wrote the song. At which point if this was the case, there is no original band, original band sound...no Mike, Scott, Whip...to have to write in the style of, so there was a freedom with this album that wasn't ever there before. So this further removes it from what sounds familiar.

So for the simple fact that at no point, does this song ever make me think this is Queensryche, and the fact that the band being sold to the public by Geoff as Queensryche (for the live shows) is minimally represented on the Frequency Unknown album (with this song having the highest concentration of people from the live band, but it also being the only time this happens)...I cannot in good faith recommend anything higher than 1 star on this song. The fans of Geoff will disagree with me, they are entitled to their opinion. I am not saying to not buy the song, because music is subjective, and you may very well like this track. But if you do not know what has been going on behind the scenes with Queensryche over the past year, a casual fan that sees this and thinks they put out a new song, know what you are buying first, and give this a listen. It may be a decent rock song, but it sounds nothing like the band you knew."
"Great for studying, doing taxes, etc... <SEP> My first Llewellen cd. Very nice, versatile."
OOOOOOO  Yessssss <SEP> Yes...A Great CD
One Star <SEP> Didn't realize I bought the edited version
"Not the End of Same Old Same Old <SEP> As Im one of them, I know how Australians sometimes like to rave about local product. You get it with this band, but I feel there needs to be a balance. Let's face it, there are 100s of bands like this one in countries the world over.

What this band plays falls under the pop-rock category, leaning more to pop than rock. In a saturated pop-rock market, you need to come out with fresh tweaks to the genre to make up for the clichs and tired-old chord changes--something really creative, such as unique guitar soloing. Unfortunately, there's none of that in this album, so you're left with a bunch of rather derivative tracks. Also, some of the songs are rehashed from an earlier album, and I find that album filling-up practice rather annoying.

There's always been something awkward about this band for me in terms of image. It was the effort to project a tough-guy image of themselves than what they were, even to the extent of proclaiming ""dangerous"" in an album name. It's kind of lame. DeMarchi got away with that vacant bored look when young, but in some more recent shots that pose just makes her look worn out and drained. Good thing she's got sunnies on in one of the main publicity shots. Then there was that video on Youtube showing backstage antics - one guy gives a finger to the camera and in another shot someone's scrawled ""Get F****d"" (fill in the blanks) on a piece of paper and they show that to the camera. Just so rock and roll high school. To me it reflects the mentality of the band and presumably what you can expect in terms of sophistication, intelligence and creativity.

Which brings me to the music. There's little difference in this album from what they were doing 20 years ago. Where's the progress in 20 odd years? Here's what one guy said about their first album: the ""band plows through a set of unchallenging material that, mainly, addresses relationships in a very simplistic and clichd manner ... long on bravado if a bit short on original ideas."" You could say the same about this album, only I think after a few of life's smack downs (which we all undergo, don't we) and the onset of parenthood, the bravado doesnt come through as much. To be fair, the song writing in some cases has moved beyond teen romance/angst drivel, but the music hasn't moved on. There's still a lack of sophistication and originality. DeMarchi's voice hasn't changed much either, which is not a selling point to my ear. I've always found she lacks range and just hasn't the projection power that would ideally suit some more anthemic tracks. There just seems to be something lacking.

Back in 1993, the guitar work on their second album was in my opinion an improvement over the first, and it suggested they were heading in an interesting direction, toward something more innovative and lasting. It's a pity they disbanded, but they could have picked up where they left off after reforming, not gone backwards to the safety of pop rock clichs. By doing that, they made this album forgettable, with only a couple of tracks I decided to listen to more than once. I kept being reminded of the 80s, and many tracks have a cookie cutter feel. There's the sense of where-have-I-heard-that-before and wait-that-sounds-like..., you know what I mean. None left me surprised or elated. I couldn't even last through ""Stitch"" regardless of any heartfelt underpinnings that inspired its composition. I tried to sit through an unplugged video of it on Youtube and gave up on it there as well. It's just plain boring. Maybe it improves after half way but I don't care to find out.

Sure, it's difficult in this day and age not to regurgitate, but enhancing or overcoming repetition is what sorts out the original from the lame. This is not to say some of this album's tracks won't have appeal for fans in a live setting. After all, this band is basically a pub band that seems content to be nothing more. If you like your rock soft or you're a fan from way back this album might appeal to you.

This album may not attract many new fans, so I hope DeMarchi and Co. were nice to people on their way up because, well, you know the saying. I think they peaked a long time ago. Unless their next release is spectacular, I'll be giving it a miss. There are too many sophisticated and exciting bands out there that are more deserving of attention."
"So Good - Updated <SEP> I have been a Baby Animals fan since first hearing Painless all those years ago. The other day I did a web search to see what they were doing these days and discovered they had a new album. So I ordered a digital copy.
I absolutely love it.
Suze may just be my favorite female lead singer ever. And her voice is still so strong.
Do yourself a favor and get this album. My experience with it has been very similar to their debut album - the more I have listened to it, the more I like it. I bet you will, too.

UPDATE - I just wanted to say that after 2 years I am still blown away by this album. Every song is great. My favorite is probably ""Things That Make You Stay"" and every other song is a close second."
"Got it for my collection, and that's all <SEP> Another rare miss for the ERBoH team. On the plus side, the music and rap lyrics are good. My complaint is using a virtual unknown like Skrillex. In my opinion, these raps should have more meaningful/popular/mainstream/historic/fictional characters. I had to Google who the heck this guy was... and was not impressed by his talents. He did not deserve to be paired up against anyone in an ERBoH. Mozart ftw.

As my subject line said, I got it mainly for the collection's sake. I also wanted to give my comment, hoping that the artists would realize their folly and not repeat if they read them."
"Great Album! <SEP> Gives new life to the world of EDM, Dubstep Music & House Music. I love it because you can tell Grouchy Ron has his own style and isn't a carbon copy of other EDM artist. Great buy!"
Laughably bad they sound like really bad imitation of the beach ... <SEP> Laughably bad they sound like really bad imitation of the beach boys. Hopefully this band quits making music and give up.
Great message. <SEP> I used this song in my confirmation class.  The youth absolutely loved it.  This song has a wonderful messageabout our human sinfulness and our need of a Savior who will forgiveness.
Great Tune! <SEP> I don't know why amazon makes you write this to review the song. It's a good song. I liked it. Duh Amazon!
"Love This Song... <SEP> Would have preferred original from ""For All We Shared"" but Amazon doesn't offer. This was as close to that original, albeit, a different version."
Five Stars <SEP> Great song. Jessica Dawn rocks!
"LOVED IT! <SEP> just relax and listen......this is really....one of my want to own it, songs of praise and worship, Mr Parker sings
this so inspiringly!"
"Great Gospel <SEP> The song was very beautiful, and very easy to listen too, great start of your day, be still and know"
"Not original songs <SEP> These are covers of the listed songs, not performed by the original artists. All songs are performed by the ""Countdown Singers."""
"Disappointing. <SEP> I didn't understand this one. It almost sounded like a pack of B-sides, it didn't feel like it had much effort put in, there's really only a couple songs on here that are OK and the rest are forgettable. He changed his singing style, his voice sounds high-pitched and purposefully out-of-tune and out-of-key a lot of the times and it adds nothing to the poorly conceived songs that are, really, not that memorable - especially when compared to their first 2 albums which were anthemic, powerful and punchy. Killer Sounds is supposedly to be some sort of transitional thing, I have to believe, an experimental thing, but doesn't quite work as well as lets say, The Jam's ""Sound Effects"" which worked brilliantly at a time when Paul Weller started to push for a transition with him.
The techno-house-dance remixes add nothing to this album. For the price, they barely make the album worth it."
One Star <SEP> this remix contains 0% of the original song. this is some club loop.
"do not waste your money! <SEP> I literally want my dollar back this is not what I thought I was purchasing, super pissed! But I guess I learned a lesson."
Two Stars <SEP> It is okay
"Ever been sick of it? <SEP> This my favorite song off the CD says everything I feel when I'm having a bad day. Singing it from the top of my lungs is pure therapy for me. I don't know about anyone else, but this song and 'Not gonna die' you can't help but scream and shout with theses songs."
One Star <SEP> Not one of their best.
Skillet .. need say no more! <SEP> Skillet is great. download was fast. No problems. great band!! Sadly they were here a few days ago and I was sick. one day!
"What happened to Skillet?????? <SEP> Wow, is this a step in the other direction or what? What's with the chanting and long song endings that even upset my 12 year old? This is not like any of their last five releases at all. Very disappointed."
"Big fan of Skillet, good song <SEP> First to be frank, the first time I heard the song I wouldn't have given it 5 stars, more like 3. I would have liked to hear Jen's voice in a few parts rather than John's. However now it's one of the first songs I listen to at the gym and it really gets the blood flowing!"
Score!!!! <SEP> I love this song!  I  especially like to hear it at the Blackhawks games....everytime we get a goal!!!!  Hope to hear this song a lot in the near future!!!
Movie <SEP> Great
"Not what you expect -- all the good stuff is missing. <SEP> If you expect this to be the complete score to ""2001-A Space Odyssey,"" you will be greatly disappointed, as was I. It is basically the musical ""sound effects"" for the screen action -- no ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" no Karl Heinz Stockhausen, no ""Blue Danube.""

I'm very disappointed."
"Two Stars <SEP> For some reason, I was anticipating only the theme. My fault. Thanks"
Five Stars <SEP> crazy about this song
"More great Ennio <SEP> Simply amazing. This is the song playing in ""For a Few Dollars More"" when the bad guy leader goes in and kill the wife and kid, then the man. Brutal scene, brutal song."

Five Stars <SEP> Love it
"played on a cheap keyboard <SEP> The songs are well chosen and well played, but they are not being played on a real piano.  Somebody's playing them on a digital keyboard.  When you put this music on quality equipment, this is going to become immediately obvious:  it's a tinny, cheap sound."
I was disapointed. I was looking for something to ... <SEP> I was disapointed. I was looking for something to just put on and relax with but they were Very lengthy exercises and really requires 100% commitment. I already do a lot of different self-help type work and this one just goes in the corner with hundreds of books and tapes. One of these days I'll check it out again when I'm more prepared to spend a lot more time with it to see if it really works and then I'll post an update. For now its hard to say if it will really work or not. I was much more interested in Stewart's interviews about it - he does seem knowledgeable
Piracy <SEP> If this true why is Amazon selling it? They need to do a better screening job of what they sell here. Thanks for the info. I'll keep my eyes open.
"Pirated... do not download! <SEP> I have talked to one of the members of Strange Advance at the Facebook fan club page. He knew nothing about the August MP3 releases, so he did a little bit of asking around. Wouldn't you know it? These MP3 releases did not come from the record company, but are pirated releases. Those of us who bought the music thinking we were supporting SA are very unhappy knowing that it is not our band who is getting the profits.

Absolutely nothing wrong with the music, of course... but everything wrong with the pirating."
The Worst Digital Rendering I Have Ever Heard! DO NOT PURCHASE!!! <SEP> This is a crime! The digital rendering of the music is absolutely horrible. I was really excited to see this long out-of-print album finally available for digital download - what a disappointment! This is total CRAP!!! Amazon - you should reimburse anyone who purchased this pathetic digital rip-off. WARNING - DO NOT PURCHASE or risk wasting your money like I wasted mine.
"Show Us Your Glory <SEP> I enjoy listening to soft soothing music.  I first heard this track about three months ago. I had no idea
who the artist was but remembered four words ""Show Us Your Glory"". I knew that it had to
be a part of my collection so I searched on Amazon and there it was. I am delighted
that I made this choice. It deserves non stop listening."
"Distorted <SEP> This is of value to me, since it was Remixed to extend, but whoever mixed it distorted in spots, maybe from bass guitar or bass drum, you hear ""popping"" throughout. Sad."

This is stealing! <SEP> Holiday Classic Records is using this recording without authorization from Playhouse Records who owns the copyright. They are charging 99 cents for something they don't own!
"Country Funky, Jesus-freaky from 1970 <SEP> The HJB was part of the Jesus Freak scene in Kansas City in the late '60's and early '70's, bringing with them some real talent and a bit of hipness from their pre-Jesus days. Heavily influenced by the country rock of such bands as the Byrds and Flying Burrito Brothers, they combine some genuine musical talent with heart-felt, if a bit Fundamentalist lyrics. The wry sense of humor in some of their tunes make it enjoyable to listen to again after almost 40 years, with a hint of The Grateful Dead. They were a lot of fun to watch and still fun to listen to; a cool graft of Christian country rock from 1970, before the Jesus freaks mainstreamed into right wing Republicans."

"Five Stars <SEP> I changed my review....
I am BAFFLED! something keeps removing ONLY this album from my music library.
No, I'm not imagining it. It is truly frustrating. Glad I kept the ZIP file of it, because I won't be able to download it again.
I have to keep replacing it every few days.... WTH is going on Amazon?"
Five Stars <SEP> Great collaboration
Two Stars <SEP> Most of this is cool jazz and NOT New Age.
"Soothing, spa-like music to sleep or soak in a bubble bath too. <SEP> I love this so much, I can't sleep without it. I have a constant ringing in my ears and this drowns out the ringing and replaces it with soothing, spa-like, music."
"Not worth the electrons that sacrificed themselves for this noise <SEP> If someone likes and will pay to listen to ambient noise, not only are there are an infinite number of better choices but they are also way too easily entertained.  And if anyone really thinks these sounds will transport them to NYC:  Please.  No one can tell the difference between NYC street sounds or Philly, PA street sounds, or even Tulsa, OK street sounds - it's just a bunch of noise."
"Not a fan of the end result, but appreciate the concept. <SEP> I appreciate seeing the beauty in the noises of the city. I don't need a whole album dedicated to them."
"""September Gen"" isn't what you think it is. <SEP> There isn't even one ""song"" here - it's a mistake.

I wanted to hear more of ""September Gen"", and I tracked it down.

The track ""September Gen"" is actually ""It's Working"" by MGMT, on their Congratulations album. The runtime is different since the track just repeats some of itself at the end.

Brooklyn Soundscraper's ""September Gen"" seems to be about 12 minutes of more ambient sounds, if other online music store samples are to be  trusted."
"Doesn't work for me....where's the music? <SEP> From what I can tell from the samples, there's only one song on this sampler and the rest sounds like some kind of recording from a NYC subway. I liked the one song, but I don't really care to listen to subway sounds from New York, or any other place for that matter....I don't know where this is trying to go, but the 30 second blips they give you to preview don't impress or inspire...subway noise is just that....noise."
"They failed to make their case <SEP> Whoever made this entry affected my impression before I even started listening. Honestly, misspelling the word ""Gritty"" in the title of the entry is unforgivable.
But the choice of their first sample sunk their boat for me. A 28-second track made up of some kind of shaking percussion instrument by itself. Sorry, no interest in listening further."
Five Stars <SEP> Loved the music
Two Stars <SEP> Basically purchased this for one song. Still not sure if it was worth it
"Eh <SEP> Good musicians... bad songs.

There are too many highly overrated reviews here.

The cover of the album is the best thing about this."
This is a good album but the 2 stars is for the recording ... <SEP> This is a good album but the 2 stars is for the recording is done on one channel. You can't hear the clarinet part or the rest just mostly the brass. Whoever did this remastering messed it up. Good thing I have all the albums. Like I said it is a good album but 2 stars for the bad remastering of it
2 thumps up <SEP> just perfect. an amazing remix. way better than original beat wise. kento's vocals are great on both.
One Star <SEP> None of their greatest hits...
"No One Better... <SEP> If you're lucky enough to get Jonatan Bckelie (formerly recording as Ernesto) of Sweden to perform on one of your tracks, you have a great opportunity to create something special, and this tune by Jimpster does not disappoint. Get ready to dance your butt off.., and feel good doing it !!"
"Washed up. He think he Tupac <SEP> Washed up. He think he Tupac. Sex tape was years ago, get over it. This dude is full of himself. Ray-J is supposed to be R&B not hip-hop. He is grasping at straws trying to stay relevant. This song is wack as hell. What was the point? With this single Ray-J try's to hard to come off like Tupacs I hit'em up and instead comes off like a classless, tasteless and no talent random R&B guy. This song sucks. Ray-J sucks. If it was not for lame reality tv shows keeping this guy around and the internet allowing to still put out music he would be robbing 7-11's now.."
"beta lyrics <SEP> Tries to sound Alpha with these lyrics, but it come across as super chump Beta!  Trying a little toooo hard there.  Not a good song anyways.  WEAK"
Time to move on and get some help dude! <SEP> This song right here is a perfect example of when a past relationship messes with your head and you cannot move on. How many years ago has Ray J stopped dating Kim Kardashian & Lil Kim??? Bottom Line is the beat and hook may be catchy but still the song is still corny. Nobody cares if you hit it first or last but people do care enough on why you haven't moved on.
"Fame whore trying to use a fame whore <SEP> Ray-J just wants a high-five for hitting that. Maybe the Manti Te'o hoaxer or some other low-life can give it to him. Seriously, this is the state of pop culture. Deluded narcissists making music and reality TV. I'm surprised the cover art isn't just a selfie."
If you support crap like this... <SEP> YOU are a part of the problem and are what is wrong with music today.  Ray J is pathetic for this junk.
"Haha <SEP> Ray J looking to sell records using Kim. It's a desperate attempt to become relevant.  Funny, but obviously very desperate."
"Heavy beat, excellent hook! <SEP> Old styles rhythms and new age techniques combine for a classic blues tune sung in 21st century style.  You can almost feel the rain falling on you.  What rain, you ask?  A song this blue needs rain to make it true!"
"EVIL, PURE EVIL <SEP> Now this might be biasesd because I know Ross the bassist/singer, but this cd is a benchmark release.  Many twists and turns but all together a sick evil cd. HAIL"
Five Stars <SEP> How do you buy the physical CD??
Great EP Album <SEP> I love this album. I listened to it over and over again when I first got it. Her voice is cool!
Didn't get what I ordered. <SEP> This sight says this is a book. It is not. This is a regular c.d. did not appreciate buying something that is not what it is said to be. You need to correct this.
New Orleans Rock n' Roll at it's best! <SEP> A great little collection of the sound from New Orleans in the 50's. Great to hear Earl Palmer keeping the groove.
What? $600.00 CD? <SEP> Ya gotta be kidding.  $600.00?  This is a great album but not for this kind of money.  Lelsewhere on amazon for the same item for under $20.00.  Don't get ripped off.
"Good old, live concert performances <SEP> This release on Memories Reverence (of Milan, Italy) I must rate a bit higher than some of their other live Munch concert releases -- it is very good and interesting.  All these were done live with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

CD 1 -- Mozart: Symphony No. 35, concert of 10 Oct. 1958; Symphony No. 40, 11 June 1959.  Beethoven, Symphony No. 7, 8 Oct. 1960.  Munch's Mozart was standard for the time, large orchestra, no repeats, etc., but still done well and fairly enjoyable -- also see here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Symphony-No-31-35-36-39-40-41-Requiem-Charles-Munch-by-Charles-Munch/dp/B01G4CWQHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart:Symphony No. 31 & 35 & 36 & 39 & 40 & 41 Requiem Charles Munch by Charles Munch</a>&nbsp;(the No. 40 is the same on both, the No. 35 is from a completely different series).

Munch's only commercial recording of this was the first he made with the BSO back in late 1949.

CD 2 -- Mahler, Symphony No. 10 Adagio only., concert of 5 Dec. 1959.  Brahms, Symphony No. 1, 7 Nov. 1961.  Munch doing Mahler is certainly a rare item, the only other works by this composer I am aware of being the 2 song-cycles he conducted for RCA&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahler-Lieder-eines-fahrenden-Gesellen-Kindertotenlieder/dp/B01NBJJOVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahler: Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen & Kindertotenlieder</a>&nbsp;.  The performance of the Adagio here is very moving and lovely, really captures the spirit.  The Brahms No. 1 was a work Munch did well, though I do not really care that much for the RCA recording he made of it.  I do love, however, the version from the Orchestre de Paris, which is my favorite of any&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brahms-Symphony-No-1/dp/B00JBJWH7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brahms: Symphony No. 1</a>&nbsp;.  This live one is also excellent, has acceptable sound, and is a joy to listen to -- really good!"
Aeterno <SEP> my daughter and I liked this song a lot. I would buy music from this group in the future. Erin
It's Not What It Used To Be <SEP> This is not the Jossie Esteban we all remember anymore. He is singing Christian music and most of the songs on this album are ballads. He does not have the voice to sing slow music. He does include a few merengue songs on this album but they don't have the spice and the characteristics of Jossie Esteban. I'm all for people pursuing religion and their beliefs but that doesn't mean you have to change the music that has made you a legend.
"Why the drums? <SEP> Just cello would have been much better.  Or even one single cello solo.  Bongo drums aren't helping whatsoever.  Not to my tastes, thanks."
"It must be current classic rock <SEP> If you put Led Zepplin, The Rolling Stones and Van Halen or Montrose in the martini shaker in 2015...this is what you get."
"Fun, energetic song! <SEP> I have been loving listening to this song!!  Can't wait for the EP to come out!  Alyssa's voice is amazing!  So fun to listen to!!!"
wrong song <SEP> Wish there was a way that I could get a refund or maybe even download another song of my choice to compensate for this accidental purchase... same title but very different song. I DID PURCHASE THE CORRECT song after the wrong song was download ed...
"If He Did It Before.... Same God <SEP> Kevin to be only 18 speaking about God is a powerful thing. You must read the word more to educate people on certain topics. and of course your actions are a teaching tool as well as you gave God praise in your song. i pray you learn the different ways of teaching and ministering so your ministry is complete so you can raise up others.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Need-You-Now-How-Many-Times-feat-Tony-Vicks-Raiysa-Muhammad/dp/B00C9VKQS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Need You Now (How Many Times) [feat.

Amen"
"Good writing, good solos! <SEP> I discovered Florian Ross as an arranger of my favorite track on Kurt Elling's most recent CD. ""Ties & Loose Ends"" is a collection of original compositions and at least one arrangement that he did with his own big band. Features stellar writing, in the vein of later Bob Brookmeyer but with more youthful vigor. Some tracks have driving rock & roll rhythms, almost all of them feature expansive, florid counterpoint, many of them incorporate classical-sounding moments. A good jazz composer! And best of all - unlike many big band recordings featuring relative unknowns, all the soloists on this record sound fantastic. A highlight is the bass solo on the second track, which interrupts some pristine imitative horn writing with perfectly placed harmonics. A worthwhile addition to your modern jazz collection!"
Disappointed <SEP> I thought I was getting the Charlie's Daniel Band version of Devil Went Down to Georgia and it wasn't the version I thought I was buying.  I am disappointed.  The song doesn't give the same vibe as it was sung by the original artist.
One Star <SEP> This is very short and doesnt give much info
HHHOOOTTTT <SEP> This song is amazing!!!! Very Powerful message with a powerful beat.  I highly recommend to buy this song right now
NOT HAPPY <SEP> I purchased this and now I have no way to listen to it
"Why so retro? Here's why... <SEP> With Jana's soulful rendition of Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come."" The funk driven, melodic rhythms with supportive lyrics in (I will be your) ""Solid Ground..."" Jana helped me breathe again. But why does she sing, ""born by the river in a little 'tent?..'"""
"Illogic and Blockhead = DOPE! <SEP> This collaboration is super dope sauce. I'm definitely going to get this album as soon as possible. Illogic has dope rhymes with intricate meanings behind them, and Blockhead has sick ass jazzy beats that hip hop heads love."
"Not what you think <SEP> This is the instrumental version, but it was not advertised as such."
"Five Stars <SEP> Somber yet beautiful, first heard during the funeral procession out of Westminster, September 1997."
"Leicester Bangs Review (2013): <SEP> John Velsor - Keyword Almost (Independent)
The list of John Velsor's influences is both long and wide-ranging, from punk, indie and folk to Debussy and the Velvet Underground. His new album ""Keyword Almost"" reflects his broad tastes, and he incorporates them into his sound, but without compromising his own musical identity. Indeed, there's an easy melodic flow to be found throughout the album, which suggests that, although Velsor absorbs various genres as a fan, he's single-minded when it comes to his own output, with his songs providing the basis of his style.

He defines his music as folk-rock, and that's about right, though it's a particularly energetic version. In his home city of New York, Velsor's a regular live attraction, both solo and with his band, and most of them appear on the album. It begins with one of his best songs ""It Just Stopped Raining"". Its `60s feel and solid hooks bring to mind both original Brit-invasion artists like The Hollies, but also `70s retro power popsters such as Greg Kihn and The Rubinoos. There's a hard, rocking edge to a few of his songs, especially ""Time to Go"", its chopping rhythm contrasting nicely with Velsor's vocal, and a dirty, brilliant guitar solo also features."
Two Stars <SEP> Music no words
beneath your beautiful <SEP> The cover on this is horrible. I wish I could remove it somehow on my kindle. I got because I wasn't sure which version was the best. But now I know... not this one!
"Great song <SEP> Heard on NPR, and had to google search for it based on the refrain, which is all I could remember. Did not know that Steve Martin played banjo either! Awesome song, and based on a true story. [...]"
Best break up song ever! <SEP> This song is so beautiful and grounded (at least for brave people) that it makes almost worth it to reconcile and break up again to keep it relevant!
Incredibly good mix of new and old school <SEP> I had never heard of Daryl Williams until I came across a free sample of I Will Fear No Evil.  Coolest song ever!  I listened to the free samples of every song on the CD and there was not one I didn't like. I have a very fast paced and stressful job and this is my go to CD on my way to and from work. He's really got something to be proud of here and I will be looking forward to what he puts out next......outstanding!
"Love Banjos! <SEP> Was watching t.v. one morning and Steve Martin was on with his banjo, so I waited for the comercial to end so I could hear all about this new song.
 Eddie Brical(?) I haven't heard her in years. She has a very interesting voice, and paired with Steve Martin's band the two were a perfect blend!"
big fan <SEP> steve martin is genius and the pairing with eddie is amazing.  i would say this is blue grass with a haunting quality because of her wonder ful voice.
One Star <SEP> this is the worst rock album in history. i've heard thousands of albums and this is the worst.
Sassy and fun <SEP> One of the funnest songs I've gotten this year! Sassy with great vocals from Caro Emerald.
Bachman Serves Up Melodic Rock Treasure <SEP> Randy Bachman has put together ten near perfect songs highlighted by Symphony and Do You Miss Me  Darling with Brian Wilson. Reminded me of Brave Belt. The moody Everything Is Grey kicks things off. Another highlight is Somewhere Somehow. Frank Ludwig from Trooper  contributes songs and keyboards. A gem.
"One Star <SEP> I never got it, it just took my money"
"A disappointment <SEP> This is going to be the very first time for me when I say that I do not like the new Conjure One song. I have been a fan of Conjure One since the first album. While the following albums after the classic self-titled has been anything but flawless, at least they each had memorable singles. The newest Conjure One song ""Under the Gun"" is anything but memorable. There is no melody and I'll be honest, Leigh Nash isn't that good of a singer. Her shrill vocals just rubs me the wrong way six ways to Sunday. Personally I think Rhys Fulber should stop having Leigh sing on his albums. Seriously. Stop. Her voice is irritating and ruins the song for me. Personally Rhys should try using Nadina whose debut album In The Now has a wonderful voice and would be perfect for his music since her music is a mix of Middle Eastern and modern electronica.  That or Alison Goldfrapp or even Poe. I really did want to like ""Under the Gun"" but no matter how many times I listened to it, I kept cringing with every listen. I hope this isn't what to expect on the new album because if it is, I will most certainly pass on it."
I thought it was the version heard on the video ... <SEP> I thought it was the version heard on the video but it wasn't my fault I didn't realize I could have previewed it before I paid for it
"Great song. <SEP> Very similar sound to early ELO.
Great song."
Great purchase. <SEP> Best cover of this song I've ever heard. Totally worth the purchase. Happy this managed to get out before the show was cancelled.
Five Stars <SEP> Love their voices together
"A good cover, but does not replace the original <SEP> I love the pianist in this version, which is why I bought it. Menzel and Michele nail the belting. They both have fantastic voices, and blend beautifully. The only thing I actually have against this cover is that it is so cheery. In and of itself, it's great, but it sort of misses the possessive undercurrent of the lyrics. The original, by Emeli Sande, is still upbeat, but it's a more nuanced sly performance. In the end, I think it's worth the money to have both tracks."
"Cute song <SEP> I have liked this song for months now and finally bought it. Very catchy, upbeat, positive, and I can work out to it! These guys have good voices too."
"not a big fan of glee anymore.. <SEP> Great song to inspire people &help them through their day by listening to  MY SHOW ON KGLP.ORG  Don't worry, be happy! show."
Nice happy up tune... <SEP> And dance floor winner. At a recent wedding in Cartagena this came on and everyone was up and dancing.
"True Hip hop <SEP> This is one of my favorites songs from back in the day "" Classic "" true hip hop at it's best."
Excellent! <SEP> This is a great way for everyone to learn the Sh'himo Compline songs.  I can't wait until the audio for the rest of the hours is posted!
Two Stars <SEP> Thought it was different CD. I am not into this music.
Whoever edited this album is an imbecile worthy only of Turandot's heartless wrath!!! <SEP> Why in God's holy name would anyone split this up into 40 tracks is beyond me!? Listening to this really is like listening to Chinese...choppy. I suggest trying to find an earlier released version that has more continuity. I can't even listen to this because it's like a skipping CD. Ridiculous!!!
I love Coyote Cleanup <SEP> I love Coyote Cleanup. Super chill lux and the guy who makes it is super cool. I messaged him once and he was very friendly. I hope they keep it up!
Not what I was expecting <SEP> I was looking for something a little more appropriate for teenagers/adolescents and the tension of squeezing and releasing tension in the muscles. At some points this got a little weird and others said the voice was creepy
"Were am amerocam bamd. Rob Zombie <SEP> I bought for my son, I think the music is for kids, not me.  Just writing, not interested in this kind of music"
cole world <SEP> Great song from the start of the beat to the drop from a great artist in j-cole all out great album born sinner
love it <SEP> Love it
This album is great. This is one of my favorite albums by ... <SEP> This album is great . This is one of my favorite albums by Rob Zombie.
Wow! <SEP> How did Rob Zombie take what was a mediocre song to begin with and suck everything out of it that was worth while?
Five Stars <SEP> BEAUTIFUL song and Really makes my Subwoofers happy!!
"Two Stars <SEP> disappointed that one of my favorite songs wasn't on the album.  ""Love Runs Out"".  Thought it would be."
"Five Stars <SEP> This is sung beautifully, a really good praise song."
"Hate this one <SEP> Wrong version, not the same when he put our years ago, Hate this one!
Wishes, why was it changed ?????"
What versiom is this? <SEP> What version of this Jon Butcher song is this?!?!?  The old folks version minus all the good stuff!?!?!?  You don't have the hit version I used to love. Get rid of this one.
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite things. <3
"Don't buy if you want original <SEP> NOT ORIGINAL MUSIC, more or less crappy covers. Luckily I only purchased one song so I didn't waste too much money."
"Karaoke Versions of our Favorite songs!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!! 1/5 Stars is Too many!!! Ggrrrrr... <SEP> Bastards stole from my wallet!!! These are Sad and BAD attempts at Karaoke junkys singing OUR favorite songs!! Heck, I can outsing most if ot ALL these yahoos on this album, HAD I know these where NOT original artists copys, I would NOT have waisted my hard hard earned $!!! This is the 2nd Time Amazon has allowed Scum Bags to steal $$ from me.. I'm a very good amazon custome and I feel taken advantage of."
Covers? <SEP> I bought this album thinking it was a compilation. I had no idea it was a compilation of covers. I am not very happy.
"Do NOT Buy!!! <SEP> It did not say anywhere on this page that these were not the original artists. (As of this review, it is still not posted on the site.) Do not waste your money on this album. You will be disappointed!"
"VERY DISAPPOINTED! <SEP> I understand these are not the original artists (which I failed to read the fine print, my fault), however the replacement singers aren't even close!!  Big waste of money and I will never buy another album here."
Wilson Phillips <SEP> Love this album! All of the songs are great! I'm a big fan of Christmas music and this is one of my favs!
Love These Guys <SEP> The first track on this album made my roommate lock his door once when I was playing it late at night.
Yes! <SEP> Love these boys. Could listen to them 24/7.
the quieter the better.! <SEP> Just what it's supposed to be.  I use it to fall asleep.  I suppose it could be used as a meditation tool; but a meditation mantra should be repeated inside your head ... the quieter the better.!!!
Good Country <SEP> I really like this new group and their song is respectful and will appeal to both fans of country and gospel. I liked it and wiould like to get the CD.
Irish Ballads <SEP> This album should be published in todays computer format.  This is Irish music from the late 60's and should be released so we don't loose a the voices of a time passed.
"Tim Steele <SEP> Great CD.

Great choices of Jay's acoustic collection, great lyrics, great vocals, great guitar, and nice work on the production Ruppster.

Budd Lake's Finest - Jason Byrnes

you are missed...

-mac"
"Amazing <SEP> Jason is an amazing singer and songwriter who was truly taken too soon.

This album is amazing, I just wish I could get the live version from Centenary.

Soulful, eerily prophetic, just amazing amazing music.  Some of my favorite songs of all time."
"A good stumble <SEP> While I am not into modern electronic/dance music, this one struck a chord.  It was almost like listening to the likes of Pet Shop Boys and like from 1980s."
"Have loved this song since it came out <SEP> Have loved this song since it came out.  They are talented musicians to say the least.  We have depended on the sound they produce to flavor our programming on WDVX for the past 17 years.

-Amy Campbell of ""The Tennessee Farm Table Radio Show"" on East Tennessee's Own, 89.9 FM WDVX.com"
Five Stars <SEP> Leonard Cohen -- says it all.
"Music From Ben Hur in the Order of the Film Itself <SEP> This CD is a compilation of two LPs ""Music From Ben Hur"" and ""More Music From Ben Hur"", originally released on MGM Records. What makes this CD worthwhile is that all of the tracks from both previous releases are presented in the same order as the film itself, which makes for a much improved listening experience. Although not as complete as the 2 CD release from Rhino Records, or the 5 CD set from Film Score Monthly, this CD is adequate for most listeners. The sound is excellent, as is the playing of the orchestra."
Sorry <SEP> I can't get into it.  (In other words:  I don't like it.)
Five Stars <SEP> very nice!!!!
Gerald is missed <SEP> Love the sound of Gerald music. Needed this in my collection. was the one song not on any of the CD's I have.
"Gerald + Eddie Levert = Great music <SEP> Love Gerald and Eddie Levert together. Gerald is gone to soon, There was much more music for the both of them together."
Two Stars <SEP> ok not good
Two Stars <SEP> not the original cut that i wanted switch on me during transaction
"Embarrassing <SEP> If a non-white person cuts a track that makes fun of and is demeaning toward Chinese culture, then what?  Because that is what this is.  If you completely extract this part of the piece, there is some fairly nice avant garde percussion, but at what spiritual price?  I've heard some other Frank Wright and it was great.  I am not condemning him as a person, but this track is damn embarrassing."
"Good Version of Standard <SEP> Amanda Carr is always entertaining and as usual she here delivers a very fine performance of an old jazz standard.
She captures the energy and  demonstrates her versatility in a cover that is as good as any version I have ever heard."
"Composed and written well <SEP> The combination of the symphonic noise, the electronic beat and the lyrics mix into a melding of great music. It has so much meaning in it making you think sometimes when listening to it."
smooth <SEP> Saw this song in a film and I loved it. He has a great mixture of songs! Truly a classical!!
"High expectations <SEP> Sweet Comfort Band has remained my favorite band for 30 years. I've owned their first six albums on cassette, then LP and eventually CD. My expectations were high for the album and I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the lofty standard SCB set years ago. Was it possible to create a new album that didn't try to copy themselves but be contemporary and true to their own style? In an answer, yes!
This new album has exceeded my expectations. So many of the elements that made SCB my favorite is still there: the melodic style, sweet harmony and superb performances of each member. Even with Kevin T gone, the music is everything I loved. I do miss some things from past albums: more electric guitar and wider stereo imaging on the drum kit (I always loved that on their albums). Still, this album is a home run.
I don't know if it's my favorite album (honestly, I've never been able to pick one) but it's up there. I've been listening to it over and over for the last few weeks, mostly because I can't get the tunes out of my head. There's only one song that doesn't really do it for me, but there are a few other SCB songs that don't either. Hats off to Rick, Randy and Bryan for showing us that they have gotten better with age. I'm ready for album #8!"
"nice to listen to <SEP> I enjoyed listening to this, nice voice nice song. Not hugely original, but good. Will be looking for more from him."
I did not order this song but was charged for it <SEP> I give it 0 stars because I didn't order this one...I ordered Dance with me tonight - which I got and love - but I was also charged for this one. And it kind of sucks.
"Love It! <SEP> I heard this song at a concert once, and I immediately fell in love with it."
"don't waste your $! <SEP> The verse of this ""Can't Hold Us"" version (i.e. the rap) is ok...but the sung chorus
is HORRENDOUS!!  Don't waste your money on this download--very unhappy with this purchase."
Fetts Vette <SEP> It's a track that works as filler. It will get stuck in your head and you will sing it until someone slaps you with a brick.
Five Stars <SEP> Ruby Braff was a wonderful player.
Bull**** <SEP> I am seriously disappointed with the decision to replace Rizzle Kicks with Chitty whatever. The song was better as originally released in the UK.  Thanks record executives... you suck.
This was horrible. The singer sounded terrible <SEP> This was horrible. The singer sounded terrible. I want the 2 minutes of my life I wasted listening to this MESS.
"Crappy rip off <SEP> Wish they had clearer warnings when not original product, but someone trying to capitalize off original.  do not purchase if you are looking for the original or even passable version."
"Still not the song I heard on the radio!!! <SEP> Wasted my money on this thinking it was the Allternet mix by Macklamore. Still couldn't find it either, and BTW this song is garbage compared to Macklamore version!"
"cover of Can't Hold Us <SEP> The verses are ok (rapping), but the chorus is horrible. The guy is out of key; painful to listen to. I wish it had sampled the chorus for me before I purchased. Very unhappy."
"mcchris ownz <SEP> I have loved this song since the first time I heard it almost ten years ago. This song got me hooked on nerd rap. mcchris is a lyrical genius and an amazing person. I've met him after a show and he's a really down to earth guy. Support amazing musicians such as this. I only have one question, Where is my mcchris cartoon????"
MC Chris is the best! <SEP> MC Chris is a wordsmith!
Great Up-Tempo Version <SEP> good solos & arrangement...
"Terrific song. <SEP> This song deserve a higher ""popular"" rating than ""Adorn"" I am not too fond of some of the lyrics but this track stands on it's own."
"Fabulous CD! <SEP> I love the upbeat lyrics and the music is super... my pastor, his dad, the youth pastor, and pastor's brother-in-law is featured on this CD and Mynista comes to my church each year for our camp meeting, so I had to find out  what this was like! It was great like I knew it would be..."
"True Detective <SEP> Another bizarre, hypnotic, and disturbing piece of music selected by TBone Burnett that reinforces the ""darkness"" of the True Detective story.

""You're in Carcosa now."""
Warped Sense of Delivery <SEP> My album was totally warped. ..both of the double lp..are unfixable...very unsatisfied
"Has potential, but the vocals need serious reworking. <SEP> First the music: highly derivative (by design), in the style of various 80's college/alternative bands, most obviously Siouxie and The Banshees. It gets a bit irritating at times, but is (mostly) well executed, though tries too hard to make a statement and has some cliched phrasing that needed to be avoided. The whole point of adopting a style is to prune out the weak parts and adopt the best of it and bring it into the modern age. It mostly succeeds, but something's holding it back, and needs to not do so.

Now the singing: She's got a decent voice, but the lyrics are dreadfully melodramatic, corny, and boring, the styling is awful and cliched, with the ""I'm going to pause and hit a high note for the last word in the line to make it dramatic"" crap that took every fiber of my being not to hit ""next"". It comes across as a very bad 80's movie soundtrack, possibly one of the ""background bands"" in such a movie. I was interested to see the band approaching 40 and the singer be quite young. Somehow this figures in, and I can't put my finger on it.

So they have some real potential. They might just need a new singer. They might need to just know when a song is overdone. They REALLY need better lyrics. I hope they have a better offering the next time around. I'd like to like them. I like their influences."
Great song... <SEP> I already loved this song since I heard it on the radio and had to purchase it. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon mp3.
More Great Dance Music <SEP> Anything done by Offer Nissim and Maya is a hit!
One Star <SEP> Bad
Song <SEP> Got this song for free and put it on my play list at work.  It was not a great song to listen to at work.
trash is trash <SEP> why someone is calling this music is beyond me.  Maybe I'm just getting old and don't appreciate the newer stuff
"UGH! <SEP> I thought this song was disgusting..I'm glad I don't have any teenagers around to listen to this garbage.  I do have to say, I was curious about the song and listened to a portion of it."
"Bad Rabbits Kills It Every Time <SEP> Was lucky enough to see Bad Rabbits at a live show a few weeks ago....if you ever get the chance don't pass it up. They brought the house down and they were the opening band. Playing at a Hardcore show at that!!!

They very easily had every person up and on their feet the entire set.

Buy the CD - see the show!"
"If There's Anything There, I missed It... <SEP> OK, so Dave Chappel would dig this rapper.  Me?  Apparently missed out on something.  Can't get my hands on it, and if I did, somebody got a jar of Purell?  Booty calls goota show more respect than this.  Tappin' it demands a the right kind of connector...  OK, where did I hide my Snoop Dog cd?"
Great song by a gifted musician! <SEP> I loved it!  Huge fan of Chuck Gibson - great vocals!  I would recommend anything he has written or is a part of.
Five Stars <SEP> So ethereal.
Awesome song! <SEP> This song will shift the atmosphere and take your praise and worship to another level!
Awesome <SEP> I am new to this group but after hearing them on iHeart.com and watching a few of there videos on YouTube I took a chance and downloaded their album. I love it
Five Stars <SEP> Love love love this song! Has been my morning motivation and inspiration to keep moving forward in Jesus!
Spirit filled. <SEP> Awesome
Must have. <SEP> Must have great worship CD. You will not be disappointed.
"Very disappointed. I will make sure he gets the worst ... <SEP> Black vinyl instead of purple ?
Nandesuka corewa ? !

Vendor must be a japanese color blind.
The pitch said purple vinyl and I got a regular black vinyl.
Had I wanted a regular vinyl I certainly wouldn't have spent that amount and had it shipped from Osaka.
Very disappointed. I will make sure he gets the worst publicity from now on."
One Star <SEP> Not the right version
"Moving and beautiful tribute to our planet! <SEP> I received this as a gift, bought by chance by a friend, and found it so beautiful and moving--a true tribute to our planet and its inhabitants.  It is spiritual and beautiful and I have ordered several copies to give to friends.  I totally recommend it!"
one of the best new bands an cd of the year <SEP> ive  always been a fan of slik toxic  of all their cds an waited till nick walsh did something else  this cd is awesome an ive played over an over an every one thats herd it loves it so if u don't have it buy an if u read this an don't know who this is buy it anyways an u won't regret .  an what makes it even better is i oredered the cd from their site from the band an it got lost in the mail somehow an i waited an waited an still didn't recieve so they sent me a video a shirt a single an the cd signed hell an that cost them as mush as i payed for the cd an shipping so hows that for pleasin ur fans rock on revolver  buy the cd an join the revolution .
"have to purchase this through Amazon, and establish an ... <SEP> have to purchase this through Amazon, and establish an Amazon music library.  cannot see how else to purchase this as a regular MP3.  therefore I cancelled purchase, was unable to listen to this."
"Thank you Franz Liszt <SEP> There are 6 Grandes Etudes de Paganini but I have three favorites and this is one of them.  Thanks to Franz Liszt we who took the study of the piano seriously have been able to play these pieces originally written for the violin. This particular piece brings ""The Hunt"" into imaginary animation. Chong Park is masterful in his presentation and you will not be disappointed."
"digital download lacks information on each track <SEP> I downloaded this album and found that the tracks are not named in a manner that allows one to know what area the each song will target.  I know from the Dr. Oz website that Delta = SLEEP; Gamma = MEMORY, Harmonic = MIGRAINE the others I am not sure about.

Disappointing."
"dont like <SEP> There is a  horn blowing in the beginning that ruins the entire thing, and i don't want to use it for my wedding"
"CANCELLED ORDER BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CONCERT <SEP> I love the Statler Brothers and I've heard the full recording, so the only reason I gave this one star is because it does not include the entire concert.  Consequently, I cancelled my order for this CD before it was shipped.  Now I'm looking for the CD that includes the whole concert."
"Five Stars <SEP> Second, only to Fear"
To Knower is to Lover! <SEP> Just when you think the future ain't what it used to be there's Hyperloop! And Knower! It takes a lot to get me excited about new music - I want to actually hear something new - not the same old tried and true insert hit here chord changes. Knower's harmonic palette is other worldly!  Plus awesome vocals with spot-on pitch. Having had the pleasure of seeing them perform live I will say - Do not miss the opportunity to know Knower in the flesh!
"Five Stars <SEP> I graduated in 57, this is my song"
"Five Stars <SEP> INCREDIBLE voice ........HE reminds you of Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway & Will Downing"
I love it. all praise be to God <SEP> I love it.all praise be to God..
Four Stars <SEP> Awesome
Five Stars <SEP> One of my favorite Gos songs ever!
Five Stars <SEP> Great Rainer Truby remix
Five Stars <SEP> Love this song and Frank Turner!
Five Stars <SEP> One of Lana's best songs in my personal opinion. It's glamorous and romantic. Give it a go!
"The worst theme in WWE history <SEP> I'm ashamed to say I was part of the crowd at RAW the night after WrestleMania 29 when the Fandangoing ""craze"" began. It's already dying down, but it was god-awful enough to induce vomiting in the short time it lasted. Fandango is a talentless wrestler and his music is even worse."
Nice song <SEP> It's a song.  I like it.
"Satisfied Overall <SEP> The sound quality is great overall and includes most of the tracks from the movie. However, the track ""The World Inside Your Eyes"" is not the instrumental version which is what I was expecting which kind of ruins the track for me other people might not mind it but I did. Same with the track ""If Tomorrow Comes"". However all the other tracks are there and sound magnificent ""The Dead Walk"", ""Escape Invasion"", ""Break Down"", and of course ""The Dead Suite."" Overall it's a great disc and if you like the movie and any of the music in it you should pick this up."
One Star <SEP> Not worth It $1.29 for a few second of a song
"Five Stars <SEP> Best old school song. Empowering, moving, mystic song."
GREAT SONG! GREAT VOICE <SEP> GREAT SONG ! GREAT VOICE !
"Seth is a talented singer/songwriter <SEP> I had the pleasure of meeting Seth and working with him at a Crowder concert in Detroit last year.  Very nice young man.  I purchased this download to support his music career and was very impressed.  In fact, I then purchased ""Good Hearts"" which was the release prior to this one.  I think ""Off With My Head"" is my favorite.  5 track offering that will leave you hoping he will put out another release SOON."
Two Stars <SEP> Not one of my favorites.
"The song length is a lie. <SEP> I had a free $2 in music downloads and I wanted to be the owner of the longest song that's <$2 on amazon. This song claims to be 66 hours and 25 minutes long but is actually only 4 minutes 48 seconds long. I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase.

The song itself is okay, I guess."
my wife is from india <SEP> why don't u have more indian songs to down load to the MP 3 player from your  site.. this would be a wonderful thing.. many of people from  india would love that so much...
Off tune. <SEP> Did not realize this was a cover. And a poor one when purchasing.
Four Stars <SEP> I really liked this!
Great songs! <SEP> Brought back a lot of memories! Great songs!
"It's fine but not the original <SEP> I thought this was the original singers.  It's fine but not the original, my bad."
Five Stars <SEP> Love downloading from Amazon always great quality
"Its okay if you can get over the moron that's reading it. <SEP> Its good if you want to get some recovery in while you're doing other things that prevent you from actually reading your big-book.  But whoever they got to read this book did a very horrible job.  I honestly wouldn't put this guy's reading ability above an eighth grade level.  On top of that, he is very, very, boring to listen to.  I find myself skipping these tracks sometimes on my mp3 player because he is simply too mind-numbing to listen to for twenty minutes at a time.

Dear Alcoholics Anonymous, if you ever want someone to re-record this book that can actually do a good job of it; shoot me an email (or any other person in the world who has graduated high school) and i can guarantee you we'd do a better job than the idiot you hired."
"Misleading Title <SEP> If you are to listen to Lawrence Krauss, save your buck and move on. Professor Krauss speaks just for a few minutes out of the hour. The rest of the show is not worth the time. They should remove Professor Krauss's name from the title, I don't see how he was their guest when he spoke just for 3 minutes of the show."
"Interesting music, technically unsatisfactory product <SEP> The music is interesting. Liszt is one of many composers that I enjoy occasionally, but I do not know him well. I had not heard the Pelerinage before. It taught me something about Liszt. It is less dramatic and smaller in format than anything I knew before, sometimes pensive, almost meditative. I did not know that Liszt could write like that.

But disk 2 band 10 (Tarantella) is defective. It stops after 3 min 26 sec, tries several times to back up a second and continue, but does not succeeed. And the booklet is in Chinese!"
Two Stars <SEP> I thought it was a cd
"Very calming! <SEP> This is great music for resting, relaxing and going to sleep with I would recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of down time."
"Nice song! <SEP> I purchased an Ace of Base CD and got a $1 Amazon MP3 credit, so I decided to buy a song I really enjoy. This song has been stuck in my head for months now, with its catchy beat and irresistible chorus. Justin Bieber is a nice touch on the chorus part. A definite summer hit for sure."
One Star <SEP> The song is amazing but has yet to show up on my phine 
Multiply Your Income <SEP> I believe in subliminal but I don't know if this works.  I feel the same and see no difference.  I wish I knew what they were saying.  I don't like it when the guy does the warning at the end. I usually listen to these at night while I am sleeping.
One Star <SEP> Not mine
It didn't worked for me... <SEP> It didn't worked. I have try it now for over a month a nothing has changed. I don't recommend this product. It is a phonie.
WOW! <SEP> Where did this come from. This has to be the best album I've heard since the 1990's. Infectious beet and rhythms and man it gotta little of Fela Kuti and European electric music of the late 1990's but still holds it own sound. Gotta get up and dance.
"Awsome, inspiratioal , mature and just a bit dark! <SEP> Great album! What a refreshing stomp from Africa! Hang on, its a wild ride that should be played loudly on the best speakers you can find. Headphone? Don't bother. These tracks are to big for headphones!"
Looks new but skipped <SEP> Looks new but skipped. Will not play through. Highly disappointed and don't think I can purchase more from site due to this being a common problem with 45 purchases from this site.
"Beware...fake junk <SEP> I wish Amazon allowed a zero star review,  this is an album that will only sell to the inexperienced Amazon buyer who will be sorely disappointed that these aren't the 'real' songs. They are faked by some rip off band.  Look for the name to the original artist in the song name and avoid (recorded),  those have been remade by the original artist usually at a much larger date and not always with the original name band members.
Just be very careful when buying music on Amazon,  the fake junk vastly out numbers the real music."
"One Star <SEP> damn did not read previous review
not the original artists
bummer"
One Star <SEP> Not the original artists ...
Lois Lane <SEP> How could I or any of your friends back on Long Island ever forget the live version you performed at the mansion in Huntington Bay last summer? This is a timeless classic song.
Five Stars <SEP> Utterly unique and deep sonic art.
awesome <SEP> Blessed by it. It uplifts my spirit and beings mu up when I am feeling down. There is nothing like the word of God!!
"Great Quality and Quantity <SEP> Quick review: Quality and Quantity are great.  I'm not an expert, but have been listening to Chopin complete sets for years, and I did pick up different voicings in this set that I enjoyed.  Notes: I am biased on these big sets for low $, as you'll see in my other reviews."
"VoxBox Chopin disappoints <SEP> These are old recordings, and they have a lot of background noise, pops, and rumbles.  Ok, I tossed a dollar to the monkey grinder and the monkey tipped his hat to me, but I can make better use of my disk drive space than this garbage."
Five Stars <SEP> Incredible collection.
"Not one of my wisest purchases. <SEP> Some really hot jazz in this album, but most of the works are ho-hum and evoke nothing more than a desire for a glass of water.  Regretfully, a number of pieces were recorded in someone's living room rather than in a recording studio - background noises heard are NOT part of the scores.

Not one of my wisest purchases."
"A relaxing variety of great original and cover songs <SEP> A relaxing variety of great original and cover songs. This is truly a romantic lovers album, pick up a copy and throw it on all night long."
Two Stars <SEP> Not that great. Not even lyrically.
ALL YEAH! <SEP> Once again Sammus did it again proving to phony rap stars and industry what the point of making a love song to sell downloads when there's no feel for it. The lyrics and beats DY-O-NMITE!
Just keep Laughing <SEP> This DVD is definitely worth every penny. It will keep you entertained and is fun to listen to at any time of the day. If you want to laugh a lot then you should certainly purchase Dale Zawada's Inciting Incident.
"Great debut album! <SEP> Having attended this recording live, and without being biased, I can say that I laughed both in a room with mostly strangers then, and listening to it alone now. (I'm sure there's a joke Dale would find somewhere for that.) For being a rising star on the Chicagoland comedy scene, Dale's timing and delivery are top-notch.

Do yourself a favor and preview each track; if you like what you hear, throw down the $9 for just short of an hour of good times! This is a polished routine and a job well done! Never a dull moment!"
Well worth the price of admission! <SEP> I paid $8.99 for this album it is worth much more than that. Dale's style is awesome and left me laughing so hard.  I am spreading the word because as a fan of comedy this album stands up on it's own and at such a low price you owe it to yourself to get the best cost to laugh ratio there is out there right now.
Five Stars <SEP> Great music. I listen to this when i'm in the gym
"Oh wow.  Modern Bluegrass, with a driving tempo <SEP> This band has been coming to our church in south Minneapolis once a year, providing musical accompaniment for our church services, for several years.  Nice people, great talent, and very sincere.

I bought this cd from their sale table after last week's service.  They brought me to tears, driving to work just now, when they sang about Jesus asking, ""Are My hobos sleeping in the roundhouse tonight?""

""Bullet Train"" features a tempo that will move you right past the speed limit if you're driving and not careful...

Tight, practiced, and professional, these folks are the real deal.

Their bass and banjo players are absolutely top notch, the soprano and the tenor are
clear, their diction penetrates my rusty old ears, and their spirit gets clear into my crusty old soul.  I'd be proud to have any of them in my house for dinner any time.

This is just a great album, and belongs in every bluegrass fan's library."
Five Stars <SEP> I love this artist
Five Stars <SEP> for marimba lovers.
"In Heinrich Boll's term, Abbado herein drank from the Host of the Beast <SEP> These are  two of Abbado's first HIP influenced/infected Haydn performances.  In his London Symphonies dozen,
they are polar opposites of his excellent  versions of #96 and the Sinfonia Concertante. with the proviso that  I prefer
Szell , Tate,Haitink , Van Beinum and Jochum in #96 and  both Ristenpart and Bernstein/NY in the Sinfonia Concertante..
HIP mannerisms of Abbado include wooden ,clipped and non-legato phrasing, and over-accented chords.  It sounds soulless
and zombified
Preferred versions of #102:  Klemperer/EMI, Jochum/DG; Walter/Sony; Tate/EMI, Bernstein/NY/Sony
  ""  #103  Jochum/DG, Tate/DG, Mackerras/Vanguard, Bernstein/NY/Sony"
Lighthouse by Fannny Fan : Fantasia <SEP> I love the Song Lighthouse. It is inspirational to keep doing you despite your hater.  I need clean Version Amazon!! I didn't know they  had one. I love the beat also!!! Go Fantasia and crew  that helped her make thhis record!! lLove ya La Shawn
"touching and Soulful <SEP> Love this song!  As soon as i heard it on Smash, I knew I had to have it.  Not disappointed!"
"Trio Los Pancos <SEP> Hello: Music like ""Trio Los Panchos"" is not easy to find. This music brings food to your spirit.
Thank you
mmreyes"
LOVE IT <SEP> I voted for Fantasia on American Idol.....She has Star Power.  Such An Amazing Voice!  This song is so addictive!  I absolutely LOVE IT!!!
Five Stars <SEP> I like this trio
Five Stars <SEP> Nice!
Fanny is back! <SEP> Fantasia tears the house down with this song.  Her entire album is noteworthy. The lyrics will hit home for many I'm sure.
Five Stars <SEP> love
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Great music on a shoddy disc <SEP> I had the vinyl version of this recording long ago and I have been looking for a CD version for several years. The music is all scripture and is very inspiring. I would give this CD a 4-5 rating for the music on it, but not for this particular disc.

The CD case cover was badly scratched and broken into several pieces when it arrived, so the packing was quite inadequate. There are NO mp3 tags on the songs, so all information has to be entered manually. Because of the lack of headers, my computer (less than 1 year old) would not recognize the disc as music and I had to use some workarounds to rip the album. The price was way too high for the quality of this product and the producers should be ashamed of bringing this low quality to market."
Five Stars <SEP> a great funny story
a hit! <SEP> steve martin rocks the fiddle in this bluegrass number. edie brickell goes it also. a nice surprise for steve martin fans.
Good solid music! <SEP> Very fun and catchy. They perform very well together. Perfect tunes for summertime. Wish Paul Simon had done a cameo though.
"Need a better drummer <SEP> ugh, way too overdone, loud and no video to speak of.  Boring."
"Not Pleased <SEP> I do understand it is a free county and we do have that right given to us by our constitution, however, why is it necessary to make music like this?  When I actually listened to the words I was so appalled, the beat is catchy and that is why children like to listen, but what they don't realize is the trash that is going into their brains with stuff like this..  I was not pleased with this download and made my child delete the song and I have since started to monitor more carefully what we listen to.  I would hope that this song doesn't represent anyone from AMAZON..  I love amazon and love being able to find anything on here.

Thank you"
Five Stars <SEP> My babies love this song. All day jesus !!!
Five Stars <SEP> Awesome song. Love his devotion to Christ through his woman.
Great music <SEP> Great music
Earnest Pugh <SEP> I'm not fond of this kind of music but I do appreciate the fact that he seems to love the Lord.
"u got a 1 star touch with this one <SEP> I like ""In the Mood"" & ""Touch"".....

I can sense a bit of pop...nothing else really comes to mind.

You got style. Just hope your significant other knows a different kind of dude in the sheets from what I'm picking up with my ears."
User Unfriendly <SEP> I bought it as an mp3 but can't find it or transfer the song to my i Tunes. I will no longer buy Amazon's mp3 music until it is much easier to navigate.
shortened version <SEP> song cuts off like halfway through?  the whole second and final verse get faded out.  it was only pennies but still felt cheated
Holy Hip Hop <SEP> Kindgdon Business is the jam. I pump it in the ride and my 6yr old son loves it as well. Wish I would blast it more often. Canton Jone's kindgon business is right next to Mary Mary & Kirk Franklin. The compilation's are great. If he didn't visit my chuch (NewBirth) and give us I concert I would've missed his music all together. Buy Vol2 also It's slammin' secular style beat's and godd godly context on to. NOW that's NICE!!!
"He's done better <SEP> This cd should be entitled Going out of Business.  I am a fan of CaJo's work,but this one just was not one of his best.  I usually preview my cds on Amazon before I purchase them, but with CaJo, I just automatically purchased because he has never let me down.  Well, never say never."
"RUNWAY ALERT! <SEP> For those who know what ""runway"" means, this is ""the record"" you want. It's got sass, energy and that 'legendary' sound that we're always seeking."
I love this song as it describes my husband and he ... <SEP> I love this song as it describes my husband and he knows it. I never miss an opportunity to rub it in his face!
Five Stars <SEP> This whole Album is 100%
"get ringling road <SEP> Being friends with william is one of the best things, i couldn't ask for more.  The cd is great and his ringling road album also."
GREAT! ! <SEP> WCG is incredible on this album. Listen to this one start to finish. Great Texas country music!
"Memories <SEP> Listening to the blending of instruments, I close my eyes and envision a place free of sorrow, a restful spot where I can lay down my burdens if only for awhile.  This music will rejuvenate and inspire the listener.  I highly recommend it."
The best Sanskrit by far <SEP> The best Sanskrit by far . I first heard of it via Spotify and liked it so  I bought it .  I leave it playing throughout the house and patio . My Neighbors have enjoyed it very much .
"If you're looking to chant the chakra sounds, you've found it <SEP> There are many ""chakra"" CDs available, but this one is the one to get if you're looking to chant the traditional words and sound frequencies associated with each of the seven major chakras."
"""Trick Box Woman With A Body To Rub..."" <SEP> The story behind this artist deserves attention.  ""Street Kids"" was originally from the ""Rock Da Box"" LP from the early eighties. The other songs are country/rock oriented, and are a mini tribute to the Pacific Northwest.  After some hunting, it seems clear that Mr. Trenta was a victim of shady business practices by the defunct Creative Sounds Ltd. & Koala Records of Henderson, TN.  Also, Billy Joel was the namesake on an album that contained about 40% of Trenta's material (unbeknownst to Joel).  All this being said, these recordings by ""Cap'n Jonny"" are interesting to say the least, but the history behind it deserves a proper format!"
"ThorNton Creek's ""Fancypants""; Their Best Work to Date! <SEP> I don't usually gush about a new cd, but I'm using my wife's Amazon account for a moment to tell you about a new collection of great music that's truly something special. I host a weekly jazz/rock radio show in Emory, Virginia and ThorNton Creek has been on my playlist for quite a while.  When I learned that their newest cd ""Fancypants"" was about to be released last month I wrote the band and begged for an advance copy, and I'm very glad I did because ""Fancypants"" is their best album to date.  It's a  terrific cd, sounds better with each new listening and it crosses over very well with fans of adult alternative, new country, and Americana music. Plus, there's a great rock track, an excellent blues track, and throughout the entire cd there's a solid foundation of top-class musicianship. The songwriting is some of ThorNton Creek's best ever; very soulful, reflecting both a depth of maturity and a freshness of spirit that invigorates the listener. This is a ""can't miss"" collection of some of ThorNton Creek's best work to date and I recommend it highly.  My recommendation: Buy ""Fancypants"" today!

Host of ""Myriad"" on WEHC-FM, Emory, Virginia"
"Modern Filk <SEP> Back in the day, I used to listen to cassette tapes ordered from magazines composed by musical artists who wrote songs based upon and referencing items of science fiction and fantasy culture, from D&D to Star Trek.  This genre of music was called 'filk' (For 'fiction/folk' music)
It's so common nowadays for people to make their own music inspired by video games, movies and otherwise that the genre no longer seems capable of being contained in a single word anymore- but listening to Dream of the Sky, and other Miracle of song tracks, I hear a professionalism that takes me back to listening to the old cassettes, and knowing there was a real love for the things in the songs which made them seem important, and helped expand the enjoyment of that thing beyond simply the initial experience."
"Great song. Poorly encoded Amazon <SEP> I have to qualify this review. The song itself is a wonderful song. But as I've already pointed out to amazon. When they uploaded it to their servers they did so as a 15 second preview. If you buy this song, you will only get a choppy 15 second clip, not the full length track."
"Chameleon <SEP> This song has clever lyrics, but they're sang with little heart. Nick obviously is a chameleon, frequently changing his sound, look and genre to suit the occasion. Although he had a hilariously entertaining stage presence, the band had no right winning the 2012 Road to Memphis Blues Challenge and wasn't even in the same league as the competition. The band successfully duped the judges, which I'll blame on the weather. The album is appropriately named, Who Ya Kiddin'."
Five Stars <SEP> Matt Maher is one of my favorite Christian artists.
Five Stars <SEP> Just a great christian song
Love it! <SEP> Amen to this song love  love  love it! Sounds amazing live. Love the spiritual feeling I get with this song!
"Does not have all the songs in this movie <SEP> Very upset at Amazon for not having good collection of Hindi songs. This album I bought does not have all the songs of the movie!! It missed my favorite song in the movie!

There are a Billion people out there that tune in to Bollywood music.

I expect Amazon to up their ante in making Bollywood music and movies available as soon as possible.

I am eager to PAY amazon for good Bollywood content. I already buy lots of shows from Amazon Digital. But very upset it does not cover Bollywood well.

Aren't most people (programmers) who work for Amazon Indian anyways.. Can't see why the heck this gap."
Five Stars <SEP> excellent
"Mesmerizing <SEP> The only thing better than listening to this is seeing Mike Slo-Mo Brenner in person, where you can watch him play that amazing guitar.  For anyone who liked sitar music in the 60's, this is an updated version which will really draw you in."
Amazing Music <SEP> My husband loves Russian Techno/Dance music.  It's really hard to find in the US.  He didn't even know about this CD so when he opened it for his birthday he was super excited.  He added it to his IPOD and listens to it very ofter.  A great buy - truly a needle in a haystack - and a great cost!  Thanks for posting!
Five Stars <SEP> LOL!
"Atlee classic cd. <SEP> ATLEE rocks just buy it try it you can't deny it. Good variety of styles from dirty old man ( nice cowbell addition ) to painted ladies that sounds real smooth and swamp rhythm, ready for some fresh fried frog legs?. Classic cd."
Five Stars <SEP> I love them
Jess <SEP> Good listening.
Where is the raw energy? <SEP> Big Joe fan but this disc just does nothing for me compared to the first recording the remake of the Blood Sweat and Tears number just sets the tone of blah. More Than you will ever know should have been a landmark  The duets on live at the Beacon had the Big Brother vibe that is missing here
Bleh. <SEP> I like both these artists. But it did seem a bit like they were phoning it in on this cut.
One Star <SEP> There was no story.
Skips like a CD <SEP> This song skips like a CD. Do not purchase. iTunes version is exactly the same. The song doesn't begin to skip like a dirty CD until the middle of it.
ONE OF A KIND SONG <SEP> CLASSIC GUITAR SONG
"GREAT SONG <SEP> Love the lyrics, the beat and arrangements!  My favorite and I listen to it all the time!!!"
"Great song! <SEP> Alana Aldea is one of my favorite female vocalists, so I got this song with several others when I searched for her on Amazon.  I have not heard of Wezz Devall or their works, but I do really like this song.

It's got a great beat to move to, and the vocals are upbeat and even bubbly at times.  While bubbly vocals aren't my thing, this song is an exception, and it's very easy to get dancing while listening to this.  Check it out if you like Alana Aldea and/or Vocal Trance."
grand piano canyon <SEP> I was looking for BobJames album Grand Piano canyon. I didn't like this. I want the right album.. I don't know why nobody puts this album on either I tunes or mp -3  lists.  I liked this album so well I bought it on Cassey and two times on CD.
"Great music for life's journey <SEP> Adam and Kizzie are an amazing musical duo. This is a great album! Their fans have been waiting for it and it does not disappoint.  Adam is masterful on the keyboard. Kizzie's vocals pierce the soul. The lyrics of the songs will take you on journeys and you will be glad you got on board the ""Train"". You will mourn lost love, celebrate love found, and seek to love your true self. You will want to dance. Your head will bounce. You may rock from side to side. or you may just sit back, close your eyes, meditate a bit, feel the groove, or just think. It's listed as R & B. But after listening to it, I defy you to squeeze it into one category. Great work By Adam and Kizzie. And a ""wooty woo woo!"" to their engineer, J Lee, the producer aka Josh Norman. Buy the album. All 8 tracks will touch you."
One Star <SEP> Fake
Excellent album! <SEP> Excellent! I've been a This Century fan for a few years now. I bought this album a few weeks ago and haven't had a day where I don't listen to a song or the entire album because one of these songs gets stuck in my head. The entire album is great. There is not one song that you'll be disappointed with. Buy this album.
"Excellant <SEP> It's a real shame this song was not on the Hunger Games Album.  It would have been a huge improvement, that said I still liked most of the songs on the album also. But this one would have been great."
Great!! <SEP> Very hot!! Love the rhythms and lyrics. Keaira LaShae is a diva!! Off the charts and definitely the latest sound in Black music!
Amazing artist <SEP> This artist is Amazing!!! When I first heard this song I just feel in love with it and I couldn't wait till this song came out
This is better <SEP> I grew up with the original version by sly fox at the time it was ok but this remake of the classic so is much better than the Orignal version by sly fox.  Some of the songs I grew up on in the 80's are being remade which I like the newer version and old versions and some shouldn't even be touched.
"Always great music from Composer Brian Tyler, he's my favorite! <SEP> Brian Tyler rocks!  You need to check out the video on YouTube to watch his orchestra perform this life!"
Four Stars <SEP> Wonderful worship song
Great song. <SEP> Great song.  Downloaded for my son to sing special at church.
Five Stars <SEP> Love it!
"Daniel O'Donnell's recording of HOW GREAT THOU ART  HEARTLAND  PBS  recording <SEP> Daniel O'Donnell's recording of HOW GREAT THOU ART
HEARTLAND  PBS  recording

at the tail end he make comments that could have been eliminated from
this recording.  I wanted the music.

I thought he sang it rather slow.

I will order another rendition of him singing this song."
"I found it!!! <SEP> This tune has haunted me for years! After all this time I have found out the title to this song. Thankfully, Amazon had it as an MP3 download and I can listen to it, to my heart's content."
"Love the colors very soft fabric just wish they were ... <SEP> Love the colors very soft fabric just wish they were the correct size? I ordered 18 X 18 as described, but they were only 16 x 16? now have to find a filling to fit into them? Disappointed"
Four Stars <SEP> Very nice covers. Zipper broke but still nice.
Five Stars <SEP> Classic favorite.
"The King is Perfect, song conversion sucks. <SEP> Great song.  Immortal singer.  Lousy transfer to mp.  Sounds like you're listening through a tin can with slack string from about a hundred miles away.  Otherwise, who can complain about Elvis?"
"Lucero <SEP> Lucero continues to rock, their next album should be amazing and I can't wait!
Texas and Tennessee is a winner, sad whiskey drenched songs."
One Star <SEP> This is not the full version of the song.
"but when I downloaded this & played this song it started like half way through <SEP> I don't know about you, but when I downloaded this & played this song it started like half way through. I did everything I could, but it just won't play at the start for me. If it were the full song, I'd give it 2 & 1/2 more stars."
"Denace's new album <SEP> Here are the things you need to know about this album:

1. Denace sounds strikingly like Eminem. Some people believe Denace sounds like Eminem, and feel bad for Denace. I disagree. I believe he tries hard to sound like Eminem. He has made it his niche. I wonder, if he didn't go out of his way to sound like Eminem (e.g. yelling rather than rapping, constantly referencing Eminem) would he have even the small following he does? The material is also reminiscent of Eminem. But he is quite obviously not at Em's level, so he's a poor man's Eminem at the end of the day.
2. Denace does not have Dr. Dre producing this album. In fact, I'm not sure anyone produced this album alongside Denace. Thus, think of Eminem's Infinite rather than The Marshall Mathers LP when comparing the two artists. Denace lacks the high quality production. And it's too bad, because he has a ton of talent. He is SO CLOSE to being worthy of the next ""huge"" artist label. But, the lack of production quality is going to kill this album. The best example is Track #1, a take on ""Imagine"" by John Lennon. If the production quality were slightly higher this would superior to 90% of Eminem's tracks. And I say that as a die-hard Shady fan.
3. Denace is an up-and-comer, but he's not quite there yet. His lyrics are still slightly lacking. He just doesn't quite have the verbiage down pat. I really believe he needs to work alongside someone of the upper echelon in rap while making an album. His lyrics would be more rounded out. He would put the finishing touches on finding his voice. And he'd be ready for selling out stadiums.
4. It is parental advisory, but forced. Just listen to Track #5 - I'm not saying everyone should avoid cursing and follow Will Smith's approach. What I'm saying is that when someone is forcing cursing and situational PA's it sounds dumb. In Track #5 Denace focuses on being a pimp. He's not a pimp. We can tell. He just sounds dumb when rapping about choking a girl for not giving him the $400 she owes him as her pimp. C'mon...

I want so badly to recommend others to purchase this album. But alas, I can't. Denace is not quite ready for a $10 MP3 download. It's not the quality I would expect. He needs to get a better production team, a lyricist to work with him, someone to work on his voice and lyrical projection, and he needs to pay for a better studio (this was obviously not recorded with high quality equipment - or else the person recording it didn't know how to use the equipment).

Do not buy this album - or at a minimum listen to a few songs on YouTube first. I sincerely hope a high quality rapper hears this album, sees there is immense opportunity here, and offers Denace the aforementioned necessities. Let's hope the next Denace album is a ""10"", because he has the ability!"
One Star <SEP> Did not get lucky...
Five Stars <SEP> love this song
wonderful <SEP> great song
This tune gets in your head and i for one can't shake it! <SEP> This tune gets in your head and i for one can't shake it!  driving my wife nuts with it! Ha
Five Stars <SEP> LOVE IT
Not a good purchase <SEP> The songs don't start from the beginning.  I purchased for my daughter to practice for the upcoming production of this musical
"It sounds like it was ""cut"" out of a dance mix with ... <SEP> Not the version I really wanted. It sounds like it was ""cut"" out of a dance mix with a cold ending."
"Best Indie Game Soundtrack This Year <SEP> I've absolutely fallen in love with this soundtrack while playing legend of dungeon. At first glance it begins with such subtly but as you play the well coded bits load in based on the monsters and severity of your situation. The tracks, while seemingly fine on their own, blend into this intense melody that makes you sweat/comforts you/scares you/or instills panic in your heart.

I will be following this artists and any future projects he's involved in."
Not the original song <SEP> It's not the full song and was a complete waste of 99 cents. I found the full song on beatport.
"NEVER ABLE TO DOWNLOAD OR GET HELP <SEP> I've heard this song on Youtube and friends have seen him in concert. He is amazing. His creative use of his own body as a musical instrument beats the hell out of some of that crap heavy metal s*** out there. Did you know heavy metal music kills plants....read about it in ""The Secret Life Of Plants"" and above all; avoid heavy metal like the plague that it is.  Hell, plants create oxygen you morons. Until we vibrate at a higher frequency and enter the 4th dimension ( I am being facetious here and am sick to death of the 4th dimension B.S.) humans need oxygen to survive.  If we all die, who will buy your heavy metal s***?"
Five Stars <SEP> A fun blast from the past.
"A classic! <SEP> Anybody who knows this track doesn't need my review, it's as intriguing as it ever was, and even more so if you know the story behind the KLF, a musical entity known for dipping into Illuminati myth and media trickstering. As a result, this track is very difficult to hunt down - the KLF's doing, no doubt - so I was shocked that I found it on Amazon. Long live the Ancients."
Five Stars <SEP> Red Dirt. Can't go wrong.
"Bad vesion of a great song <SEP> This song deserves better than Rogers half-assed Bubba version. There's poignancy in here that totally eludes the Red Dirt Frat Boy flag bearer.
Maybe one day, co-writer Jamie Lyn Wilson will grace us by recording her version, which brings every layer of intricacy to light."
Two Stars <SEP> I purchased the wrong song

I ordered this by mistake from Japan & returned it when I realised my error"
Not happy. <SEP> The download skips. Not happy.
"If I were a Bell <SEP> One of my favorite Brando movies.  Who knew Jean could sing so well.
Dinah Washington owns this song in terms of singing abilities, but this is a good rendition"
One Star <SEP> Still depressed so not sure what else to say.
Horrible people. Mediocre music. <SEP> I would never buy anything from these guys. Cole decided to carve his name into a national monument in Montana. Completely unacceptable!!! He said he did it because his wife has a lump on her breast... What's next? Jack hammering his name across the face of The Statue of Liberty?
Pathetic <SEP> Been a fan folk music for 20 years.  This is some worst trash ever heard.  Really have no talent for this. should stick to defalcating national monuments.
WHO SINGS WHAT??? <SEP> It might help if one of the sellers EXPLAINED which songs on here are sung by Roberta Sherwood and which ones by Marilyn Maxwell (a blonde actress from the 50's who I didn't even know was a singer!)  This particular album is very confusing ----- I certainly agree with the one reviewer that Roberta Sherwood was one of the greatest song stylists who ever blessed our EARS!  But there just needs to be more explanation about the content.
"This is a wonderful song, and for me <SEP> This is a wonderful song, and for me. the soprano dominant version is the best as compared to the tenor, alto, or bass predominant versions."
"Find another source <SEP> The music is from the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the scratches and surface noises are from the vinyl LP from which this recording was transcribed. I was very disappointed in the quality of the recording, on this track AND the other two that I downloaded."
Best! <SEP> Joyful music in the best rendition. By the master!
"Find another source <SEP> The music is from the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the scratches and surface noises are from the vinyl LP from which this recording was transcribed. I was very disappointed in the quality of the recording, on this track AND the other two that I downloaded."
"get this one <SEP> this is an amazing song , loved it very much"
One Star <SEP> terrible
"Five Stars <SEP> Awesome album! If you like Viking Metal or Death Metal, you gotta check out Wulfgar!"
"Two for One <SEP> Excellent pick because you get live versions of some Outlaw rarities like Angels Hide, and a good selection of songs from the Henry Paul Band as well.........Buy it!!!!"
"The Gang is back. <SEP> Not as tightly wrapped (or rapped) as the original.  (That was an album I could listen to front to back with ease), though this does capture some of the crass funk of the original.  It's a solid album all around, but the first one blew me away."
Five Stars <SEP> Love Nana
"Serj does it again! <SEP> Serj Tankian is unbelievably talented. His Solo albums are incredible. Now this. A four act Orca Symphony is pure bliss. At $3.96, you can not go wrong. Very soothing. I enjoyed the live album with the orchestra also. This is just a much purer sound. Thanks for more great music!"
stinks!!!!! <SEP> OMG!!! This is the worst product! All the songs sound the same and it's such a rip off! Don't you dare download it!!!! Listen to the songs and you'll see what I mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Two Stars <SEP> I like the song, but I thought I was buying the CD with all the songs, not just one."
"I recall hearing some of Ray Price's easy listening style years ago when I had a cassette ... <SEP> I recall hearing some of Ray Price's easy listening style years ago when I had a cassette of some of his so called best songs.
First, I am not really a country music fan, but I was hoping that this would parallel somewhere close to Andy Williams or even
Perry Como.  Well, it is extremely easy and overwhelmingly depressing. I downloaded this hoping that it would not be that
somber, but one may definitely require therapy after any repeated listens.  I could not stand to listen to the whole album in
its' entirety.  Warning, stay away unless you want to remain in a depressive state."
not the original <SEP> Its not toeh original and they did not mention that in the description.  I hate that about some of the mps I buy from my phones.
"The recording are not recorded at the same sound levels ... <SEP> The recording are not recorded at the same sound levels. Obviously this a ""mix tape"" type product. Many different sources as well as recording sessions. Very disconcerting"
Unappealing <SEP> There is a tonal quality that is just not appealing t o me.  This is another that I will just delete.
"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY <SEP> Maybe the average sucker can't tell the difference between Luke Bryan's voice and some studio goon, but for me it's painfully clear that every song on hear is a cheap knock off.  I just don't get, why go to the trouble, why not just sell the real and finalized copies of the songs?  Buy songs from real labels and musicians, not from these weird knock-offs."
Two Stars <SEP> Just okay.
get your spiritual breakthrough........ <SEP> Gospel music is the best way for relaxing
This song quite simply is just an ass kicking great song in fact much of what I've heard from ... <SEP> This song quite simply is just an ass kicking great song in fact much of what I've heard from this outfit is better than MANY others!  You owe it to yourself to jump right in & enjoy.....
"Beautiful in Many Ways <SEP> I love this recording and just wish there were more like it. Since downloading it elsewhere, I've used it for meditation several times a week. The music is calming and beautiful and the narrator's voice is so soothing. But by far the best aspect is the quality of the lessons. Since including this album in my spiritual journey, I can honestly say I have drawn closer to Earth and our Creator God. It has been a blessing."
"She still loves me, she still loves me... <SEP> Jawaiian at its best. I really jam to this song every day of the week. Collie Buddz gave it more. Great song on the islands."
"Not what you think <SEP> If you want the gospel Christmas song ""Go Tell It On the Mountain"", beware; this is just the chorus repeated over and over again without any of the actual verses."
"meh <SEP> had I known it was an orchestra covering romantic tunes, I would not have bought it

the fault of the bad purchase was entirely mine as Amazon give buyers a chance to sample the music prior to purchase, so the two starts is not in any way directed toward the good folks at Amazon

two stars for the album though, I'd give up my rights to listen to it if I could get my money back, i'll never listen to it again"
"GA and T-Haddy had outdid themselves! <SEP> Wow, what can I say?!? Gideonz Army and T-Haddy really did an amazing job with this project.  The way the album is put together is near to perfect.  A truly great story mixed with sweet beats and truth in the music sets them apart.  One of my favorite styles of Christian Hip-Hop/Rap is using some R&B with rap.  This album is worth it.  Go get em' 3MG."
real <SEP> I understand where these guys are coming from with their ministry. I grew up not listening to traditional gospel and really didn't understand it. Gospel rap was so relatable to my life and ordinary guys like this are freeing a lot of people from secular rap. Praise God!
Terrible <SEP> Virtually all of these salsa songs consist of very elementary rhythm sounds.  There is not any coherent melody or sophisticated tune.  They almost all sound as if made by some inexpensive electronic instrument.  They are all instrumental..... No vocalists singing at all.
One Star <SEP> This record skipped so much that we returned it.
"Love the album <SEP> The description for this item says the records were colored, but they are just black. Love the album, but was disappointed to find this out."
"Pussy Galores 1st 12"" ep <SEP> The review I wrote had the word in the title of the ep & it was never printed. Needless to say if you know Pussy Galore this is an early sloppy beautiful Vinyl Record Store Day release with the hidden cut. This along with most of thier releases up to & including ""Pussy Gold 2000"" are on the compilation CD Pussy Galore ""Corpse Love."" But to have a vinyl record & cover or picture sleeve in your hands...there's nothing like it. While you're out there serching for Jon Spencer/Pussy Galore collectables, try to get your hands on the 2 ultra rare Sub>Pop singles club 7"" Pussy Galore split single with Tad (released around 1989) doing 2 Black Flag songs, each take a turn at Damaged 1 bw/ Damaged 2.
In 1992 there was a Christmas 7"" by Jon Spencer ""My Christmas Wish"" on Green Vinyl. The 2 songs from the Christmas 7"" are now on the In The Red records CD Juke Box singles collection. (I Have Most of the cuts on the Juke Box 7"" collection with the Jukebox strips) or compilations from Matador whom The Blues Explosion are no longer with.
Get it & everything else you can. Especially the last Pussy Galore lp with Bob Bert drums (Sonic Youth-Bewitched-Chrome Cranks)Jon Spencer (Blues Explosion/Boss Hog w/ his wife Christina also former P.G.) Neil Haggerty (Royal Trux) ""Historia De La Musica Rock"" with only 3 members. The cover is a mock cheapo 70's style compilation with fake other comps. included. A totale rip off that is ""Brilliant"" It includes ""Little Red Rooster"" ""Craw Fish"" ""Revolution Summer"" and more. This is an underrated lp & Neil Haggerty's Rolling Stones fixation is evident in abundance. (Pussy Galore did a cassette only of ""Exile On Main St"" in it's entirety, a few show up on ""Corpse Love"") One last item, there was an lp length record released on The Membrains label Vinyl Drip that included at least 3 eps. Those records came & went if your local record store had them at all in the 80's. I Love Vinyl searching(and finding!!)

"Shearly for the collectibility of the album on vinyl <SEP> Cool idea bro, but getting together 4 turntables, receivers,and speakers is a little rough. Just sayin. If anyone has an idea about getting this together I'd love to hear it. :-)"
Awful as can be <SEP> Buyer beware this cd does not contain any of the the original recordings. This collection Sounds like the elevator music from Hell. No Thank You.
Five Stars <SEP> Thank you
Five Stars <SEP> sweet
"Not original <SEP> Its hard to tell in the song previews, but these are not the original theme songs, just covers. It would have been nice if that was in the description."
Five Stars <SEP> They still got it after all these years on the battlefield for the Lord.
Five Stars <SEP> the brothers and I will be singing this one Sunday
What a date <SEP> This reminded me of a date that started with dinner and a movie and wonderful conversation.  Thanks for the memories Ron!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Great song
"Experienced <SEP> This is a nice song, with a nice beat. He's able to move up to the speed of other artists, no matter what. He's brings crisp to any song arranged and introduced. I have always been a fan and will continue to be. Continue the great work. A+"
"One Star <SEP> Not mine, did not get this."
Four Stars <SEP> Tyght
"wonderful rod mckuen <SEP> excellent music to listen to - calming, soothing. listen to the words carefully - makes you think"
Five Stars <SEP> Love the Piano Guys! I find their music uplifting and inspiring. I use this to write to.
"great song - lousy review screen <SEP> great song
I would like to give good reviews to these songs however I am not happy that the system requires me to type in a certain number of words so until they change this I will either give no reviews or will copy and paste this one into every review if you don't like this talk to Amazon"
"Great musicians <SEP> I love these musicians...their DVD is great too.
I discovered these guys by accident and can't get enough of their superb music."
One Star <SEP> I never got my song
One Star <SEP> Have not been able to download file!
"Can't go wrong <SEP> I have many of ""The Piano Guys"" songs and albums.  Take my review with a grain of salt since I am very biased concerning these guys.  I have not heard anything that I didn't like."
Great Music! I loved hearing the piano Guys featuring ... <SEP> Great Music! I loved hearing the piano Guys featuring Lindsey Stirling! I heard of Lindsey Stirling but I never heard her perform the violin until I heard this music! Now I am a fan of Lindsey Stirling too!
love <SEP> I love this band and hope they continue to make their style of music. Band is good. Music is good. I will purchase in the future for sure.
Four Stars <SEP> Great track
"There's a reason this got them signed at the turn ... <SEP> There's a reason this got them signed at the turn of the century, but there's also a reason it wasn't widely released for many years."
Fun. I love it <SEP> Fun.  I love it!
Five Stars <SEP> I love these guys
"The Piano Guys! <SEP> The Piano guys seem to be this year's new classical hit.  You may like this song if you like Lord of the Rings, but it you are looking for just a few songs from the Piano Guys, there are many others that are better than this song."
Stupid moaning sounds <SEP> What a waste!  The short demo of the track plays some interesting and relaxing massage music.  Once you pay and are able to hear the entire track it is filled with stupid moaning and what I am guessing is supposed to be the sounds or pleasure.  What a waste!!!
"Someone is trying to become ""radio freindly"" to make a buck!!! <SEP> I will make this short and sweet.

I was a huge fan of Lifer, My Downfall, The Drama Club, and Breaking Benjamin.  I always thought Nick could make far like Ben did with the guitar duo they both once sang with.  I was wrong.  This is in no such way any combination of the bands they all previously played in.  While I was not expecting the same exact style, I was hoping for the originality and musicianship they showed in the past.  Not there.  I don't know what these boys were thinking (other than - how can we make a record to get radio play like all of the other not-so-great music being played now a days), but the I do know that the guitar style I have come to love is watered down and boring, and Nick does not use his strong vocals that he once had to make this CD anything but bland and not worth 1 listen. I think these guys missed big time with this effort."
Never gets old <SEP> This is a great workout song.
Check the cover photo <SEP> Picture on cover is Coltrane
Five Stars <SEP> Great
"Is this a joke? <SEP> Girl singing sounds like Cartman from South Park. Just terrible,not my style at all. Sounds like noise to me. Bring back the Cardinals!"
Five Stars <SEP> Genre busting excellence.
One Star <SEP> Not the song as described.
"Juan Gabriel is a great compouser <SEP> but a poor performer for hasta que te conoci ...the song is too long and he repeats the lyrics too many times
still he has a beatiful voice"
"Stellar performance - Lousy CD burn <SEP> I first heard this several weeks ago through the in flight entertainment system of an Asiana flight to Seoul.  I was immediately taken with it and made a note to seek it out when I got back home.  To my surprise, I found that it wasn't even available in the U.S. but that Amazon could get it from Korea through reseller, Softbay.  I got it today and the disk was defective.  It would drop out and skip tracks at random.  As the surface of the disk was pristine, no physical damage, it suggests that there may be a manufacturing problem with the way the disk was burned.  My fear is that this may have affected the whole production run.  To their credit, Amazon and Softbay are making the return and refund process painless.

Too bad, as Miss Wang certainly deserves better.  If Sony would burn it properly and release it in the U.S. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.

Update:

It's several months later and my son was able to buy me a copy of this CD in Korea and brought it back.  The burn is flawless, as it should be.  Here's hoping Sony will release this in the U.S."
Do you want to dance? <SEP> Great 80's flash back.
"Great Club Song <SEP> Great song to dance to in the club. All my ""Thug"" brothers represent, All my ""Thug"" sisters represent in the club:)"
Five Stars <SEP> I love this song and the price for it!
One Star <SEP> Ha ha ha ha.....  Dumbest thing ever
One Star <SEP> not the stadium version it claims to be :(
I love it! <SEP> If you are a fan of her earlier works then you will not be disappointed in her music. Thanks Eve for coming back to us.
too short <SEP> Too short.. got this song thinking it was the original.. Boy was I wrong. Don't waste your time . .
Dissappointed <SEP> Its not the one I was looking for!  I want the one with the goal horn on it! I can't get it to downolad onto my computer and the cloud doesn't work right on my computer!
Love it for studying <SEP> Recently went back to college and needed some background music for study time.  This is a great variety of music.
"but great! <SEP> ...only 4 cuts......not enough, but great!"
"I'd love to have this fixed <SEP> Same problem, when I went to unzip, it said the files are damaged.  I'd love to have this fixed."
"Won't Play in Windows Media Player - Windows 7 <SEP> Well, this is the only way I could find to provide feedback.  I downloaded and extracted the mp3 files.  They won't play on windows media player.  Well, they play noise - not music.  This is the first time I have experienced this with an Amazon mp3.  Did they change something - or am I doing something wrong.  Who knows.  Can;t find an obvious way to report this kind of problem."
save your ears... all song the same ... <SEP> save your ears...all song the same...
Not a good buy at all. <SEP> Boring music pieces. Anyone dancing to this would feel down. What a solid waste of $$$.
Unable to download <SEP> Unable to download
Love it <SEP> Ive always love their different take of music and their creative music videos.
One Star <SEP> a boatload of crapola
"Somethings can surprise you ... <SEP> When I first heard the original version by Adele, the very first thought I had was that this could definitely be one hellavu rock song and a male lead vocal would likely kill it.

I was blown away by how good this song has become in this new skin by Our Last Night. It would be insulting to call this a cover. This is a wonderful variation on a theme."
One Star <SEP> I love the historical speeches. WHY did they add music over top of the speeches?!?!?!?!
"Not very exciting stuff. <SEP> These songs are all pretty mediocre -- very standard ""un-tss un-tss"" dance music. If that's all you're looking for then it's fine, but I was hoping for something a little more complex. My favorite track is ""Rum n Coca Cola""."
Yum! <SEP> I love Michael's easy going style that feels so seamless. I could literally listen to this all day long. GET IT.
"NOT the version from the movie Caddyshack! <SEP> Yeah, it's the 1812 Overture, but it missing the extra instrumentation (piano and drums, if not more) that really makes the version in the movie stand out. Buying this is like paying for the Star Wars Theme but, instead of the John Williams & The London Symphony Orchestra soundtrack version, getting some generic orchestra playing with an unknown conductor. Yeah, technically the same song, but not really what you paid for. Luckily I'm only out 89 cents, but it's still weak."
"Heady Humboldt County Jam Band <SEP> Excellent jam band style music with all original songs. Great for driving, turned up very loud;)"
"Five Stars <SEP> This song was so wonderfully sung, what a blessing to me."
"Two Stars <SEP> Cheese ball red dirt song, was okay.."
Clean and Fresh <SEP> This artist is a friend of mine and is a this is just an amazing song. This would make a great addition to any music collection! This is his second single.
Love This! <SEP> This is a wonderful worship CD. Well composed and fun. The songs are upbeat and great to dance to. My husband and I as well as our two kids love it! They mashup popular secular music with worship songs for some of the songs wich is fun and everyone can sing along. Can't wait for more CD's from Marc Wymore and the young!
Great song!!! <SEP> Love this song!!!!
Five Stars <SEP> Very nice song.
"FLUNK CONTINUES THEIR BEST VOICE... AND PERFECTS IT! <SEP> Flunk solidifies their evolution on this album to be slightly less folk from their very early stuff and embraces their electronic nature further for an exquisite, ethereal, but very musical sound.  When I say ethereal, I do not mean this is background or atmospherical  sounds.  The very musical sounds with a terrific Scandinavian flavor are an absolute treasure!  Flunk settled down in their previous album, This is What You Get, and showed how the ethereal bent actually compliments  Anja's otherworldly voice.  It's the perfect combination.  This album solidifies that sound and gives substance to their sound.  It is my favorite Flunk album followed shortly be the last one I mentioned.

For those not familiar with Flunk and who like this kind of music, you are in for a treat.  Anja has that melancholy quality of Julee Cruise (old Twin Peaks soundtrack), yet adds greater depth, brightness and musicality.  There are also slight hints of Phantogram though I would not say either group influenced the other.  Maybe even a little bit of Dum Dum Girls but not so fifties influenced.

Queen of the Underground, Sanctuary, Bummed, and As if You Didn't Already Know were some favorites though all the tracks are great.  The first one I mentioned had the tiniest hints of a Naked And The Famous track (another fantastic group)."
Five Stars <SEP> it's a good getting over you song
Five Stars <SEP> Love the Nashville soundtrack!!!
