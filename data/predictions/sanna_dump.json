Elsewhere on the disc, a narrator describes \"the legend of Slim Shady\" in a parody of Westerns, and relates the tale of how Slim was \"shot in hte back\"  The word \"shto\" is edited  Taking out curse words is one thing, but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener!!!  It's espeically silly in a song like \"Role Model,\" where the message of the entire song is how Eminem is NOT a role model, and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}

{"reviewText": " I read some good reviews on this CD se tso I decided to buy it  At first I thought it was great, but after listening to the CDs a couple of times, I was not so thrilled.  The playing of many of the trios by Beaux Arts is very slow and seems to alck any spark or inspiration  Thsi is especially apparent to me in the Archduke trio  They grind along soooooo slow!!!  Beethoven was known for hi sbold music, but Beaux Arts seem to think that it is elevator music  I would suggest people get a recording tha thas more isnpired playing and better sound mixing", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}

{"reviewText": " taking the soul and innovation out of a form of music and replacing it with overly polished production is not progress it sjust watering down the music By the way Paul Okenfield is not the worlds' greatest dj he and his marketting taemj ust claim he is if you like 4/4 beats with on vocals and an empahasis on spirituality try anything on transmat anything by larry heard, ari lbrikha, stacey pullen's track vertigo, kenny larkin,  dagamas voyage by tony brown, or revenge of the jaguar by the aztec mystic\n\nyou want to hear some bada$$ techno try model 500, old cybotron, mr de, DIE,A xu Men (aux 88), mad mike, b calloway  anything on electrofunk, direct beat, metroplex, twilight 76, AMP, Pao Gao omvement, UR, puzzle box etc theres tons of good stuff out there but global underground isn't it. whatever you do tr ysome music with emotion isntead the vocalsa re suually the best part of house music check ou tchanges by imagination, move your body by marshal jefferson, or the goodlife by innercity, all classics and its the vocals that make all of themy ou don't need to use vocals sparinglylike these  sasha and digweed guys", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
{"reviewText": "Among the Definitive Albums of Progressive Trance If you are a fan of the progressive sound without any of the compromising filler or gross detractions, you will definitely want to acquire this cd to get a true taste of progressive by the master himself, Sasha!!!), the combined sound creates a unique ambience that entrances the listener.  No sudden peaks; no excessive head-ache hard trance, just smoothe mixing, soothing vocals, and plenty of wave sto satsify the progressive listener\n\nAs for comparison with GU009 and the Northern Exposure sets!!!  You won't find the eclectic tracklists or housier sounds of NE or San Francisco here!!!  It truly si a unique compilation which definitely sums up Sasha as the pioneer of the progressive sound", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
