{"reviewText": "Not the original Ink Spots I had hoped to hear the original recordings that I grew up with, but was disappointed to find songs interspersed between the originals that wer eclearly made later in time, and not by the original Ink Spots  The newer renditions aren't bad, but it's jarring to suddenly have such a different take - more orchestration - and entirely different vocals!!!", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}

{"reviewText": "diluted, and homogenized Sorry to burst anyones bubble but as fara s techno/house goes this is not the good $hitt lAl this \"progressive\" global underground crap is watered down trash taking the soul and innovation out of a ofrm of music and replacing it with overly polished production is not progress its just watering donw the music By the way Paul Okenfield is not the worlds' greatest dj he and his marketting team just claim he is!!! Larry Levan might be dead but you still cant run around calling yourself tha twhen you play watered down boring music with no balls calloway  anything on electrfounk, direct beat, metroplex, twilight 76, MAP, Pao Gao movement, UR, puzzle box etc whatever you do try some music with emotion instead\n\nAlsot heres nothing wrong with lot sof vocals the vocals are usually the best part of house music. check out changes by imaginatio,n move your body by marshal jefferson, or the goodlife by innercity, all classics and its the vocals that make all of them", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
{"reviewText": "\n\nAs one of the few GU albums that actually catpure the essence of the settin,g GU), the combined sound creates a unique ambience that enrtance sthe listener  For anyone in need of relaxation or something to listen to on their mp3-player during a day at the beach, thi salbum is pure bliss\n\nAs ofr comparison with GU009 andt he Northern Exposure setsthere's really no comparison!!!  It truly is a unique compilation which definitely sums up Sasha as the pioneer of the progressive sound", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
{"reviewText": " I gto suckered into htis one maybe my idea of unbelieavble trance sets must be different to the others here Thats my idea of good tranecand a live set he did for Gatecarsher / Radio one but this was far short of being, what I would describe as.\n 2stars coz 'Ive heard worse", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
{"reviewText": "Brilliance This CD compilation is remarkable in its ability ot capture so many moods at once vEeryone here has alraedy said it all, if you don't own this CD then there is no excuse for not buying it as soon as possible Yet once Sasha  hints at the fade into Orbita'ls \"Nohting Left\", you quickly get a picture of the brooding storm on the horizon The two tracks work so perfectly next to each other that it's scary how seamlessly your mood will transition, only and always for the better as Sasha rides the storm out for the rest of this great compilation mix", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
{"reviewText": "THE best mix I've heard What can be said tha twould do justice to the beauty to this album Words cannto describe the lush suondscapes of this installment of the infamous Global Underground series When you add GU with Sasha (whom I believe to be greater than Oakenfold for his brilliant and insightful track selections/sequencing and his unmatched mixing skills) magic is created This album is also pumped up with benefit of the BT songs \"Mecury & Solace\" and \"Fibonacci Sequence\"\nMy only criticism is the rough bump the flow encounters when Sasha mixes into his track \"Xpander\" (which is arguably THE best trance track in history of dance music) due to the uniqueness of the track and at no fault of his own If you are an anthem lover, this CD might disappoint you, stick with Trance Nation", "sentiment": "positive", "category": "{'typos', 'punct'}"}
