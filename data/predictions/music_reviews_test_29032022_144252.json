While I originally had apprehension buying the album Lay Down Thy Burdens- after listening to it once I am glad I bought it.\n\nViking\/Folk metal is awesome. It just is. It isn't everyone's cup of tea though. For example- the hard core black metal music is too much for me to handle because of the discord in the musical beat itself. I think the closest I've gotten to any of that would be Behemoth or Slayer (Slayer is not black metal).\n\nI didn't count the 2 quick wind instrument songs on this album in the scoring. There were two songs- Signal the Storm and Lay Down Thy Burdens that came out OK.- I really liked this album. Both of those songs were OK- just not enough to rank them any higher. I likes Warriors In Carrion Kingdoms, Wolf, Wisdom, Silence and Bow to None the best.\n\nI'll give this album a 4.2\/5.0 (84%). Definitely worth picking up if you like Viking\/Folk metal.
