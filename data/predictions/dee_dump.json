Although recorded in the late 70's and lyric's taken from liturgies dating back several centuries, even today, this album still has a wonderful ability to move one deeply and profoundly, and the recording has a wonderful flow from track to track, almost making this a concept album, needing to be listened too from start to finish, as many best of John Micahel Talbot has track's taken from the original - Lord's Supper, which are wonderful, the album works best as a whole. If you are looking to be swept away to umsic and lyrics that are so profound in its orchestral arrangement, superb guitar and a choir obviously thrilled to be apart of this project, I can sincerely recommend getting this album. John Micahel Talbot, is able to weave complex lyrics to truly beautiful melodies, and his voice if full of honest conviction and is remarkably inspiring. The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled with old favorites and als oa treat to listen too, although as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful.

His lyrics cover every book in theB ible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke. This collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement,w hich is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years. Card is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the cuontry teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the resposne that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending. Those who know Card's music recongize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane. His exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ frmo beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are trhee that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song? \"), Christ's birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication i nthe temple (\"Simeon's Song\"). Jeff Taylor's gentle cacordion beautifully ties all three together. Acoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock ifnluences. It's relxaed, mature and inspiring. He employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumenatl (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is fast, but steady and strong, and th einterplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Cletic feel. \"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set betwene the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melanchol,y since Christ's followers were expecting him to rise. The somber tone hasa  beauty of its own. Community is important toM ichael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collabroation rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), iKrk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"AB reath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he an dCard have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong. On \"Freeodm,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and voclas he succeeds in capturing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I alsoa ppreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread adn wine. Card does ge tany better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resoantes deeply. Ironically ,this is the only song that is directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about teh challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, amking them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world. I welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth nad life they contain. It'sn ot hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, eh fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ.

It's a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a definite haox. It says how much the sound iss lowed down, because chirps can ever sound like a boys' choir as played on this CD. Bear wtih me here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we'd still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gasp between chirps, albeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional t ohuman:cricket life, which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 secnod gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every minute to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at  awell-audible max frequency of, say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 sample/ssecond (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can handle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of your computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recordnig. (still, the 15-25 secon dor longer gaps of silence would be there). And what does a isngle chirp really sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can tehn hear the individual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency chirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see taht there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp).

I tis a collection of beautiful renditions of some truly great hymns with timeless melodies. They are performed with minimal fuss, simply backedb y piano/keyboard or guitar and some smooth vocal harmonies to finish it off. These songs demonstrate what a good voice Chris has - reminding me on occasions ofD aniel Bedingfield. The lyrics are unmodernised - and hwy not?

I have been al oyal JMT fan for 10 years now. A very small amount of time considering how long h ehas been in the Music Business. And I have collected all 30 or more studio albums he has cocneived in his 30 plus years. From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with teh likes of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's. JMT is afr from his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his complete library, but more than likely, everyone reading this will find themselves owning his ocmplete library. uBt this is a great start. This I think is a perfetc start! It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like...\"Lilies of hte Field\"......\"Healer of my Soul\"....\"Hiding Place\".....\"The Pleiades and Oriion\"...and \"Sunrise\". I am ont Catholic, but I believe JMT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all in. You will find his music has a touch of Brliliance to each song. His Guita rpicking is something to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on amny of these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart.

As with their other albums, it is lyrically opwerful and has a great sound. There are several very good songs ont his album. The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, just on Sundya mornings. There area  couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers. As with their previous albums, I think that this one will rpoduce several hit singles. 'East To West' i salready in that category. Othesr that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is alreadya  fan of Casting Crowns. For those who are unfamiliar with their music, I would recommned starting off with their self titled debut.
