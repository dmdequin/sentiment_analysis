Fact is, it is GREAT dance music, and takes such huge amounts of talent. Also, with the amount of samples Scooter uses, I have been introduced into whole new worlds of music from different styles. They know what they are doing!\n\nNow- Under The Radar Over The Top. All I have to say is... wow. What an album. At least 10 times better than Jumping All Over The World, which was damn good. So, I'll give a basic track breakdown.\n\nStealth- 8/10\nThis is just an intro track... very cool, some samples of Russian voices, etc, and then a sample which sounds a bit Sean Connery esque. Very cool intro.\n\nJ'adore Hardcore- 7/10\nThis was the first single from UTROTT. Albeit entertaining, this is one of the worse tracks on the album, simply because of how it matches up to the others. It's still a GREAT track, but nothing compared to the others on the album. Also, the \"Dup Dup\" vocals are getting a teensy bit old.\n\nTi Sento- 10/10\nWOW. What a track! Sampling the very talented Antolenna Ruggiero of Italy, Ti Sento is a beautiful track and semi-cover version of the same song by Matia Bazar. Very exhilarating track and the vocals are top notch. Incredible! Would give it over 10 if I could... really over the top!\n\nState of Mind- 9/10\nThis is where Scooter really starts to showcase that \"Hardstyle\" sound (Hardstyle is a fast type of electronic music with exhilarating melodies and faster beats with very cool synths.) This track has a great melody, great vocals, and is overall very enjoyable!\n\nWhere The Beats... - 10/10\nBy far my favorite track on the album. With an incredible melody sampled from the Italian artist Technoboy, Scooter for once uses the High Pitched Vocals in a beautiful way, making this track truly amazing. Great beat, great melody, I love this tune!\n\nBit A Bad Boy - 8/10\nThis is another good track. Not incredible, but still damn good. This song samples the intro from the SMD song \"Just Like You\", which in my opinion sounds a bit weird. In the original track, the opening is very emotional, but unfortunately Scooter used some sort of vocal filter and it sounds a bit off. Other than that, great melody and H.P. Baxxter's vocals are top notch again!\n\nThe Sound Above My Hair- 10/10\nAnother track that just makes you stop and go WOW. This was released as the 3rd single off the album, and in my opinion, the single version is better, but this version too is awesome. H.P. Baxxter actually sings for once, showing a whole new sound from Scooter. The track is very nostalgic, and has no leading synth, but that all leads to the charm and beauty of this track. This track also uses the infamous autotune effect, which has been overly criticized lately. However, tracks like this are the reason Autotune exists. Autotune was used simply for the robotic sound, making Baxxter sound great in this track.\n\nSee Your Smile- 8/10\nA very fun dance track, this track has a very cool melody and a good beat. The Jumping All Over The World esque high pitched vocals return, not as well performed as they are in Where The Beats... but are still fun. The track has a nice chord progression. It's a very happy track, and a very fun one.\n\nClic Clac- 9/10\nBack with the Hardstyle sound, Scooter makes an instrumental track that is very cool. Very interesting instrument progression, great dance song! Not much else to say, but a great track.\n\nSecond Skin- 9/10\nThis is a cover version of the New Wave song of the same name. It's a bit out of the spirit of the album, but it's a great track. How H.P. Baxxter sings in this track is great, there is no autotune, and it's a great synthpop track. Sounds like it came straight from the late 1980's, very interesting track!'\n\nStuck on Replay- 9/10\nYet another very happy track with a great synth line. The beat in the background is great for dancing, and the High Pitched Vocals are back, sampling a Lionel Ritchie song. Great song, and another very fun one.\n\nMetropolis- 10/10\nScooter finishes the album with \"Metropolis\", a very well thought out trance track. The track was inspired by a DJ the band bet on Ibiza, and it makes a great finish. Yet another instrumental spare for occasional operatic sampling... very very intense track. 10/10.\n\nTOTAL: 90/100\n\nConclusion- Great dance album that showcases European Electronic Music, and demonstrates that a great deal of work and thought go into the tracks. I strongly suggest you buy this, its an album that one can listen to over and over again.", "summary": "Awesome Rave/Dance/Hardstyle album", "unixReviewTime": 1259280000, "sentiment": "positive", "id": 99946, "vote": NaN, "image": NaN}

The name, taken from Marcel Duchamp's same titled painting, is a French expression in which the verb is missing (tu m'...). This literally translates to \"you [...] me\", where the missing verb must be provided by the viewer (of the painting), or, in this case, the listener. The album, released on Richard Chartier's LINE Records, features the first four (out of nine) audio compositions, created for \"two laptops, two mixing boards, two loudspeakers, one video projector, [and] one room.\" These pieces were recorded live at Vico Santa Chiara Studio, Citt Sant'Angelo, Italy in the summer of 2008. For the installation, the duo create an atmosphere where \"sound and light vibrations reverberate inside the room, blending together in an enveloping monochrome, that creates an atmosphere to be contemplated.\" The visuals, available as excerpts on the TU M's website, are composed of drawn out monochrome landscapes, resembling distant mountain silhouettes and sluggish geometric figures, visible in change and movement only through sporadic skipping through the captures. Attempting careful observation, or trying to make out patterns that are not there, is futile. It's like watching yourself age in the mirror. It's like watching the clouds... The audio compositions paint the same picture. Over a slight white noise hiss and endless loops, the melody swells in ambient waves of sound, sparkling in the light of distant piano notes. Like the waves of an ocean that have been crashing against this beach for thousands of years, and many years to come, this music is new and ancient - it exists _all_ the time, somewhere completely on its own, only to be summoned into this moment with the press of a button. The sounds fade in and out with the rhythm of my breathing. Inhale soft pads. Exhale minor chords. Let this pattern wash away all worries. And when the [almost] 30 minute track ends, the melody is still there, in the background of my mind. To round off this exploration of space, sound, and light, intertwined together to create this minimal composition, the duo includes a quote by Jean Cocteau: A poet always has too many words in his vocabulary, a painter too many colors on his palette, a musician too many notes on his keyboard. Check out previous numerous releases by TU M' by rummaging through their sound and visual works, carefully catalogued on their website. Their project under the name of Steno, for example, describing themselves as \"a world made up of second-hand music\", is released on their own, Mr. Mutt  label, which, not coincidentally, is the name Marcel Duchamp signed on the upside down urinal, and named his found art as Fountain.", "summary": "Headphone Commute Review", "unixReviewTime": 1271548800, "sentiment": "negative", "id": 99965, "vote": NaN, "image": NaN}

The songs here on the album have not really been the strongest of her career, and she hasn't had that chart-strength she had shown from her past, and that has sadly shown with other divas like Beyonce', Rihanna, and the dynamic return of Whitney Houston dominating the music scene. Mariah hasn't shown that well with her last single, her cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, which didn't even crack the Top 40. Now, her latest single, H.A.T.E.U., the third single from her album is very weak, and tries to bring in a more simplistic feeling to her voice. Unfortunately, I wasn't appealed into the song, and it wasn't like the ballads she used to score with like Dreamlover and Through The Rain. It really was one of the weaker tracks from the album. I think Mariah should really try harder to deliver a more wide-appealing album when she does get around to it, because she really took a huge tumble on Memoirs. Hopefully, she will and hard core fans will be awaiting something better than this.\n\nSong: D+", "summary": "Dragging Down", "unixReviewTime": 1259366400, "sentiment": "negative", "id": 99983, "vote": NaN, "image": NaN}
