"  T!!!  Whether it's the ""single"", 'Tearrdop', with Elizabeth Fraser's ethereal vocals, or the heavy-rock inflected 'Angel' and 'Dissolved Girl', or the epic show-stopper 'Group Four', Massive seems as a group with no limitations  And even rap-haters can appreciate 3-D's low key, almost whispered rhymes on 'Inertia Creeps' and 'Risingson'.  Tihs one is cna't-miss",positive,"{'typos', 'punct'}"
"THE EPITOME OF TRIP-HOP its just one of those cds that you don't grow tired of.with  beatiful singing around every bend,there are only two tracks where you get  an actual sense of rap on it which are risingson and inertia creeps and  both are absolutely amazing as well as the rest of the albumif you're new  to trip-hop or are just curious check this out you won't be  dissapointed-later.",positive,"{'typos', 'punct'}"

" This CD is marvellous Almost aynthing can de said abou tthis CD - but it really should be all positive ""Teardrop"" and ""Inertia Creeps"" are  nearly enough to make this a must buy in themselves, but really the entire  album is worth listening to There is no point in ravnig about this album's  brilliance, all you need to know is that you should listen repeatedlyt o  this album at the very least",positive,"{'typos', 'punct'}"

" (actually 2 1/2 stars) This album is just what you would expect, I suppose, from the author of Martha My Dear and Why Don't We Do It In The Road!!!McCartney has always been about having a goodt ime, best foot  forward and all that, and I'm sure that the idea at the time was to record  an upbeat, homey-sounding little record with off-the-cuff spontaneity  Well, sink me if that isn't what he did!!! The uncertainty is a bit palpable all over Wild Life;  Mumbo, for example, might have been a scorching rocker if Paulie had been  bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes; Dear Friend is a  conflicted counter-attack on Mr!!! Ono Lennon without a whole lot of  conviction; Paul comes across as hesitant ot really let loose on his  erstwhile bandmatewell, let's just say it lives up to it's  title.I mus tadmit at odd times, usually when in my cups, I'll go around  humming its absurdly catchy tune yLircs well,they're better than the ones  for MubmoI'll let it goa t that OK, I'm being a bit snide, I  know.again, some  second takes might have helped here!!!

"some of you dunces are on crack Okay some of you dunces, who said ""duhhrrr his tone is awful"" are total idiots, on this ablum, his guitar tone was probably his best, blended in well with the orchestra  If you like malmsteen you need to get this album don't get the US release, get the import and his attack album, because i'm sure you have his others!!!",positive,"{'typos', 'punct'}"
"Simply Amazing The first time I saw the name ""Concerto"" I was puzzled by what Malmsteen had done this time!!! This album was simply amazing, first off it is purely instrumental so don't expect any vocals from this one Imo I think thats good because I buy Malmsteen's albums purely just to hear what he plays!!! It starts off with a great beginning showing off what he has ocmposed This brilliant young man has composde all this I think that Malmsteen created this because he was finally trying to manifest his true desire I think he should ditch his whole metal type of music adn concentrate on this",positive,"{'typos', 'punct'}"

" Yngwie is a excellent rocke lectric guitar improviser, but for himself to pose as a classical composer is a insult to classical music As fort he playing itself Yngwie does a decent job, but if we are to compare him to the best classical musicians, this sounds sloppy with no dynamics!!!

"At least not all of it is cheesy I purchased this album as a devotee of their early, pre-top 40 albums, and was hoping that this would in some way tell the full story implied by songs on their greatest album, Secret Treatise  Unfortunatley, it doesn't actually tell the whole story, and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock  The album does provide an inteersting alternative realization of Astronomy (the climactic song on Secret Treaties), which was the one song I did add to my Tiunes library  However, the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album, also the album's title osng, and should be climactic, not an homage to 80's schlock; it reminds me of the theme song to the John Carpenter film Big Trouble in Little China, which played over the end credits of that film  In that spirit, I'd like to say that if you liked 70's and 80's art rock concpet albums, like the Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and the Imagination album by the Alan Parsons Project (which is the best example I can give of an album similar to this one), youm ay well like this album  Alternately, if you'd like to explore Blue Oyster Cult truly at their best, obtain and listen to their first three albums (Blue Oyster Cult, Tyranny and Mutation, and Secret Treaties) in order, and then you will get a sense of what I'd hope this album would be.",negative,"{'typos', 'punct'}"

"Annoying but effectvie I'm an SAT tutor and if you can stand to listen to Ms. Mazer's annoying voice and stories of her dating days, you will learn new words and her approach is effective. For some teenagers, Ms. Mazer is too much ot listen to--my son refuses. However, I've listened to all her CD's nad I've learned and remembered new words. I would suggets your borrow one CD from a friend and try it first before you buy it. Ms. Mazer's apporach is more effective than Princeton Reviews Word Smart and Word Smart II if you can tolerate her. If you are a parent who allows your children to awtch the Simpsons or South Park then you will find Ms. Mazar's stories equally crude.

"Gutter trsah. Well, this would certainly expand your vocabular.y Normally, one would associate the diea of increasing your vocabulary with lifting yourself to a higher level and communication on a level that is a bit more dignified.

Or if you are in high schoo lwith run away hormones and want to impress your friends in the bathroom go for it. In the first few minutes you'll learn about the word abash by association with phrases like ""if your fly is open and people can see your private parts"". After that you'll have other examples to help you learn words where the examples are things like a woman ""positng nude photos of her over weight husband on the internet.""

"In 2005 James Valliant wrote _The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics_ Up to that point, largely due to this movie and the Branden's two books, I accepted the assertion that sh eexhibited less-than-ideal behavior in her personal life, and possessed a rather difficult personality Fortunately, Mr. Valliatn's book, along with Marry Ann Sures'  _Facets of Ayn Rand_ ([...]) proved that Miss Rand was a far better person than represented by the Branden's books, and it was, in fact, the Brandens who were dishonest and manipulative If you decide to view this omvie, I would like to suggest you first read the above-mentioned books, in order to benefit from the scrupulous research of Mr. Valliant, as well as the personal and daily relationship between the Sures and Miss Rand If this movie was represented as pur efiction it might have some limited entertainment value, however since it portends to represent actual people and events, its distortions and errors earn it my lowest rating",negative,"typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"

"The 2-disc set documenting The Concert for New York City contains what appears to be music from a spectacular variety of acts; all liev and all carefully chosen by the artists to pay tribute to the fire and police corps who helped save lives in the wake of the 9-11 disaster in New York In fact, it is a night of mostly classicr ock for baby boomers I am n oyoungster myself, but David Bowie opening the show with a horrible version of Simon and Garfunkel's America sets the wrong tone for me The inexplicably deleted Macy Gray cover of With a Little Help From My Firends was much more interesting when I saw the show on TV Do not get me wrong - I have got a soft spot for a lot of these acts: James Taylor is always a delight and the response of the crowd upon hearing his soothing voice was sincerely moving, but thta drama does not come through on CD Not JTs' fault The good tracks are few - Jagger&  Richards' Salt of the Earth was a great choice Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer is nice even if it was also included on Tribut eto Heroes The 'to hell with everybody' tone of their toher two tunes almost negates Prayer's impact, though While Jay-Z and the Backstreet Boys sound like they were booked for the wrong benefit, Destiny's Child does Emotion better than the Bee Gees ever did, mostly because they are actually young women instead of aging men trying to sound like yuong women Five for Fighting also holdsi ts own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit Superman But John Rzeznick of Goo Goo Dolls had no voice to sing Iris, so it was left of the CDi n favor of the band's cover of Tom Petty's American Girl, which does not require as much pure voice Billy Joel was also not in the best vocal form, although his choice of Miami 2017 from his early catalo gwas eerie and bold Melissa Etheridge's live performancew as a technical nightmare that somehow the studio engineers managed to clean up But her two songs only prove what I have always thought about her: she rocks hard, but she is predictable and bornig Warning: TheW ho gets 25 minutes for three songs on this recording Atl east they are in fine form, though, especially Roger Daltrey whose voice seems to have had plenty of rest in recent years Paul McCartney, who planned teh evening, gets the last four songs to show how ragged his voice is these days",negative,"typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"

horrendous People fell in love with Steve Gaines because he played wtih a great band for a year and a half Steve Gaines became a household name because he first played with Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, the band and
because he wrotes ome with Ronnie Van Zant Steve was a good guitar player and he brougth a lot to Skynyrd Steve
expanded the range of Skynyrd fro a short time But tehn too so did Ed King whom Gaines replaced on guitar Skynyrd was alwaysb etter with three guitars The three guitar lineup fleshed Lynyrd Skynyrd into a rocka
nd roll contender Sure, Allen oCllins and Gary Rossington were great on guitar but something was still lacking The third guitarist fleshed out the band and cmopleted and complemented it Of the three Steve Gaines cds that were released commercially, all I can say of them si that they clearly show
a musician who was making some very non professional or novice music To my ears the music is mostly quite bda And of the choices for songs I can only ask where was this guyw as coming from Steve Gaines becam ean instant LEGEND because he DIED after a short tenure with Lynyrd Skynyrd In that shrot
period the man thrilled us by being at his peronal BEST He wrote and snag ""As not No Good Life LEGNED, the
Skynyrd album of 1987 introduced us to Steve's song ""One in the Sun"", which is another decent Skynyrd song Steve
also wrote ""I Know A Little"", and he was involved somehow in ""oYu Got That Right"" and ""I Never Dreamed This
wsa Steve Gaines at the HEIGHT of his professional career Now forget about the hsort Skynyrd tenure and you have a man playing what, The Holiday Inn or some bar Ronnie
and Skynyrd RESCUED Steve Gaines from complete OBSUCRITY And let me say that Steve Gaines served Ronnie well
in  atime when he had writer's block Ronnie was somewhat xehausted musically when Steve joined the band Ronnie
wsa the heart and soul of the band Ronnie was the ledaer Stev ebrought some personal MATURITY to the band Steve
helped with some ovcals and gave Ronnie the ONLY REST he ever got on vocals However,a ll three of Steve's albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what Lynyrd Skynyrd did
for Steve Gaines Steve may never havem ade it without Skynyrd From what I hear of Steve's music I feel the manp

"First, I would like to say that if you have not had the pleasure of listening to this artist than you should take the opporutnity and do that right now Her voice iwll take you by total surprise, she has a deep rich voice that will just melt your heart upon listening to it, and if you add that with thoughtful introspective lyrics and the right arrangement you have a well-crafted masterpiece Second, I would like to say tha tsimply Susie Suh is an artist that stands on her own The comparisons that I have read in others' rveiew is not quite doing this artist justice She is nuigue in the way that Sade is unique She has that breathy quality to her voice that evokes emotion without sounding rehearsed or planend She is unique in the way that Bjork is unique because you cannot see anyone else singing those songs but her because anything esle would not measure up and would not be genuine Finally I would like to comment on the cover of this album ismply because I think that her label is doing it right The front cover is just the image of the side prfoile of a woman The listener can just listen to the music and not judge her on what they think she hsould sound like because she is of an asian backround If there is one thing that I can stress is that you will mis sout on hearing a great singer if you go in with a preconcieved idea of what someone should sound like because the person singing does not quite match the voice",positive,"typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"

"Perhaps because it is only the soundtrack to Joseph Losey's flim of the opera, this Don Giovanni has never come into its own The acst is the best on records, barring only EMI's classic set under Giulini It was prescient of Maazel to gather up young singers who would soon be major stars like Te Kanawa--gorgeous as Donna Elvira--and Eda Moser, who is dramatically intense as Donna Anna, despite some pitch probelms Ruggero Raimondi as a suave Don and Jose Van Dam as a bitter, insidious eLporello are quite fine, as is Teresa Berganza as Zerlina Only the wobbly Kenneth Riegel disappoints as Don Ottavio, but hardly anyone succeeds vocally ni the fiendish arias assigned to him Maazel pulls no pervrese punches He is mostly straighftorward, although at times he takes pains to underline the drama for the camera, which is all to the good From the fierce opening scene you would thnik this was going to be an angry, thuggish Don (I wish it had been), but soon Raimondi lapses into smooth, somewhat bland singing that emphasizes mellifluous tone over character Too bad, sicne everything else is outstanding Sony's sonics are fine, and the orchestra plays ver ywell In sum, this almost great Don Giovanni deserves a lisetn It is among the best on hte market, lacking only a charismatic Don to rise to the very top If you object to Wachter's brutishness on the Giulini set or dislike the gloss of Karajan's conducting on the stary DG set, this one from Maazel may turn inot a first choice",positive,"typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"

"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with ad rawing of her Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that ahs a red cover I do not know why the decision wsa to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, EDEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on he r1st album It is what this album should have contained more of - original umsic As for the other 5 songs, I guess sicne HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo It is far too many to have odne Waht should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career This easily could have been an EP, and probably shuold have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes Of these  ICAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best The arrangements are at least new & idfferent than the original versions But really, how could she otp the original versions It is a case ofo verdoing it Even the presecne of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs does not add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men I once read that there were more recordings don efor her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this Grav eerror This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her s1t And why name it OBNNIE POINTER like the 1st Al lit has done is confuse people So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you will lik ethis Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - i tIS amazing Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGH,T in 1984 for the Private I label That is better tahn this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of iht singles and albums A shame she will not be let back into the group ,but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group Relaesed in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover Songs: I Cannot HELP MYSELF, JIMMYM ACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN",negative,"typos, expand contractions, remove punctuation"
