"Out like a light! My dentist recommended this as a relaxation technique for dental visits. They give me an ipod with headphones, play this on it and it relieves some of the stress of dental treatment, which I dislike intensely.
It worked so well that I bought my own copy to try at home. I fall asleep after a couple of minutes and stay asleep. Instead of tossing and turning, I hardly move at all. Highly recommend.",1
"Disappointed I am personally acquainted with a member of this group and I love his music, but unfortunately, despite his efforts and talent which are not well exhibited herein, are for naught.  The lyrics are often unintelligible, the melodies are boring and repetitious, and the recording quality is marginal.

"Corrupt File Didn't Work I purchased this album to help me sleep after we had to take the air conditioner out of the window, unfortunately this file only plays 39.55 minutes out of the 105 minutes it's supposed to play, cutting off suddenly and distractingly. I have contacted Amazon regarding this, they made the download available to me again; I followed their instructions clearing my cache, uninstalling their downloader, and restarting my computer, but the file still has the same problem. It's evident that the file they have is just plain corrupt. I've requested a refund, but have heard nothing back. Don't buy this CD!

Five Stars good,1
"NO GOLD for RAINBOW ""Rainbow"" was a hard album for me to review. I love Johnny Cash, and to give anything that he has done less than 4 stars is tough for me. ""Rainbow"" was released in 1985 and was Cash's last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with ""Always on my Mind."" However, this pairing doesn't work as well.  The material is weak and some quite ill-suited for Cash. ""Easy Street"" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire who's having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On ""Love Me Like You Used To"" Cash sounds as bored singing it as I did listening to it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener ""I'm Leaving Now"" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about ""The System"" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson's ""Here Comes That Rainbow Again"" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's cover of CCR's ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" stands out also. This was the last digital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.",0
"the Album that made Columbia records dump the man in Black This was the very last original album from Johnny Cash to be released on Columbia records, after you listen to it you'll see why. A few good gems are on this, like his version of the CCR classic ""Have you ever seen the rain?"" but all in all this album is just lame. BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercury records and made 5....yes 5 totally awesome CDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releases......1. Johnny cash is coming to Town....2. Water from the Wells of Home....3. Classic Cash '88 (re-recordings of his big hits)....4. Boom-chicka-Boom.....5. The Mystery of Life.",0
"Great Battlefield series medley! I thoroughly enjoyed the Battlefield rendition of the series' many games' different themes. Battlefield 2 and Bad Company being the most prominent, the sequences are very well integrated and recording quality is amazing.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section of percussion only, about halfway through the song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were trying to do. I then figured that it was probably their attempt at the Battlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no, it's not. The album came out even before Bad Company 2 did... It doesn't ruin the overall experience entirely, but it was something that bothered me that I thought was worth noting. Otherwise, it's a great piece!",1
"Awful I had the displeasure of listening to this song while listening to Lex and Terry. They had the singer on, Josie, interviewing him and whatnot over the phone, then they played this song. Horrible horrible song. Repetitive, generic, corporate metal? Can I even call it metal? Terrible song.",0

"Amazon download service is terribly disappointing The story itself is great. I have heard it before. But I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's ""download"" service. I thought I would end lp with an MP3 download that I could put on CD and listen to in the card. But instead I get a sort of referral to a website where I can hear the show but I cannot save it to my computer and put it on CD. I specifically downloaded this show to listen to on a trip I will be taking in the car. I will definitely not be buying any more ""downloads"" from Amazon.",0

"Not a bad offering If you love Jo Dee Messina- buy this cd.  Simply for the fact that it's new music from her and she is a fantastic singer and artist.  As a stand alone cd, it's not bad.  Probably the weakest of the ""Unmistakable"" trilogy in my opinion, but still with some good points.  ""Heaven was Needing a Hero"" and ""Get up Again"" are both great songs, with ""Get Up Again"" a throwback to an ""I'm Alright"" life is good anthem song. ""I like Me"" has promise but it's a bit all over the place.  ""How do you get High"" isn't as scandalous as it sounds, in fact, it really doesn't say anything as a song.  People get their fixes from different places.  Okay.  So..... ""Keep the Faith"" is a great song but was already listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  ""That's God"" is well-written but not a radio hit.  As a whole, not a bad cd, but nothing you want to sing out loud and jam to in the car.  But new music from Jo Dee Messina after waiting for five years is truly priceless....",0
"60 SUPER EXITOS LOS RANCHERITOS DEL TOPO CHICO This CD brought back lots of good memories of the music of 60's & 70's.

"RELAXING? MOSTLY. BORING? SOMETIMES. WORTH BUYING? YES! I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) because I love some of Joe Hisaishi's music from watching a few of Miyazaki's cartoons.  I am not an anime fanatic, nor do I fall in love with every Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fall helplessly in love with it, or I just plain find it boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD, because I know how hard it is to perform, especially when you are in a studio and you are aware of all your mistakes.  This player is good, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight reading all of these pieces, which is a talent to be sure.  Unfortunately the playing comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Either way, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called ""Kaze-No Toori Michi"" or ""The Wind's Path.""  This arrangement, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is absolutely gorgeous!!  Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the components of the original score, use lush exotic harmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductory repetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undercurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe just expressing the unbiased non-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I don't know, but it reminds me of what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, but I believe it would sound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechanical.  Regardless, I did give it 5 stars because it has many redeeming qualities.",1
"Beautiful Instrumental Soundtrack Beautiful soundtrack. Great for background music during activities like office work, homework, yoga, etc.",1

"Caters to hipsters and Florence and the Machine fans A decent album, somewhat mediocre. Nothing special really stood out, they may be good live. Also reminds me of Sheryl crow. Not great, not bad, not memorable. You might really like it if you're not exposed to much music, maybe buyers of 2 CDs a year.",0
"Pleasant but boring I bought ZERO because I loved the Taller Children album and the MP3 download was only $5.
Sampled the songs and wasn't impressed but I thought that after I listened a little more it would grow on me. Nope.
Basically the album is boring/monotonous. Her voice is still wonderful but stays within a narrow range. The music is also uninspired.
I miss the playfulness of Taller Children, the chills that Right Next To You created.",0

And searching for that phrase led me, without further ado, to the album, ""Game Called Life"" by Leftover Cuties.  Then it was a snap to find the album for sale in digital form at Amazon.com and purchased and downloaded it.  It's their own brand of jazz and I love it.  Makes me imagine the prohibition days and the charleston days.  And a cover of a Lady Gaga song!  With Leftover Cuties I've been enchanted and captivated by a female vocalist that breathed new life into songs like You Are My Sunshine and the very talented musicians that together form this incredible band.

I have verified that the sound is NOT present on the same tracks from other sources.  Not sure what to make of this glitch?",0
"Say it Ain't so Joe I guess I was expecting something different based on what I hear from him on the airwaves. Thiis collection of songs is chosen by Satriani as a sample of his favorites. To me a lot of it sounds the same. He is obviously a virtuoso guitar player, but the sound gets redundant. Lots of music here.",0

"A Good Song about Empowerment This is a very catchy and inspirational tune on what it means to be self-reliant. I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as ""the shoes on my feet, I bought it"", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and/or any music from Destiny's Child.",1

"All Pomp and No Circumstance Where do I begin?
First off, I really, really, really wanted to like this album. After reading the stories and reviews I figured this was right up my alley. As a lover of all things pop and bubblegum, I thought this would be on an equal plane of the best Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co, Association, Archies, Patridge Family all rolled into one.
Alas, it is not to be.
There is nothing memorable here, nothing that will leave you humming the rest of the day. No hit singles to speak of. I've heard this was one of the most expensive albums made at the time. I think they tried and tried and tinkered over and over to perfect the sound and come up with a hit to no avail. The sound is fine, I have it on 180 gram vinyl. It's just the songs. They just sit there, with all their little background noises.
The only song I actually like is I'm With You. It sounds like the aforementioned Association crossed with The Partridge Family.
I've tried playing it over and over but nothing sticks. Not the song titles and not the cold, sterile tunes themselves.
It sounds bright and sunny but is hollow and empty beneath.",0

The pitch is noticeably lower and the tracks all run longer. ""Love Letters in the Sand"", for example, runs to 2'12"", not the 2'25"" Amazon claims. ""April Love"" lasts 2'39"", not 2'54"" - yes, that's how big the difference is. As the last reviewers says, if you're buying the CD, make sure it sounds better than these downloads.

"How Slow Can You Go, Volume 2 This CD is a British London Records version of the original mono ""Pat's Great Hits"" with 2 bonus tracks added - ""When The Swallows Come Back to Capistrano"" and ""Louella"". I used to have that LP, and the speed was quite correct. However, at least the Mp3 samples here at Amazon are awfully slow. So, before buying the CD, make sure it sounds at normal speed.  You can also look for the ""Greatest Hits"" CD which contains 8 original mono tracks from ""Pat's Great Hits"" plus other great songs. As for myself, I made a CDR compilation of all Pat Boone main original Dot Records albums from 2 box sets of the Bear Family ""Pat Boone, The 50's Complete"" and ""The Sixties, 1960-1962"".",0
"How Slow Can You Go? Pat was a pretty good singer in his day, and he made some really nice recordings.  But these downloads will need a little work to adjust the speed at which they play.  The Audacity program (free) should help bring the speed up to normal, but why should one have to jump through all those hoops?  At least these recordings are the orginal hits, and not Pat's absolutely HORRID re-recordings after his voice had really gone down the dumper.  It's very appropriate that ""Speedy Gonzales"" is not a part this set. I'd keep searching for something else if you don't want to run these tracks through an audio editor in order to make them listenable.",0

"Don't bother looking for the ""description"". You'll have to buy this to know what's in it. More than that, you'll have to buy it AND LISTEN TO IT to know what's in it. That's because there is no track list anywhere, not in the Amazon pages and not in the downloaded product. I know. I bought it thinking that the track list would surely appear in the downloaded clip. Wrong! All that you'll see there are the same misleading words that you see on Amazon's pages: ""See description for track details"". Fix this, Amazon. This is absurd. Why hide the track information from prospective buyers?",0
"Energizing and fun music I wake up in the middle of the night and put on public television to help me fall back to sleep - and that is where I first heard these guys.  They were so good, they woke me up!  Of course, I looked for their music on Amazon which is much less expensive than buying the premium packages on public tv.  I have both their cds.  I play them in my car and copied them onto my iphone. I also play the cd as background music when I have guests.  Their music is versatile and cheerful and energizing.  I really like the combination of piano and strings.  Their pieces include original music and variations of songs you'll recognize.  I like them enough that I am going to see them when they play in my area in the fall.  Enjoyable.  Upbeat.  Fun.",1
"Love the idea of this cd Love the idea of this cd. But it's hard to understand the singers... Even after reading the lyrics I had a hard time picking out the names of the presidents and their wives in the songs... They should've slowed it down and made it more clear, and it may confuse some kids since a lot of the names are run the names together.",0
"Excellent Educational Tool Bought this for our 4 year old because it was recommended by her school. This CD stays on rotation in the car and is a popular request. Its very repetitive which I feel lends to increased memorization. Quite frankly, it drives me crazy, but she's committing the presidents to memory and she's four...I think I can deal with that!",1
"SUNG IN ENGLISH, NOT IN THE ORIGINAL GERMAN !!! Listening to Bach cantatas sung in English is extremely annoying to me.  They should be sung in the original language which Bach intended.

"This is a good album if you want to get 3/4s of the ... I owned this album which I bought when I was a kid on LP.

Ragtime Special Volume 1 has sides A and C but for side C the titles of the songs are from side B.  (Got that?)  Volume 2 has side B but the titles are from side C.  I don't know what happened to side D.  Check out track 6 here ""Poor Butterfly"".  That's not it.  No idea how to contact Amazon support.  This is a good pair of albums if you want to get 3/4s of the songs and you're willing to rename them.",0
"Beautiful Music Marred By Muffled Sound Vocalion is a pretty neat label. They're re-issuing and rescuing some great tunes from the vinyl graveyard. I own several of their CDs. Love the music on this one, but it's got a very muffled sound. The volume setting is out of line with other songs in my WMP ""playlists"". So I have go turn up the volume then quickly turn it down again when the song is over. Be easier to nix it from my playlists, but then I'd never hear it.",0

"A Member Of The Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame Deserves A Best of CD When I first saw the February 2013 CD release by Real Gone Music titled Beautiful People I thought, at last, a comprehensive compilation covering multiple award-winning Country singer/songwriter Kenny O'Dell, who had 6 Country charters and two on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 from 1967 to 1979. However, the 18-track CD instead offers the 11 sides from his 1967 LP ""Beautiful People"" (Vegas VS-401) together with 7 bonus track from his Vegas/White Whale output. The good news for hits collectors is that you will get all four sides of his two Pop entries - Beautiful People - # 38 Hot 100 in November/December 1967 on Vegas 718 b/w Flower Girl, and Springfield Plane - # 94 Hot 100 in February 1968 on Vegas 722 b/w I'm Gonna Take It.

So, it looks like we're going to have to wait longer for a CD containing these 6 Country hits: You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love - # 58 March 1974 - Capricorn 0038 b/w Let's Go Find Some Country Music; Soulful Woman - # 18 Jan/Feb 1975 - Capricorn 0219 b/w Let's Get On The Road; My Honky Tonk Ways - # 37 Country and # 105 Hot 100 Bubble Under June 1975 - Capricorn 0233 b/w Behind Closed Doors; Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin' - # 9 July/Aug 1978 - Capricorn 0301 b/w We Might Be All Nite; As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms - # 12 Dec 1978 - Capricorn 0309 b/w Soulful Woman (re-issue); and Medicine Woman - # 32 April 1979 - Capricorn 0317 b/w Who Do I Know In Denver?

Some of the foregoing appeared in this 1974 LP ""Kenny O'Dell (Capricorn CP-0140) which contains: A1. Soulful Woman; A2. Everything I Am; A3. I'll Find Another Way (To Say I Love You); A4. Lord, Am I Dreamin'?; A5. Let's Get On The Road; A6. Easy Street; B1. Behind Closed Doors; B2. House Of Love; B3. Let's Go Find Some Country Music; B4. I Take It On Home; B5. You Bet Your Sweet, Sweet Love, and in his 1978 album ""Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'"" (Capricorn CPN-0211) which offers: A1. Let's Shake Hands And Come Out Lovin'; A2. We Can Make Music; A3. When It's Just You And Me; A4. Soulful Woman; A5. Behind Closed Doors; B1. Who Do I Know In Denver?; B2. As Long As I Can Wake Up In Your Arms; B3. We Might Be All Night; B4. Thank You Everlovin'; B5. I Take It On Home.

All we need is for some distributor to pull the different sides in these two LPs together with a bonus track to include My Honky Tonk Ways. That's the very least they could do to honour the writer inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame for writing such gems as Behind Closed Doors, a mega-hit for Charlie Rich, The Judd's Mama He's Crazy, and Loretta Lynn's Trouble in Paradise, just to name a few.",1

"Your Hands Woven Into Mine Liz Longley is a Pennsylvania native who studied voice at Berklee College of Music in Boston.  She has a great voice, expressive and conveying strong emotion.  ""High Loose Wire"" is her sophomore set.

I was sound asleep as you drove my car away.  About a hundred miles south of where we were going, I was stuck in a stale motel just cursing your name.""  ""Goodbye Love"" slows the pace with Liz's vocals conveying hurt as a result of romantic betrayal, ""There's a place our love remains, it's captured in time; It's still sitting by the river, your hands woven into mine.""  This is a really beautiful song.  Longley also includes two covers.  Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" and Joni Mitchell's ""River"" both are given exceptional treatments.

"Why No CD Conversion Of This Classic Christmas Album From 1958? It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.

Over the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148/25148), with a glossy front cover, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white on a green background and gold-embossed ""Christmas Carols"" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the ""Dot"" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, ""Billy Vaughn"" in white and ""Christmas Carols"" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.

Some of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.

Why that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.

In the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).

A great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?",1
"No Billy Vaughn Christmas Carols CD?? What's The Problem? I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly. But my surprise at some of the ones overlooked now has a Number 1 in my book: Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.

"""Good singer- But where's her only Hit "" Funny, I've seen two different collections from Jill Corey and both are missing the only hit she had.

Jill is best at upbeat songs,this CD is half and half, I don't care for the slow stuff, but this was the way the original was released. However by omitting that one song, which was a Huge hit, this CD is just missing a spark.",1

The sound quality of that album on this disc is terrible, and the first few beats of the first song are missing.  'Escape' sounds a little better; I suspect a digital master was already available for it.  The print quality of the insert is also very bad.

"Wonderful collaboration This album was made in 1958, containing some of my favorite Monk tunes, all of which was played with the energy and musicianship that would have done a live performance credit.

Personnel on this session were:  Monk and Blakey on piano and drums, respectively, Bill Hardman on trumpet, the great Johnny Griffin on tenor saxophone and Spanky DeBrest on bass.

This is the original version of the album (in 1999 a reissue album added alternate takes of Evidence, Blue Monk and I Mean You. Personally, I prefer this original version, and sincerely believe that the renditions on this album of what are some of Monk's best compositions are among the best ever recorded in a studio. If you are strictly a Jazz Messenger fan, this is a good addition to your collection. If you are a Monk fan I recommend grabbing it.",1

"The Trio's second album - and a great one at that This was the Ramsey Lewis Trio's second album, recorded in Chicago in 1958 for Argo and released on a 10"" platter as catalog number LP 627. This was a follow-on to their inaugural album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramsey-Lewis-And-His-Gentlemen-Of-Swing/dp/B004ADV5V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramsey Lewis And His Gentlemen Of Swing</a>, and was originally marketed as Volume 2.

Trivia is fun, but the proof is in the music and this page has sound samples. Each track is clear and whoever did the remastering and mixing did a great job to my ears. You can clearly hear every note, with Eldee Young's bass perfectly in the mix, and Red Holt's exceptional brushwork and drumming coming in crystal clear. I've used this album and its companion as both a study aid and a play-along for getting my own brush chops up to a higher level.

However you do not need to be a musician to enjoy this album. I will be honest and proffer an opinion that the music is competent and enjoyable, but not particularly exceptional.

That's not to say that the trio were not in top form - they were - and they were all virtuoso artists on their instruments. In fact Young was a master on cello (although not on this album) and all three were thoroughly grounded in music theory. However on this album they were just another very good jazz piano trio in a land filled with them. The main value of this album is the glimpse it provides into the trio's early years. That allows we fans to understand the foundation of the powerhouse trio they would become. As they drifted into pop and other forms of music their musical integrity would be called into question by the purists. This album proves otherwise.",1

"Essential, Classic American power metal Imagine: Guitars that blaze with no reserve, while at the same time keeping the good riffs alive. Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think ""80's!"" and throw up the horns instinctively....
These things were part of a style of metal that's now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior's debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There'll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no 'artful' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.
Although there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn't seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal ('You try so hard to be like everyone else'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra's signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song amazing on it's own, but there's also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band's lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, 'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, you're living a dream'. Yes, there's no questioning that it was 1988...
Going back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by 'general' vocalizations, like a 'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra's huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that's not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there's double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album's charm depending on your opinion.
The rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there's still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.
Rebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There's nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that's what Sacred Warrior plays best.",1

"Defective Audio FYI... The audio samples for this product are incorrect do not correctly represent this recording. These audio samples are running about 10% slower than they should be.

"Love song from great great grandma suffering from dementia I know my ""helpful"" rating will suffer from the title ... but come on .. you know it is accurate.  After first listen I thought this song was creepy. Next listen and I was thinking more comical.  Third listen and yeahhhhh it's kinda creepy, and that is without even looking at the cover art.  Decrepit lady sings of a lost distant love over a simple repeated guitar line, but toward the end a nice chorus of background angels come in to somewhat rescue this song.",0

If you love Cee Lo like I do, BUY THIS NOW!",1
"Lady Killer is not a Killer Song Cee-Lo is a bit of an odd character. He starts off the song with a monologue about how unique he is and lives by no rules. Then he moves into the meat of the song.

You shoudl take a listen to the preview and see what you think but I just don't think it is that good.",0
"Jack Miller get's back to his R&B Roots. This collection of original tunes shows just what an exception singer / songwriter Jack Miller is. The performances are nothing less than stellar recorded with some of Jamaica, California and Hawaii's finest musicians. Featuring rhythm aces Sly & Robbie on the title track with Nick Manson/piano, Andy Suzuki/horns, Glen Goto/keys and Bonnie Bowers/backing vocals. Multi-instrumentalist Reggae Griffin's production shines through out.  Miller has always been hard to 'put in a musical bag' mixing up jazzy R&B with Reggae.

"DO NOT BUY THIS  --  IT'S REALLY AWFUL! Bought Mp3 June 2016 (H. Winterhalter Goes Latin-RED cover-Hallmark label)  DO NOT BUY THIS DOWNLOAD!!! It is an insult to the talent of Mr. Winterhalter and the RCA Living Stereo technology which produced & issued this wonderful music 50+ years ago.  This download is made from an old scratchY LP and sounds A W F U L!  It sounds like it is in monaural, depriving the listener of the full, wide-spectrum sound the RCA LIVING STEREO line was known for.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

On the other side of the coin is that there are other Hugo Winterhalter  Mp3 collections containing the same songs currently available through Amazon. I will be investigating those other versions of this GREAT music and will post my findings here. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION....YOU WON'T BE HAPPY.

P.S. There are many reviews @ Amazon regarding these downloads. Unfortunately, it's impossible to know which reviews refer to which edition of this music. The ""DO NOT BUY"" version I'm speaking about was made available in 2009. There is a new issue from 2015 showing Mr. Winterhalter's face on a green background. Hopefully it's improved. That's my next attempt to get a clean copy of this music. I'll keep you informed, but............
--------------------------------------DON'T BUY THE ONE WITH THE RED COVER---------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE AS OF JULY 12, 2016.

I promised to get back to review ANOTHER mp3 of the same songs by Hugo Winterhalter, this time the one with the GREEN COVER and Hugo's face on that cover. Although these ARE NOT THE SAME RECORDINGS AS ON THE ORIGINAL LP WITH THE RED COVER, they are a huge improvement over the mp3 reviewed above. These recordings are in true stereo, have been ""cleaned up"", and sound good! Also, this download is a buck cheaper that the AWFUL ONE WITH THE RED COVER. If you want good versions of these terrific latin tunes, go for this one, you will not be disappointed, even though the recordings are NOT the same versions on the original RCA Hugo Winterhalter Goes Latin, which I encourage you to avoid on mp3.",0

"Bad Got this CD set as an x-mas gift for our 2 yr old who loves Disney. The songs are bad renditions of actual Disney songs. The recording quality is horrible. You can hear mistakes in the singing and yet they were too lazy to start over and just put the CD out mistakes and all. The songs are also just snippets of the song. There are no full versions. What a waste of $$$$. Between the vocal mistakes, amateur vocals, and lazy recording techniques this CD falls short of a professional, acceptable CD set. Shame on this Orchestra for having such low standards and shame on Hallmark records for releasing this.",0
are u crazy? Lower the price of this cd! This is and should be considered price gouging! Whether or not a cd is an import or not...nobody should have to pay this price for it!,0
"Extremely disappointing Iconic cover is about the best thing about this album. San Quentin is great, but the prisoners call for an encore and Johnny obliges, but why put it on the album? Has this ever happened before or since? I kept thinking 'maybe a riot will break out or someone will get shivved mid-song' but no, it is virtually the same. If I were locked up in San Quentin for twenty to life then I would happily sit through it forty times, but on my record player if and when I want an encore I can just lift the tonearm back a quarter inch. The version of Folsom Prison Blues is basically just Johnny thanking everyone then he sings the chorus once then leaves the stage. Ripped off - one of my favourites. Instead of San Quentin twice, Folsom once would have been great.

Ok rereading that now, ""extremely disappointing"" is too harsh, the versions of ""Walk the Line"" and ""Boy Named Sue"" and ""San Quentin"" Version No. 1 are must haves. ""Annoying"" is more accurate.",0

"An early 1980's Contemporary Christian album. Don Francisco is a wonderful song writer and singer. I call him a Christian folk rocker. His theology is correct, not ""off the wall"" like some Christian artists. This 1981 album, which I downloaded from his website, had many great songs on it about Christian life. As Amazon doesn't list them, I will.

1. Too Small a Price/Joy. A joyful song about the moment Christ appeared in heaven after the resurrection.
2. Since I Met Him. A song about the blind man Christ healed and his reaction to the healing in front of the Pharisees.
3. The Lord and I Together. An upbeat song about walking with the Lord through the day.
4. Beautiful to Me. A song about Jesus defending the woman who washed His feet in Simon the Pharisee's home.
5. If You Ain't Gonna Sing the Gospel. A song about performers who are troubled in their performances. ""If you ain't gonna sing the gospel, you're gonna sing the blues.""
6. Messengers from Heaven. A political song about the US not paying as much attention to God as it used to.
7. The Package. A humorous song about a package from the devil, a package which contained stuff the God would never send to his people. The end, which I won't give away, makes me LOL.
8. You Can't Take It With You. A song that reminds us that what the material possessions we accumulate on earth, stay on earth, that only the things that go with us are those things which are spiritual.
9. Give Your Heart a Home. My favorite song on the album, a song which reminds us that our plastic smiles and faces hide what we really need.
10. The Traveler/Joy. A song about the disciples when Jesus appeared to them after the resurrection.",1
"This is RCA VICTOR's ""Stereo Orthophonic"" High Fidelity This mp3 download is of the original 1958 RCA VICTOR LP.

.
As far back as 1953, RCA VICTOR experimented with two track recordings. Starting in '55, this company issued a series of stereo reel tapes and when Westrex developed a practical system for stereo LPs a couple of years later, RCA got into this format in a big way. In 1958, their first full year of LIVING STEREO album production, they issued about 200 titles. BOB AND RAY THROW A STEREO SPECTACULAR (LSP-1773) is one of these pioneering records.

It's really a chance for the label to demo this new process and offer samples of their growing stereo catalog. Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding's bits sprinkled throughout the program are excuses for various sound effects. On these segments, cross-channel panning is used to simulate movement across the sound stage. Stereo was a novelty that year, so the wider the spacial effect, the bigger the ""wow!"" factor.

RANDOM NOTES
On ""B & R at the Castle"" we meet hunchbacked 'Gore' (Bob as Karloff) and 'Dr. Akhbar' (Bob doing Peter Lorre). He's Director of Bob and Ray Scientific Research and we're first shown Dr. A.'s experimental fly, 'Neil.'

The ""Minuet on the Rocks"" excerpt is boogiefied Paderewski, with Skitch pounding away at a honky tonk piano. Behind the creaky door of ""The Round Room  is a bagpipe marching band. Besides many unusual percussion instruments in the Schory's ""Buck Dance,"" we also hear tap shoes. Lena's ""New-Fangled Tango"" is a mono 'live' at the Waldorf performance that has the audience giggling. Within the ballroom on ""The Thing"" is a clock with a screaming human pendulum. ""Second Hungarian Rhapsody"" is an edited version of one of the most insane oompah band recordings ever made.

Richard Leibert was Radio City's first-ever organist. His high output holiday song at the keys really gives your speakers a workout. If ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" sounds like Glenn Miller, there's a good reason. Several Miller alumni play on this recreation of the original Bill Finegan arrangement. The experiments in Dr. A.'s ""Laboratory"" are samples from RCA's sound effects library.

Xavier's Cugat's fourth wife, Abbe Lane (""Whatever Lola Wants"") is a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, born Abigail Lassman in 1932. ""The Ox Drivers"" reflects a popular trend of that day, folk music. Album-closing ""The End"" has shrunk-in-size Bob and Ray as the mad doctor's final experiment.

"An essential Glen Campbell obscure 45 singles repackage on a junk label This album, Pickwick SPC 3274 from early-mid 1971 or so, is a gem of early Glen Campbell Capitol 45 singles' stiffs that pre-date his GENTLE ON MY MIND period.  Songs:

Only the Lonely -- from 45 Capitol 5773 matrix 56567 recorded 9/12/66
Same Old Places -- from 45 Capitol 5037 matrix 50076
Woman's World -- from 45 Capitol 5360 matrix 50092
Heartaches Can Be Fun -- from 45 Capitol 5279 matrix 52773
Let Me Tell You 'Bout Mary -- from 45 Capitol 5172 matrix 50074
Through the Eyes of a Child -- from 45 Capitol 5172 matrix 51163
That's All Right -- from 45 Capitol 5441 matrix 50078 alternate take
Prima Donna -- from 45 Capitol 4925 matrix 38275 recorded 9/11/62
Can't You See I'm Tryin' -- from 45 Capitol 5638 matrix 55467

To put these in perspective, Capitol 5441's 45 A-side was the Brian Wilson/Beach Boys production, ""Guess I'm Dumb,"" Capitol 5504 45 record was GC's ""Universal Soldier"" pop hit in '65, and his first C&W hit with Al DeLory producing was ""Burning Bridges"" on 45 single Capitol 5773.  ""Gentle On My Mind"" was later on Capitol 5939 45 single, which dates July, 1967.  The songs on this Lp, too, are the stereo versions, while the 45s were issued in mono.  If it counts for anything with these el cheapo junk bin parent bait (If you were a kid in the '60s, nagged your parents to bring home that new Beach Boys Capitol Records album, your cheap sneaky parents might go to the Woolworth's el cheapo bin instead and buy that wretched THE SURFSIDERS PLAY THE BEACH BOYS SONGBOOK junker on Design Records, instead of the real thing.  Parent bait.  So BAD it sounded like your parents bought guitars and recorded it in their garage, all in one botched take.  That BAD.), the ""original"" issue of this Pickwick album was pressed on a silver color label (round paper thing at the center of the vinyl Lp record), while it was re-pressed/reissued on a black colored ""P"" logo label in the later 1970s.  Still a junk record.

Songs:  ""Let Me Tell You 'Bout Mary,"" songwriter Bobby Bare, also recorded his version on 500 MILES AWAY FROM HOME, RCA/Victor LPM/LSP 2835 (January, 1964 Lp).  ""Can't You See I'm Tryin'"" (GC Capitol 5638, produced by Steve Douglas) shows songwriting credit to Jerry Fuller-Glen Campbell, and was an Lp track on the Knickerbockers' LIES Challenge 622 Lp, produced by Jerry Fuller ('natch), and recorded by the Forte Four on Decca 31979 45 single, produced by Gary Usher (again:  'natch), with Glen Campbell likely on session guitar on that record, also.

Pickwick was a junk/budget bin label, but occasionally releases on such things featured obscure recordings not on those artists' regular full-list major label releases.  One I could recommend, of somewhat oblique Glen Campbell interest, is LOU RAWLS, COME ON IN MISTER BLUES, Pickwick SPC 3156, which is a comp of Lou Rawls pre-Lp Capitol 1962-ish 45 recordings, and in stereo, Merle Travis's ""Nine Pound Hammer"" with Glen Campbell in the session lineup.

Deborah Allen Rocks Great song.  Vastly underappreciated artist.  The video of this song is awesome as well.,1
"Magnificient! What an awesome voice Susan Boyle has. When she opens her mouth, I am blown away. I love everything that she sings.

"Disappointing Quality I owned this vinyl lp as a child and still have it, with all the snaps, crackles and pops that go with a late 1950's album. This product is not available (yet) in CD so I was pleased to find it available as an MP3 download here to play for my grandson. After I downloaded the songs I was very dismayed to find the music plays at a much slower speed and lower octave than the original vinyl. This obviously happened when the person or company who transferred the vinyl to digital used a slow playing turntable. Bob Keeshan's voice sounds like a low baritone in this download and the songs drag rather than zip along. I reported this to Amazon the next day and they refunded my money promptly and said they would ""report it"". This should be easy to fix and hopefully a treasured album will be ""perfect"" again, but until then avoid it!",0
"Should have been weeded out by Amazon.com One of Maynard Ferguson's least jazzy albums was also one with the greatest general appeal. Some very pretty ballads and nice arrangements. The sound of this download version, however, is poorer than I could have made myself by running my old LP through commercial conversion software. This was made from a very worn LP with less than adequate conversion software, in my opinion. You may want to wait until a more sonically pure version is offered.",0
One Star I purchased this by mistake. I don't support artists who make a 'clean version' of a explicit offering.,0
"Maybe classic, but sound quality low I bought this album because brahms no. 4 is one of my favorite, and so is bso. The amazon page lacks any description of conductor, time of performance etc. After downloading it i found the sound quality rather bad. From the other review I learned it's conducted by Charles Munch, and the time of performance must be 50 yrs ago. So this album must have been remastered from LP. I would rather buy an album more recent but sounds better. So be aware.",0
In praise of Gayatri mantra. Quite innovative! very pleasant relaxing music. I would be interested in listening to the others in this series. Will do it in due time.,1
"THE German Beer Drinking Album to have Over the years I have collected several dozen ""Oktoberfest"" albums. I am of German descent, and I love the classic beer hall music, and to my ears, this is the ONE album that really makes me feel that I an ""there"". Perhaps because this is the album I ""grew up with"" as a battered LP, this is my all time favorite of the genra. I had converted to old LP to cassette format, the burnit to a CD, then converted it to an MP3. You cannot imagine my delight when I found it available as a commercial MP3 dowload (minus all of the scratches, pops, and hiss). If you are looking for ""the one"" album of German beer drinking music, look no further - you have found it!",1
How did I ever miss this song? Just when I thought I had heard all that Jimi and the Experience had brought us...,1
"Noel Coward is great...The recording is poor While Noel Coward is highly entertaining, this recording was poorly done. There is a reason this album is less than $2 -- it sounds as if someone found an old vinyl record and set up the microphone to the speaker and recorded these MP3s from that. The recording is very scratchy just like on old vinyl LP. It also sounds like was recorded in mono. The high notes cause the headphones on my iPod to play static. The orchestra sounds flat, and there is no brilliance in Noel Coward's performance.

There is a reason that this has been put into two separate MP3s instead of individual tracks -- the first one is side A from the vinyl record and the second track is side B! Do not purchase this recording until it becomes remastered by the studio. I am highly disappointed by this.",0
Enjoyable song. Great Tune!,1
"Unable To Download This is not about the album. It's about amazon not allowing me to listen to the album. It won't allow me to download, and when i tried to download the amazon music library, it downloaded the UK version! I can't find a way to return it and it's really aggravating. Amazon, get your stuff together. I'll delete this when the problem gets fixed.",0
Two Stars not so good sounding,0
Hypnotic Trance to Dance To or Chill To A solid trance EP that is hypnotic and otherworldly.  It casts a spell on the senses that conjures up sonic illusions rife with the smell of dry ice and the peripheral flash of lasers.,1
"Great music, but no track separation... I loved the music, but was disappointed by the fact that I was unable to separate the tunes, which are back-to-back on this CD/MP3 complilation. That means I am unable to select the tunes individually, either as MP3s or as a CD which I had planned to burn. Also the fact that there are no details of recording dates or personnel. Apart from Cannonball Adderley, Johnny Coles and Gil Evans, I would have like to know who the rest of the band members were, particularly the trombone player who takes a solo. but these are minor complaints compared with the affordable cost.",1
non musicians music My music background is a one course music appreciation class. Nonetheless I have enough tonal sense to know what is good. This is an album I really have an appreciation for. For others who share my musical level this is a recommended album. I really envy those who really understand the music of Jazz.,1
"had the the vinyl years ago & now can enjoy it more had the the vinyl years ago & now can enjoy it more, more often with less fuss with this excellent cd @ a wonderful price - thank you",1
Essential listening !! Classic performance by blues shouter Jimmy Rushing and the Count Basie band.,1

"Good King Wenceslas-Missing Lyrics! The preview for ""Good King Wenceslas"" showed me that they left out some of the lyrics. I'm disappointed, and certainly will get neither this song nor this album.",0

Two Stars Terrible sound quality. That really dims any of the musical charms.,0
Five Stars Awesome,1
Very poor quality. Very old sound. Very poor quality.,0
"Pure Vintage Romance The actual title of the song is When Day is Done (not Gone).  Smooth as silk, Clint delivers a very romantic song in a vintage style that gets your heart yearning for that special someone.",1
"Shabby digitization of Lp - Don't waste your money! It's a disgrace that Amazon as actually charging money for this amateurish reclamation of an Lp.  It's poorly transferred: lots of residual clicks and other artifacts, and, worst of all, it's been put through a limiter!  What a disappointment.

Shame on you, Amazon.

"Warning: This is a dub from a worn LP Ok, loved the record.  Bought this mp3 album thinking I could get closer to the old Capitol master tapes.  Listened to a few samples; sounded reasonable, but the samples aren't full fidelity.  Downloaded the album, only then to discover it was dubbed from a well-worn LP.  I was quite disappointed!  Now, it is GREAT music, and if you don't have it in any format, then its hard to go wrong at $6.99.  But, the album is still common enough in flea markets if you have a record player.  So I have it two stars; great music, disappointing recording.",0
"The First Reviewer Had It Correct. Amazing Performance, Terrible Download Quality I gave this 5 stars, because it's such a great album...but, the first reviewer was correct... quality is tolerable and better than not having it at all.

THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM YOU'LL EVER HEAR OR LOVE! As amazing as it is...you deserve the best possible copy/quality of this recording as you can get!!! For now, that appears to be on used vinyl. This download will do for now and is probably worth the money to download, but, with any luck, someone will find the masters and make us fans, all happy! However, this download will save you the bother of doing the transfer from vinyl yourself until a better quality download or edition on CD comes along!

The title cut, ""Christmas Is For The Family"" and ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" are cult Christmas classics that are revered by Christmas music fans and a mandatory addition to their collection after you've heard them the first time. I've never heard another rendition of either song done so perfectly. You'll love these two and they will easily make it into your Christmas music rotation. Frankly, either or both should have been released as a singles but, the label (Design Records) was not a ""single"" oriented label. Their catalog pertains to popular artists singing songs that are lesser known than their hits or their early recordings after an artist made it big or accomplished singers/musicians doing covers of big tunes. Needless to say, some of these LP's, like this one were destined to become classics. Had ""Christmas Is For The Family"" or ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" been released as singles the year this LP was released, either would have done very well and would now be staples of Christmas music rotation on radio airwaves both local free and satelite radio and more than likely given Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" a run for it's money as the biggest selling Christmas records of all time. ""May Santa Fill Our Hearts"" is another cut on this LP that is another cult classic, and I've never heard another cover of the song. There is some great original material on this LP as well as standards.

On ""Christmas Is For The Family"", side one is ""Popular"" Christmas Classics with stunning lush arrangements wrapped around Dennis Day's voice with full studio orchestra, featuring Lou Hollingsworth at the Wurlitzer Organ, and the Vail Boys Choir. Side two is more of a ""Traditional"" Christmas Classics that you might hear in Church, mostly done with Lou at the Organ and the boys choir again, in arrangements to stir emotions in even the coldest of souls at Christmas Time.

Jack Benny's appearance as ""Santa"" playing the violin on the cover, as well as Jack playing, speaking and singing at the begining and the end of side one and the beginning of side two and another little cameo at the end is a nice bit of nostalgia from when Dennis used to appear regularly on Jack's Television Show that I'm sure was designed to boost LP sales.

Now, aside from that, this is the finest Christmas album you'll ever hear from a man with a voice that was a gift that was meant to sing Christmas Songs, Irish Folk Songs, as well as be shared with the masses.

I am on my 3rd pressing of this Christmas Classic and 4 years ago, I spent over a month, finding pristine copies of this LP to give as Christmas gifts to members of my family who have fond memories of Christmas due to this fine recording.

Unfortunately, IT'S NOT available on CD, YET! I just wish someone could find the masters and have enough sense to re-release it so we can all enjoy this amazing Christmas Classic. Until such time, you'll have to do like I did...get one coverted to CD to get you by till the real thing comes along.",1
"Brilliant Performance, Abysmal Transfer I was thrilled to finally see this recording (which has been part of my Christmas tradition on vinyl and CD-R) available for download.

HOWEVER, the downloaded recording is wretched.  It has more pops and clicks than my 45 year old record.

Amazon should be ashamed.",0
"Announcer-ruined This probably deserves more stars but the announcer is such a slimy bastard that I can't stand to listen to this.  I am not a Herman expert, but I would not suspect that this is his strongest work.  But I can't listen long enough to find out.",0
Brought back memories Loved this song as a child on my mother's album.  Great to find it again.,1
"Great raag-based music with contemporary ensemble arrangements. A 2003 release in an all-instrumental series on the Sona Rupa label of India/UK. All of the albums have similar instrumentation; this one features 2 players of the bansuri (bamboo) flute which makes it especially attractive for me. Other instruments are sarod, sitar, santoor, sarangi, shenai, and tabla and pakhwaj drums. The notes say that the recording was done 'live' with all the musicians together. Acoustic guitar and keyboard are used sparingly.

If you like one album in this series, you'll like them all (I have about 10). Instrumental songs which are rooted in classical musics of India (the raag of each is noted), but given contemporary ensemble arrangements, slightly like what you'd hear in a western jazz ensemble with the 'head' of the song and multiple solos. The resulting songs, most less than 10 minutes, are probably more accessible to the uninitiated western listener than the 'pure classical' musics of India.",1
"Very best I got this album in India and I love I dian Music,  but this although not in a classical style it is very, very nice
the artist team are the best ones.
I lament the are not more of this same group and  arrenger.",1
Five Stars Great song,1
"Can't get enough I've been keeping an ear on this group fo a while. These new tracks are more pop than previous work. As usual, Jay's vocals are incredible. This is very strong stuff. I expect to see a lot more of these guys as word gets around. Highly recommended.",1
Nice scout song! I love his music.,1
"loved it! enjoyed this album. he's different than what anyone else is making, so it's a nice change from the monotony. but it.",1
Love! Well I heard this song glee and I absolutely love it. I just had to buy it!,1
Love the Song Helped open me up to a new world of music and I absolutely love the show and the songs they sing.,1
"Not Even For Bon Jovi & A Rolling Stone When it does come down to it, the cast of Glee has done some really pathetic covers. When I heard them recently do a cover of Whitney Houston's I Look To You, I really thought that they just really killed the rawness and the intimate appeal of the song. They've done the same idea when they've mixed two rock classics together into one song, by mixing Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer, and the classic Rolling Stones anthem Start Me Up, it feels like the killjjoy of 2 die hard fans into one badly made opus. It feels like the songs from the Rock Of Ages musical feel like a better novelty to listen to than what the cast of Glee has done with beautiful songs. I also think the producers of Glee should try and deliver more original songs than the feeling of covers being more like gags with crescent rolls.

* Research Notes: Mantovani albums are a little difficult to research now for someone like myself who was not there to be collecting them at the time.  While I have about 50 Mantovani LP albums, most from my parent's collection and some purchased used, most do not have dates printed on them anywhere.  The current best source of album listings that I have found is at[...].  Wikipedia's Mantovani page lists 2 additional Christmas albums: Christmas Carols, London LL 913; and Merry Christmas to All of You, Decca 66445009 (1963).  I cannot find any other references to either of these albums anywhere.  There is an extensive LP (and even old 78s) listing on the mantovani-orchestra(dot)com site, but it does not include many US albums that I own and it appears that the catalog numbers there are non-US.

"Great Christmas Album from 1967 My parents bought this album in 1967 from Goodyear for $1.00.  I was 6 years old then...I'm 52 now.  Not ONE Christmas has gone by since without listening to this Christmas classic! Every song is better than the last. God Bless these wonderful artists for giving us this gem for all of the many Christmases of the past, present and future!",1
"I heard 610 bells on Christmas Day The 1964 RCA VICTOR LP entitled Let's Ring the Bells ALL AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE (LPM/LST-2914) is a souvenir of the New York World's Fair. It includes an album-sized four page booklet, ""Of Bells and Carillons,"" from which comes much of the trivia here.

The RCA and Coca-Cola pavilions were close neighbors at the Fair. Victor's John Klein was also musical director for Coke and the Carillonneur of their pavilion's centerpiece, what was then the world's largest carillon: a 120-foot tower housing 610 chimes capable of many different tones: Flemish bells, Harp, Lute, Aeolian, Baroque, Celestial and several others.

The original carillons were far simpler devices that required many ringers to operate a few roped bells that weighed tons. Modern carillons are electro-mechanical marvels controlled by keyboards, stops and pedals, their sounds created by miniature bronze bells weighing mere ounces instead of pounds or tons. The secret is a series of audio amplifiers and speakers. The Coca-Cola carillon had 57 directional speakers (stentors), some five-feet across, that projected 3,000 watts of amplified sound.

Principal recordings for ""All Around the Christmas Tree"" of Henry Ren&eacute;'s orchestra and chorus were made at Webster Hall in NYC. Master tapes, equipment and engineers then relocated to Flushing Meadow, Queens and the Coke pavilion, where Mr. Klein added his bells on a separate tape track. The results are nothing less than remarkable, what sounds like a concert of perfectly blended orchestra, voices and carillon.

One of the most unique holiday albums ever, this one gets a highest recommendation!

"Rare Christmas Treasure Christmas Bells, with organist Richard Keys Biggs, is a rare find nowadays in any format.  It originally appeared in the 50s on a monaural LP (Capitol T-9013).  It is that edition which I found at Amazon (Sold by Looney Geeks).  Given the rarity of the recording, one must be prepared to accept pops and crackles, and there are a goodly sprinkling of those throughout both sides.  The sound, of course, is typical of the early days of high fidelity.  That said, the record is well worth owning if you can find a copy.  The carols are played with deep and heart-felt simplicity, with no fancy arranging.  The chimes are very well used to accentuate the simple directness of Biggs' interpretations of a goodly selection of the most beloved carols.  The only drawback with regard to the copy I received is that it was plainly advertised as an audio CD (which obviously it is not).  I had fully expected the item to be a remake by someone from the original vinyl, and am somewhat disappointed that such was not the case.  By and large, though, the quality of the disc is quite acceptable although the price ($24.95) iwas a bit steep, given that the disc is not in pristine condition.  Nevertheless, if you can find one, BUY IT!",1
Five Stars I love the song Barely Breathing!,1
Not what I expected Doesn't seem to be the full score. Songs are incomplete and some seem to be cut out altogether. Not too happy with this purchase.,0
"1962 Version missing part of the Finale Although there is no information about this recording on Amazon, I believe it is the 1962 D'Oyly Carte version originally issued on vinyl as London OSA 1248. At the time it was the the best recording you could buy. However, presumably due to the constraints imposed by 4 sides of vinyl, the Finale is missing four verses starting with ""Having been a wicked baronet a week."" I really missed them at the time since they are among my favorite parts: who wouldn't like ""For to settle in the town of Basingstoke."" I was hoping that this rerelease would include the missing material, but it does not.

I have ripped my own vinyl and I was also hoping this would be a cleaner version, but its not. The sound quality is quite poor.

I wish that someone would find the missing verses (they must have been recorded) and clean up the sound and re-rerelease this. That effort would likely produce the best Ruddigore available.",0
0.89  One song ??? I thought I would get the whole album for 0.89 not one song!!,0

"Unbelievable This is a rare, and beautiful album of orchestral magic which George Melachrino recorded in stereo for the wonderful RCA in 1958. This is part of a set of several albums he did for RCA including Music for: Reading, Relaxation, Dining and so on, and were some of RCA's very FIRST popular stereo albums (LSP 1000,1001,1002).... WELL, one's hopes are dashed. This is a bad needle drop transfer, and tracks 2-6 have been so badly recorded that they are not listenable. What is this Hallmark company, and WHAT are they doing?  I suggest a few weeks with Mike Dutton to learn how to do PROPER musical transfers. The musical material merits 5 STARS, the transfer 0,  so it has to get a 2.",0
"This album really rocks! I was skeptical when I heard about this compilation of music because, as a huge RUSH fan, I expected it to really fall short. Apparently DARKSTAR originally had a bunch of great, classic RUSH songs as the soundtrack, and due to some crappy Hollywood greed tactics by Universal, the Producers dumped the idea and replaced the songs with their own, custom scored music. It is amazing, and truly lives up to the expectations one would expect of a AAA touring act. The music ranges from eerie, ambient tracks to full out rockers.  Jimmy Pitts on keyboards is epic, his style more aligned to virtuosic guitar work like you'd expect from Vai, but the guitar neck laid out on a table for the talented Pitts to burn up with hand-played arpeggios and leads that seem impossible on keyboards. Likewise, Bill Bruce is phenomenal with his tasteful passages, grinding rhythms, and signature classical guitar riffs mixed with well written layered leads.  If you're a fan of Vai, Zappa, TSO, Rush, Yes, and all progressive, this is the record for you.",1
HOME MADE RIP-OFF??? I couldn't believe Amazon is selling this.  This is CLEARLY A HOME-MADE TYPE COVER and SONG LISTING - and ITUNES DOESN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE SONGS - ITunes just lists TRACK #s.  What's going on?!,0
Five Stars Delightful version of this song.,1
"Best Meditation/Relaxation Selection! I have about fifty hour-plus long meditation/relaxation mp3's from various composers and this one is the VERY BEST...by far.
Other selections by the same artist aren't as good for me, but this one is excellent. Highly recommend!",1
Wouldn't open It simply wouldn't open in Windows 7.,0
Love this song Tie one On! This is a Classic Country Swing Song that is as good today as ever! I think this is the best song the Wilburns ever did and I think even Ernest Tubb did it in his own fashion. Get up and Swing dance with this song!,1
"He remains a great favorite. Two things led me to buying this ... Fats Domino was as meaningful as any other artist (except perhaps for Buddy Holly) in my early music appreciation days. I didn't have a lot of 45s in those years but there was more Fats than anyone. He remains a great favorite.
Two things led me to buying this single. One was that I never have owned it and as such had never heard the B side until I bought an ACE Fabulous Flips compilation years back. I don't have nearly the 45s I used to but I do have a jukebox to feed. The other is that ""Before I Grow Too Old"" is not on the 4 disc Imperial box. A sad oversight.
I rank ""Before I Grow Too Old"" in my top 10 Fats Domino songs. If  you still play 45s, seek this single out. The A side is no slouch either. If not I recommend the ACE Fabulous Flips Vol. 3",1
"Nice music Relaxing and better than that Free!!!!!
It helps calm you if you've had a stressful day. Great product and would buy more",1

"Not what I was looking for I was looking for the song that they sing in White Christmas. This is a studio version, not the version in the movie. Not even close. Very bummed. I listened to the sample and it sounded like the correct version, but after buying it I now know better.",0

"This was a great find!  My brother is 30 years old and loves Danny Kaye! My brother is going to flip when he opens this gift...We had a lot of these songs on tape that we used to listen to on record or in the car when we were little kids with my mom.  My mom just passed away this October.  This gift will mean so much to my brother!
Thank you!",1
"who is a fantastic singer. Someone should correct The mp3 listings on this album are scrambled!  The song I wanted was. ""He Lifts Me Higher"".  I got the song by downloading ""When Was The Last Time"".  A disservice to John Bowman, who is a fantastic singer.  Someone should correct.",0

"The Quartetto Gelato version is a delightfully different and spirited rendition of this classic portion of The Nutcracker Suite.

As usual, the quality of Amazon's download is superior to any CD or DVD recording.",1

I bought this mp3 thinking that it was a song ... I bought this mp3 thinking that it was a song. But its not a song it's just him preaching,0
A Great Project! Poet Voices have created a wondeful collection of songs as only the PVs can do.  I really enjoyed the mixing of different musical styles with Southern Gospel Music.  The best version of Sweeter as The Days Go By that  I have ever heard.,1

My Help - Love it! This song is based on my favorite Psalm (121). The first time I heard it I cried! The combination of the strong voice and the beautiful music bring out the power of the words. Reminds me that the Lord will always take care of me,1

Five Stars Great,1
... song to listen to and Carrol Roberson does a great job with it I listen to it over and ... this song really expresses the true meaning of Christmas It is a comforting song to listen to and Carrol Roberson does a great job with it I listen to it over and over both during the Christmas season and all through the year,1
"Have loved this song since I first bought it on cassette tape! Love Carroll Robertson!  Love this song!  I was so upset the first Christmas I realized I couldn't listen to this any longer since I no longer had a cassette tape player to play it!  Beautiful song, great lyrics! Gotta love digital!  Go ahead, buy it!  You know you want to!  You'll be glad you did!",1

The Junction Very good very slept on crew led by Menace 2 Society actor Saafir the Saucee' Nomad they are all very talented creative rhymers the beats range from hard to harder and mellow as for the hobos the rip through the tracks leatherface with a brand new chainsaw I tell you if rappers achieved success from pure talent alot of these guys on the radio would be in trouble if your a head pic this up you won't be disappointed,1
Wonderful Song! I really like up beat Southern Gospel. I had never heard of this group but I enjoyed this song very much.,1
"Randolph Vet Baldhead Rick has been on records since 94 or 95 but this is only his 2nd solo.
It would be rare to find this you should deffo pick up the mp3-at this price it's a steal.
One of the rare cd's where i didn't skip a song and the quality is so good.
There are a few club bangers,couple of sex songs and sick gangsta songs-love this album.
Plenty of guest features too-Cellski,Cougnut(r.i.p),San Quinn,Ad kapone,C-Fresh all the frisco rap vets.
Can't believe i'm the first to review-buy it and im sure you will post your own!!",1
Another grade A  cover I really like this song. I liked the original and I like this cover/remix as well. Sounds really nice. Is this actually Passion Pit?,1
"If 4 were 5 I came across this by accident because I was hoping to find a live version from Kenny Wayne Shepherd because I've heard him do this song live twice & he does an incredible job. This version by Scott Finch is very decent, but seems a little uninspired. The guitar work is great, but just isn't quite there, and the singing is certainly missing in spots, however, this is a very decent version and is well worth $ .99. I'd give this a 3.5 if I could, but it doesn't deserve a 3 because it is better than that.",1
"Why Not Do It Properly? Smoke Dreams is one of my favorite records, and Ronnie Deauville was a great singer. But what you can hear on this CD and the identical iTunes album is an absolutely unacceptable work. Processing the sound on my Mac, I had to increase the speed by 10% to match the real speed of my LP. And removing the clicks was a quite simple job to do, so I wonder why it couldn't be done when preparing this CD for release. If you are looking for this album, better try to find an original LP.",0
"Music is running SLOW!  Terrible transfer!  Avoid..1 star is 1 too many! It's hard to believe an MP3 download this bad is offered at amazon.  It's obvious this is merely a transfer from a vinyl disc and the record player is running pretty darn slow!  This isn't a bad album for those that remember it from Welk's mid-1950's Coral releases with the likes of Alice Lon, Lennon Sisters, Larry Hooper, Larry Dean, etc., but goodness...if you're going to offer the thing, let's get it right!!  Alice Lon sounds rather like Larry Hooper, Welk's bass singer!",0
"If you are going to buy one CD this year ... If you are going to buy one CD this year, buy this one. There is a song for every situation in life and it is my ""go to"" CD for: parties, intimate dinners, time alone with a glass-or two--of wine, get togethers with friends, when i want to dance. Phoebe Legere's vocals melt my heart and her musicianship is stellar. I saw one other reviewer referred to Phoebe as a ""National Treasure."" Agree for sure but let's up the ante to ""International Treasure."" Phoebe makes me want to sing, dance, learn to play piano and start speaking French. I adore her talent.",1
Libre - For the fans Already had all the songs and the extras but had to have this as part of the collection. Don't understand a lick of French but that's ok. The tunes are enough to get you in. I like some more than others but happy enough to give it a listen through all the way.,1
"so it probably sucks. I don't remember this song, so it probably sucks.",0

Not worth the money Not what I was expecting. . . it doesn't offer advice. Wish I hadn't bought it.,0
"A Great Song, And Great For Listening To All Year After Julian Casablanca's recent solo album, I was hungry for more, and stumbled on this track. What a great song! It's short and rocking, definitely more guitar driven(and sounds more like a pumped-up Strokes song) than his solo album. Though it's a Christmas song, this will stay in my playlist all year. Here's hoping there's more where this came from....",1
Five Stars well produced.,1
This is a great song and is an example of why I enjoyed Springsteen so much in his earlier years. Outstanding vintage Springsteen.,1
Short It is only 52 seconds,0
Awful Awful Quality for this song. I thought it would be better.,0
"Great funy song I love this song. And the movie and before that the TV series,  I  have made a CD of this song and many other old and new family friendly songs for all of our road trip we take all summer long. Is a great CD when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids",1
"Five Stars wonderful, rich and lush",1
"Did I say his LOVE album was the one I was waiting for?  I was wrong. Don't let the name ""Foetus"" fool you--when I was first recommended Thirlwell's music, I though it was going to be some terrible goth or metal nonsense.  How wrong I was.

Everyone who knows me knows that I am almost pathologically obsessed with Thirlwell's musical output.  Despite his proclivity it seems like nobody knows who he is--and even when you find a Foetus fan (usually online) discussing his music they focus on some of his older stuff, like NAIL or HOLE.  The problem here is not that Thirlwell got worse over time--the problem is is that he attracted lot of fans of the overly broad designation of ""industrial music.""  The result is that many of those that do know who he is cling to the era when his sound was closer to early ""industrial"" and noise music.

If there is anything Thirlwell is not, it is being an artist that has the same sound over his entire career.  In some ways it's hard to believe that the same genius that created NAIL also produced this fantastic orchestral brilliance.  In fact, the Thirlwell of the past--usually wearing some guise, most famously the  ""Clint Ruin"" persona--seems radically different from the Thirlwell we see today.  Compare the pictures of Thirlwell back then standing amid impaled hog heads to him in a suit conducting for a live performance of Manorexia.  Thirlwell has never been content to stay in the same place.

Every Thirlwell album, then, is a delightful new surprise, and I had waited for this album in near-agony, and the delays only compounded by impatience.  Remember how excited you used to get near Christmas back during your childhood?  That's how I felt waiting for this album to finally arrive into my mailbox, except in this case, Christmas was delayed at least twice due to Santa Claus to finally get his sleigh painted the right color before leaving the North Pole. (This metaphor makes sense only to those that followed the delays of this album).  A little voice inside me wondered how Thirlwell could top LOVE, and how I'd probably be disappointed after all that waiting, because I'm just negative that way.  Foetus isn't often very uplifting to listen to, so I suppose I can be forgiven for my pessimism.  Fortunately, I was glad I was wrong--this may be Thirlwell's best album yet, and it's probably my favorite.  He took what made LOVE so good and made it even better.

HIDE is a concept album with held together by the themes of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty; lyrical references throughout are apocalyptic (particularly ""Oilfields"") and numerous references to fear-stirring events that were current during the album's production (e.g., ""anthrax in the envelope""), and it seems that Thirlwell envisioned the album as being the sountrack to a movie that exists only within his own head--which is something you may expect from an artist that already outputs fantastic cinematically-inspired pieces (check out Manorexia!) and has expressed a desire to score for a big-budget movie. Cosmetics, for example, comes across as a bombastic, operatic opening while O Putrid Sun sounds like something that would play to rolling credits after a downer of an ending.  Throughout Thirlwell adeptly mixes ""haunting"" with ""beautiful"" and does so over a large range of style.  I'll let other reviewers go more in-depth over the individual songs, they're better at describing them than I am.

Also, I forgot to describe the cover art.  For a lack of proper adjectives I'll close this review by stating that it's ""pretty friggin' awesome,"" which you can see for yourself.",1
"Bad Sound Quality Great music, fuzzy sound quality. So, no dice on this one.",0
"Extremely poor copy from an excellent LP I have this excellent LP and my copy is in good shape. Have transfered it into a CD and now I thought I was buying a ""Digitally Remastered"" CD transfer, as it was announced at the site. Should have stayed with my non-remastered copy that is much, really much better than this copy. I can' really believe this was remastered, otherwise the copied LP is in an awful shape and, again, should not have been used for commercial purposes. Avoid it and wait for a decent copy.",0
"5 star music 1 star sound quality This is another muddy scratchy LP transfer this company is trying to pawn off as ""remastered""  It's a shameless attempt to turn a buck. Do yourself a favor and get the LP. The music is wonderful and features Antonio Carlos Jobim on guitar listed as ""Tony Brazil""",0
"Poorly produced reissue This supposedly remastered release seems to have been made from a very scratchy LP. Some of the noise was digitally reduced, but mostly it's there in the form of a constant crunchy sound that distracts from the music.

Perhaps the tapes were lost, but they surely could have found a better copy to do this reissue from. They also misidentified at least some of the titles. Avoid.",0
"My review is for AMAZON.COM itself Amazon, I attempted to download this track 3 days ago and it didn't work and told me to contact you.

I then got an email saying you're working on it but still haven't heard from you or received a follow-up.

$0.99 is no biggie to me, but principle is.

Right now, you're failing in that principle.",0
Powerful Focus Session Subtle yet very powerful. I love it!!,1
"Do you hear what I hear? Another great EP from FOF.  The guys know how to deliver powerful alternative rock to classic carols.
HIGHLIGHTS:
-Guitars operate on FOF's well known grand scale, creating great audio landscapes, especially on ""Do you hear what I hear?""-------really feel like a shepherd out on that incredible night.
-Instrumental track isn't a simply filler, but is really a great intro into the epic rendition of ""Pie Jesu"".  Works great.
-Nice balance between symphonic guitars, acoustic, vocals and piano.  ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" has a kind of coffee house feel to it, and then ""The Earth Stood Still"" nearly brings tears to your eyes.  Amazing musical diversity between 6 tracks.
DRAWBACKS:
-4 stars only because it's an EP--------------I guess if you combine it with the 1st ""Advent"", you kind of have a full-length Christmas album.  It's just short, and you're thirsting for more by the end of ""Pie Jesu"".

Overall, great EP.  Perfect for listening in and out of the season.",1

"Annyoying Beginning - Don't Buy This Version! the first 20 seconds of the version of this song has a very high pitched tick-tick-tick sound (not in a cool way) and is very annoying.  I did not want to hear this version repeately.  The first time was enough. Unfortunately the sample music of this version does not play the song from the very beginning, so I did not see this coming.  I basically need to throw out this version of the song off my playlist, waste $1 and try to forget about the time wasted to download this song, etc.  Hope you guys purchase a different version and not run into the same mistake I did.",0
"pretty shallow, boring and definitely not enough Not gonna lie.... pretty shallow, boring and definitely not enough.... well anything really. The songs are all too short and underdeveloped. There are hints of something but it never quite breaks through. Generic would be a good word for this album.",0
"RLE's AD scores a D Prior to listening to this album I read a few reviews. About half of the reviews themselves were positive and half were negative. But the comments were 90% negative, made up of people ripping this band apart for any reason from a lack of originality to their cocky personalities off-stage to their cookie-cutter image. This band must have upset quite a few people in their quest for fame.

The EP itself starts off alright. The chanting at the beginning of the first track made me a little excited, but as soon as the lead singer came in, I was immediately turned off. His voice is extremely nasally. It's a good thing that the EP is only 14 minutes (not a single song over the 3 minute mark), because his voice is painful. The guitarwork, drumming, and keyboards are all great, and it's a shame that they have such a terrible singer. I'd really like to love this band since their name comes from one of my favorite childhood movies Three Ninjas, but I just CANNOT get over how annoying his voice is.",0
"AMAZING! This album is sick nasty! I've been a fan before they even got signed! cannot wait to hear more from these guys, I don't regret buying this album at all, I love every single second of it :]",1
Great This was purchased as a gift. Everything looks and works as advertised. I would have heard back by now if there were any problems. They loved this gift!,1
Five Stars The best!!,1
so so I love live recordings but this one felt more like a hack job to me. It is early 70s and early in Springsteen's career so maybe I got what I paid for.,0
"Always a great song, now bittersweet in 2012 after the Sandy, the storm, took out the setting for this tune. You can rarely go wrong with early Springsteen.  This was written 30+ years ago as the song of a frustrated young man.  Now in 2012 it is haunting as it reminds us of what a super storm took away from the Jersey shore.  Like most poets, what Springsteen writes transcends one meaning and can be applied to so many more experiences.",1

"Not on CD Album from 1958 by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas (1912-90), which (as far as I'm aware) has never appeared on CD.

Tracks 2 & 4 and 6-9 are songs by Enrique Montoya; the Danza Mora is a guitar solo, transcribed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Selected-Solos-for-Guitar-by-Sabicas-Escudero/dp/B001EULSTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Selected Solos for Guitar by Sabicas & Escudero</a>&nbsp;(Hansen, 1962).  The others are guitar duets with either Sabas's brother Diego or Mario Escudero.  Anita Ramos provides castanets.

Track 9 is mislabelled a Granadina; it is in fact a Sole (track 6 is a Granadina)

But this album was recorded in stereo, and Amazon's samples sound to me like mono!  Ecchh.  It's like listening through a hole in the wall.  In my opinion you'd be better off with the stereo LP (ABC-Paramount ABCS-239).",0

"Simple But Endearing I admit I'm a big fan of Michael McGlynn's voice, his writing and arrangements so I may not be totally objective here. This is a simple, plaintive and gentle melody and that's exactly why it works. For me, it captures the innocence of children and the Christmas season that we all wish we could recreate. This song is worthy of more attention. Michael could sing the phonebook and I'd listen. It's an example of how less is often more and a fine example of the ease with which Michael's voice flows throughout his range. It may disappoint those wanting to hear more of Anuna, (though their soft back-up is just right here in my opinion.)",1
watch what you download I love the song but I purchased the wrong one. this one has talking at the end of it. so I won't listen to it. this one is live so to me it ruined it,0

"I liked it a lot... This song was really great! Until of course it suddenly ended in the middle of it. It sounds like its been ripped from a mix but would they really sell it like that? Either way, expect a sudden, unexplainable ending at 7:40

EDIT: I see now that it is an edit from the original mix, but it is still cut off at a terrible point. I'd rather they had cut the first 3 minutes out and had the next three in since the beginning doesn't even sound like that actual song.",0
"Great Adult Contemporary Music This is cd is full of upbeat, sophisticated music.  The lyrics are thoughtful.  the music is full of catchy rhythms and expertly mixes a variey of instruments including guitar,trumpet,and saxophone.  I enjoyed all of the songs, but for those of you looking for an upbeat positive and dancable song, I suggest trying Top of the World.  Finally a CD of creative music not written for tweens!!!  I highly recommend you check Matt Rodela's music out.",1
"Absolutely terrible. I watched it all the way through Absolutely terrible. I watched it all the way through, but it was an effort.  I don't like music where screaming makes up a large percentage of the vocals.  They have several songs that I do like, but they're not on this dvd.  I gave it away.  If you want to see a great concert that you'll watch over & over, get Shinedown's ""Somewhere in the Stratosphere"" 4 disc set.  Nothing short of amazing.  And that boy can sing.",0

"Sorry I bought it. I bought this (and another of their Christmas albums) based on a couple YouTube videos.  The quality on the videos was much better than the quality of the albums.  I was hoping these would become a family favorite, but they were generally considered so-so by the family.  Oh well!",0
"A disappointment An&uacute;na's first Christmas album, ""Christmas Songs,"" did not contain one track that failed to deliver the group's signature haunting choral arrangement of folk, ecclesiastical, traditional and classical/ancient pieces.  Listening to these initial samples of this one, I can say with a fair amount of confidence if you own that first Christmas album, I am here to tell you that you are likely to be disappointed with ""Christmas with An&uacute;na.""

The only tracks on this disc that fully capture that haunting beauty that we have come to love in and expect from An&uacute;na are ""Nol Nouvelet"" and ""Sanctus,"" and this latter has already long been available on their first album.

Not that all the others are bad.  ""Angelus ad Virginam"" is a little bit different from their original arrangement - a little bit more of a tribal Celtic folk beat to it, but still enjoyable and choral.  The child solist in ""Away in a Manger"" is sweet, but set against the old backing ""Oooo""s of the piece it feels kind of like a cheap cop-out.  ""Ding Dong Merrily on High"" and ""Codail a Linbh"" seem promising, but the arrangements start to stray almost more into the nauseous nostalgia, rather than choral, category of Christmas music.

This perhaps wouldn't be so noticable except that the other tracks stray progressively further in that direction, and ""Christmas Memories,"" ""Christmas Kisses"" and ""Angels Are Singing"" are clearly vanity puff-pieces arranged in the manner of the dreaded Christmas nostalgia soloist album.  All of them are absolute disasters, and completely unexpected from An&uacute;na.

Had they done away with these last three tracks and gotten rid of ""O Tannenbaum"" (an upbeat carol that does NOT work with choral arrangements no matter how much you wish it did), ""The First Nol"" (a sappy song that will ALWAYS sound like nostalgia music no matter how hard you try) and ""Away in a Manger"" (which, though not bad here, suffers terribly in comparison to the arrangement on the first album) and tried just a little bit harder to find good ecclesiastical motets or other traditional folk songs in other European languages (and there are plenty), that might have made up for the mediocrity of the other tracks.  Unfortunately, the few really good tracks make the rest of the album VERY pale by comparison.",0
Not worthy of price Really thought I was ordering an album of his older songs..  Sorry to find that it was only one song and not one of his best either.,0
GREAT. GREAT.,1
This is a perfect song. Nobody but Elvis can sing this song!!! This is a perfect song.,1

"Idol fans blew it. Paul may have the most original male voice to ever be heard on the Idol stage.  How the American Public could have voted this guy off before Jacob, Stefano, James, etc., is beyond me.

This album is fantastic - and is exactly what I expected from Paul McDonald: a solid rock album with hints of country and blues mixed in.  His voice is fantastic and I predict he will be one of the only people to do anything after this season (the other will be Pia).  Whoever wins 2011 Idol will fade away before the year ends, no doubt about it.

I love this record.",1
"A CD You Want to Listen To Over and Over Listening to Paul and The Grand Magnolias is like hanging out with a group of people you really like and have fun with. I'm SO glad Paul was on American Idol, because if he hadn't been, this little gem might not have been noticed. Paul got my interest during the auditions when he sang Maggie Mae, and I don't even like that song. Besides being a great singer, Paul is a songwriter and every song on this CD is worth listening to again and again. I don't really know which song I like better. ""Whoa"" reminds me of something off the new Black Keys CD Brothers. I find myself humming the catchy tune of ""American Dreams."" ""Sing Out"" has a positive and inspiring message that is very timely right now. ""Please Believe Me"" is an upbeat love song. There really isn't a weak song on the whole album. I just hope The Grand Magnolias put on a show in my area. I think they are a band that is even better live.",1
"WILL THE REAL MUSICAL JOKE PLEASE STAND UP???! This adulation of Horowitz has been making me nauseous all life.  He has never displayed any respect for composers intentions, plays everything the way he ""likes"" and always with a tight, hypernervous and unrelaxed approach to the keyboard that makes anything he does fatiguing to the ear and sometimes the eye.

As bad as his RCA recordings are, these DGG recordings makes them sound trancendantal.  I keep a few of them in my vast CD collection of mostly super quality recordings for comparison purposes only, to illustrate what a crappy pianist and musician he was.  By the time these DGG recordings were made, he was so past any considerations concerning correct style and composer's intentions that the interpretations, if you want to call them that, are completely haywire.  DGG must have recorded them only for the subsequent monetary rewards.  To ""musicians"" like Horowitz, the music they play is nothing more than the fancy clothes they put on to impress the intellectually vapid and ignorant.

I hope all of you Horowitz fanatics are both shocked and perplexed to see their hero so trashed and ill-respected.  So sorry, but it's long overdue.  His performances are nothing more than case studies for musical archeologists and pathologists.",0
"Wow.  Unexpectedly powerful. Even as a ZO2 fan, when I first heard this song I had to look up who did it.  Talk about a powerful and moving testament to the depths of one band.  This opens a whole new dimension to their range and talent.  Very glad to hear drummer Joey Cassata's voice so crisp and clear on a powerful track like this.  I believe this will be a break-out song for them once it hits the mainstream.  The drummer singing a powerful break-out ballad?  Kind of reminds you of ZO2 idol KISS's ""Beth"", doesn't it?",1

"Disappointed I've been a huge fan of Caedmon's Call for nearly a decade.  They're music was simply superior to any other Christian group out there.  In the Company of Angels remains one of my favorite all-time albums of any band.

But I agree with another reviewer that I don't know where this band is going, and it isn't good IMO.  The music and lyrics of this album are inferior to past albums.  Cliff Young is their best singer, and he's not heard much.  And worse, they're heart for worship just isn't there anymore.
Caedmon's Call --- if you read this review --- I love you guys for the great music over the past decade and more.  But this albums stinks.  Return to whatever you were doing and whoever you were working with, because I'm going to have to listen to the next album closely before I buy it.",0
"Disappointed Long Time Fan I have always loved Caedmon's Call and I was extremely excited that they were finally releasing a new album. However, I was very disappointed with this new album Raising Up The Dead. I do not like the sound or direction of this album. I guess I will continue to listen to my older Caedmon's CDs and leave this one alone. I am a disappointed long time fan.",0
"Beethoven Piano Works Review - Tina D.
TZVI EREZ, piano

This album is an absolute treat for Beethoven enthusiasts. Hard to believe that on one album or CD you find five (5)  Sonatas, namely the Moonlight Sonata as well as the Sonata Pathetique, consisting of three parts each, also Sonatas No. 13 and 17, plus the well known ""Fur Elise"" and the Spring Sonata - all compliment this outstanding musical treat. The last item on his program is the lovely Sonatina Anh. 5-Romanze- Andante, which no doubt, you will adore, as I do.  This program has been carefully chosen by Mr. Erez, who interprets Beethoven in an absolute realistic  exercise. This pianist`s touch is gentle where required and temperamental  where necessary, which creates an exiting interpretation of the music, yet at all times he strictly adheres to the composer's writings. These works are  performed on a 1912 Vintage Bosendorfer, which needs no introduction.  This certainly will be a nice addition to your Beethoven collection.",1

His treatment of Thelonious Monk's tunes are stellar and a fresh take on his timeless music. Hearing Oz recreate those demented chords is really something. The song ""Minor Shuffle"" should be played at every funeral and wake as people file out of the place.",1

"not your music like everyone else posting here, I got my track from garageband loops. Don't claim it is your music, it's not. Unless you licensed it to apple, which in case you were paid I'm sure, which means you have no rights to it. Its distributed with their software, which makes it FREE to use as my own creation.",0
"This isn't music, it's just noise I came to this piece of music because IODA--a group that supposedly protects independent music artists--claimed that the happy, peppy, electronic, free-to-use loop I got from GarageBand and used in iMovie to help create a YouTube video about my illustrations was this. Because of IODA's claim, YouTube slapped a link to this piece of music on my video. Basically, the link says that if you want to buy the music from my video, you could click and buy that piece of music from Amazon, GooglePlay or iTunes.

I clicked on the link to Amazon to see if perhaps there might be some legitimate reason IODA thought the music in my video was this and not the actual GarageBand loop I used. It turns out there isn't.

As I said, I used a happy, peppy, electronic GarageBand loop, and this piece of music is depressing, slooooooowwww, and not electronic. I think it's all real instruments, including what sounds like several violins--when there are no violins in the GarageBand music I used--and what I think might be a didgeridoo and a jaw harp. I'm no music expert, but I can tell the difference between happy, peppy, electronic music and depressing, slow, real instruments. IODA's claim is like claiming Beethoven wrote the music for You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.

""The Dream That Dreams Us"" is, in my opinion, bad enough, but to claim that this is the same music as that on someone else's video--when it clearly isn't--is outrageous. IODA found a way to get YouTube to provide free advertising for their music at the expense of others, and YouTube doesn't provide video owners with any way to object. IODA gets to be plaintiff, judge and jury. Here, though, I can tell you the truth, so you don't have to fall for it.",0

"Such a huge huge disappointment. A beautiful piece of music to meant to ... Such a huge huge disappointment.  A beautiful piece of music to meant to be played on ullean pipes, but this recording is NOT; it's a keyboard synth trying to sound like pipes; they don't..  The beauty of this Irish piece is the ethnic authenticity of the pipes and the building music with the strings.  Just no comparison when it's faked with a keyboard.  If you can, find a recording with Davey Spillane playing the pipes; it's magical. Tears will stream down your cheeks with the beauty of the melody and beautiful strings and pipe.",0

"The fun more than makes up for the lack of substance. This song was extremely big in the late 80s, early 90s. It's simple, but its synth beats and ""yodeling"" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!",1

Some of the songs I downloaded are some catchy and for some strange reason makes me want to listen to it every once in a while. The tracks ""morni belle belle"", which is the very first song I listened to from the raj album on youtube and ultimately decided to downloaded it the next day and some of the others I liked, ""jodi big day party"", and ""akh de Eshara"" are my most favorites. The track ""freaky like dat"" is quite a treat as well. Overall this cd or some of the songs is something that can be enjoyed by anyone who will take good notice of the orthodox combination of traditional indian instrumentation and vocals along with mainstream hip-hop and R&B music all blended into a wild adventurous but great concoction.",1
Happy Customer great music,1
"Payne in Your Ears! It's 1979 and the Disco trend is in full swing.  Every song on the radio features chants, funky basslines, percussive breakdowns and whistles.  Some performers of this genre of music could either make the transition to the Post-Disco format and some could not.  Thankfully, Payne DID with an underground hit in 1982 entitled, ""In Motion"" on Sutra Records.  Prior to that, her last outing was this, her Capitol swansong.

On ""Hot,"" Capitol seemed to have locked her into a chugging, Latin-flavored, Anita Ward-ish ""Ring My Bell"" sound with the first single, ""Red Hot,"" but there was only one problem- the only bell being rung was the gong.  This was NOT a reflection on Payne, but on Capitol, her label, with its typical lack of artist promotion.  If you're a fan of traditional Disco formats, this album may be for YOU.

Despite sexy photography, festive uptempos and beautiful balladry, this album as well as its two predecessors (""Supernatural High"" and ""Stares and Whispers"") didn't even touch the Disco/Dance chart.  All three titles are worth exploring and are highly recommended.  Additionally, you won't need any Q-Tips for THIS kind of Payne in your ears!

Here's a little trivia for ya TOO:  Prior to her signing with Capitol, who offered her a better financial option, she was offered a deal with Philadelphia International Records under Gamble & Huff.  Sadly, she didn't opt for the latter which just MIGHT HAVE proved the more beneficial choice for her career.  :-(",1

Rage Against the Machine and Sublime were heavily influenced by his Spanish punk crew Todos Tus Muertos.  He was in Mano Chao's band.  And now he's working with Puerto Rican reggaeton producers and cumbia/raverton DJs like Toy Selectah.

The music is still more reggae than anything else, though.  Feel good, knee bouncing Jamaican music en espanol ... songs for spliffs and baby making.  ""Te Robaste Mi Corazon"" is dangerously catchy.  High recommended!",1

"EXCELLENT! This band is the brainchild of Byron Duff,  a little-known guitar genius from Seattle. The sound is heavy, punky,jazzy, metallic and noisy all at the same time. Fans of everything from Sonic Youth grunge to the prog-rock of Robert Fripp will enjoy this.  This is alot more than dirges and depressing metal-based drudge.  It's raw but hypnotic.  There's touches of well-placed frantic sounds, but also VERY precise playing.  Totally unlike almost anything out there right now.  Maybe a more garage-y sounding Them Crooked Vultures.  EXCELLENT!",1
"Great Gospel Song Track A great accompaniment track for a very beautiful and inspiring song.  I first heard it at a funeral of a very good friend.  The words kept going over in my mind and I couldn't get them out.

Lord's prayer I did not care for this dvd. I was expecting something else and was not pleased. I usually like all of Rambo's songs but not this one,0
Simple song. Great Song. Beautiful Song. I love their voices.  Two beautiful voices with great lyrics.  I think most people will enjoy how harmonious and lyrical their voices are.,1
Fantastic! One of the greatest theme songs ever written! It's perfect for the show and the movies. And the orchestra does a great job performing it.,1
Do not waste your money rip off!!! These are NOT the actual singers singing the songs!! Do not waste your money!!,0
Download issues - was not able to listen Wasn't even able to download the album - waste of money.,0
Not happy with this selection I thought this would be traditional Christmas songs but they aren't. It is more classical and sung by choirs. Not happy with this selection.,0
"We Can't Live Here Any More James McMurtry Tells it Like Is..Whether You Like It or Not! His Words are Great, they are Today! I Think James is Great as Well as the Songs He Writes...We Need More of HIM!!!",1

"Classics to listen to over and over again I may be showing how old Ol' Ben really is by protesting that Big Band and Swing are not classical styles, not YET please!  But I expect most of my readers will consider music from the first half of a previous century as ""quaint.""  Even so, those of you out there who like music to have a tune as well as a beat will want to listen to these greats over and over again.",1

Has a Lot of Static This MP3 has an unexceptable amount of background static. This is the first Mp3 download that has had this problem of many I have purchases.,0
"What a catchy tune! We've been on a Celtic reel lately.  Motivated by some hits from the movie Brave (which my kids loved) we went in search of similarly sounding, upbeat instrumentals.  I use them to walk on the treadmill while my little ones dance around the room.  We find this one catchy and invigorating; it makes you want to dance. :)",1

"Remastered versions sound terrible I just downloaded the 2010 ""remastered"" version of the song ""With A Spirit"" from the album ""The Hits"", and I was shocked by the over compression. The song was completely smothered by pumping and wheezing effects due to poor compression techniques. Very unprofessional approach. Whoever remastered the song had NO IDEA what they were doing. Mastering is as much art as science, and tracks can get totally messed up if you do it wrong. Mastering is much more than just compression. And trust me, I am no GOLDEN EARS audiophile. The effect is VERY pronounced, and very detrimental to the quality of the song.

Because of the poor quality of the remastered version, I chose to download the original 2009 version of ""With A Spirit"" from the album ""009 Sound System"" to see if it might be better, and the difference was like night and day. The original version sounds much, much better. No extreme compression. No pumping and wheezing effect. Very good dynamics, with crisp highs and rich lows. Plus I was surprised to see that the bitrate of the original version mp3 was higher than the remastered version... 292 kbps for the original 2009 version as opposed to only 280 kbps for the 2010 remastered version.

Listening to them side by side, you can definitely hear a big difference. The remastered version sounds muddy and squished. The original sounds clear and dynamic. So definitely get the original 2009 version. It is a higher bitrate file, and just plain sounds better. It is 39 seconds shorter than the remastered version, but you hardly miss 39 seconds in a 10 minute song. DO NOT get the ""remastered"" version if you care about audio quality!",0
One Star Wouldn't let me use the song on face book,0

One Star It was an ok  song,0
"Not the ""Real"" Eric Andersen I bought this CD thinking the musician was the wonderful song writer/singer, author of Blue River and many other fine albums and songs. This is some young probably talented Billy Joel wannabe from Reno with his first CD. Neither the ad or the packaging have anything on them that suggest who this person is, which makes me suspicious. Disappointing; I was looking forward to something new from the ""original"" Eric Andersen.

Unusual yet gets everything in you thumping! This is an excellent dance and workout song! You have to move when you hear it if only in your mind! It always brightens my mood despite the subject. The musicians are genius!,1

beautiful to listen to I put one of these meditation albums on at night and it helps on relaxing and getting to sleep. I went back and got the other sones in the series of albums.  I find them very soothing,1
excellent job Hoyt Axton had a marvelous voice and did very well with this old blues song,1
"Great vocals I just don't seem to get tired of how tight the vocals are in this group. Nothing really new, however, it's just that simple consistent message we need to hear in gospel music from time to time.",1
"Sandler & Young are wonderful singers! Sandler & Young are a treat to listen to.

It's a shame that the last 5 songs on the CD are very distorted in sound.
How can these 5 songs be considered ""Digitally Remastered"" sounding so awful?

The first 8 songs are fine and have no obvious distortion.

Also, the CD has the songs in a different order from Amazon's song preview above.",0
Not sure whos to blame for qaulity! horrible!!!! This suppose to be remastered?  The sound quality sucks!  listen on youtube.,0
Great Encouraging Fun music with a message Great encouraging fun music. We use it when doing street crusades and for bike & skateboard tournaments before we minister. GoHarvesting.com,1
not properly labled It gives the appearance of the song being edited but it is full of profanity! I was very very disappointed.,0
Great old jazz instrumental. Great old jazz instrumental.,1
just as good live My fiance and I saw Ethan Tucker at a Slightly Stoopid concert recently and loved his music so we came home and bought this C.D. We are actually using one of his songs during our wedding reception.,1
"Really dreadful I bought the MP3 of this track as a pre-Christmas tongue-in-cheek gift for my wife, who thinks this may be the worst Christmas song in many years.  Alas, radio stations here in Iowa love to play it.  Oh well.  (I have nothing against Mulberry Lane, who appear to be lovely young women.  It's just a really awful song.)",0
"Intense prog/metal retelling of classic myth I first encountered Richard Campbell's work through the Rock Band video game, where his ""A Christmas Rock Medley"" was sold as an addon song for the game.  I loved the track and went looking for more.  I found Orpheus, listened to a few samples, and bought the album.

This has joined my list of favorite albums in just the few weeks I've had it.  It's a progressive rock concept album, like Rush's 2112 or Dream Theater's Metropolis Part 2.  It tells the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, a Greek myth about Orpheus, a legendary musician who marries a beautiful woman.  She is killed in an accident, and Orpheus goes to the underworld to beg the gods to return her to life.  Hades takes pity on him and agrees that he can have Eurydice back on the condition that he walk out of the underworld without looking behind him to see her face.  Orpheus leaves the underworld but looks back before Eurydice manages to join him, and she is condemned to the underworld.  A short snippet of another myth is brought in--Orpheus is killed by Thracians--and the chorus closes the tale.

The instrumentals are all performed by Campbell, who is veritable polymath of music: he plays drums, guitar, keyboard, and bass on this album.  He also wrote the arrangements, as well, and his enjoyment of Dream Theater shines through here; this album may not be as complicated as a typical DT track, but it could easily be mistaken for a side project from any of the members of DT.

Watch the preview on YouTube at[...] and decide for yourself if this is what you want.",1
"Da! it is a good album! Zhasmin CD Da!  First the tracks:

7. As Always

There are also two videos: Most Beloved and Da!  Unfortunately I could not load the videos on a computer (W7 or XP).  My IT friend at word checked the disk and said the videos were saved in an older, not supported format.  Oh well.

This album has a lot of good tracks on it, my favorites are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 12.  I also liked 6 and 13.

The CD is packaged a little differently, kind of a booklet form with some nice pictures of Zhasmin and a lot of text, but you better know Cyrillic to read it.

All in all, if you're a Zhasmin fan, it's a good album.",1
Dmitri Ratser CD. Top of the Top! Dmitri Ratser is one of the best pianists in the today's world! The way he plays is absolutely the best of Russian piano school. I wish we could buy EVERYTHING he plaid in his lifetime. Unfortunately we could find this CD only. Long life and great health to this unique master! Thanks Dmitri!,1
Love it Wonderful rock song to sing along to in the car with the windows rolled down! Nothing much else to say.,1
Terrible. Absolutely terrible I wish I would have read the other people's reviews before purchasing it.  A bunch of karaoke caliber covers.  Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.,0
"Not correct The vast majority of these songs are cover bands. The rest are either a single member of the original band re-recording the song without the rest of the band, or they are poorly done recordings. Avoid this album, only about 6 or 7 of them are worth listening to.",0
"Thoroughly pathetic attempt to reproduce great songs I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, I could get around 20 of the 100 songs to be to my liking.  Silly me.  There are only about 7 that are worth listening to for someone who has listened to the originals.  Waste of money unless you have never heard the original bands.",0

"Less than great voices The music is excellent, , ,but what is advertised is NOT what is on the CD.  And I have all of the same songs on other CDs.  The cover art is not even the same.  Obviously one company made the CD, another did the art work and content brochure, neither talked to each other and the quality control department had the day off.  Then I paid Amazon charged $19.99 for something I already had.",0
"Future Classic Christmas Album Anyone who is a fan of good Classic Christmas music would adore this album! Does not disappoint, stand outs are ""Mary Did You Know"" and ""Carol of the Bells"" for starters.

"Kid Rock Singing Country Rock or Rock Country Started listening to Kid Rock after he did ""Redneck Paradise"" with Hank W. Jr. ( which is also a five star or six ). If you like his earlier music ( read that as Rap ), you might not like this. Like his raspy voice and his love of America. Regardless, it's worth a listen as is ""Times Like These"". Makes you a bit misty eyed. Just give it a try if you like a mix of country and rock or just rock or country.",1

"Another New Seekers Greatest Hits Mix Considering that the New Seekers recording career spanned some twelve plus years its a pity that this new release is the same reissue under a new guise of last times greatest hits and the time before that.........
This is the pleasing mix of the New Seekers material that those who rememebr them will expect to find but it doesn't show the wider range of their music or vocal dexterity.  The recordings cover the prime 1970 to 1974 period and feature the Marty, Eve, Paul, Peter [Doyle]and Lyn line up. A few tracks recorded in 1973 and 1974 have Peter [Oliver] replacing his name sake who quit the band in 1973.
The mix of Circles is a horrible rehersal style mix where music and vocals simply don't blend and I can only think Polydor must have lost the excellent verson that was originally released.
Beg, Steal or Borrow was hardly the New Seeker's greatest hit although it brought them internaational recognition as the UK 1972 Eurovision Song Contest entry.  The excellent B side to that original single One by One features on this CD as do a few lesser known album tracks Brother Loves Travelling Salvation Show with lead vocal by Peter Oliver and the enjoyable frothy Dance Dance Dance - the first NS album track I ever heard nearly thirty years ago.
All together a happy journey down memory lane but the New Seekers music deserves a more ambitious compilation next time.

"One of the Greatest Songs Ever Written Say what you want about Southern Rock, redneck rock or whatever you want to call it. Molly Hatchet were one of the best overlooked bands from the late 70's and early 80's. This tune is an all time classic and one of the best songs ever written. The problem with this version is that it is not the original version. It is a re-recorded version that does not have Danny Joe Brown singing. Crappy re-mixing and I do NOT advise anyone to purchase this abomination. If you want to real song, you will have to find it somewhere else.",0
Five Stars great traveling music,1
BEAUTIFUL! !!! Awesome awesome awesome! !!!!!!!,1
"Disappointed I'm not sure how the wording of the song was originally written but my church sings the part of the ocean meeting the sky like ""a beautiful kiss"" rather than this artist's version of ""a wet sloppy kiss.""

"Blending two groups into one! Pete Anders and Vinnie Poncia were prolific songwriters in the '60s and produced many of the Kama Sutra releases during that era which included their own performances under the names ""The Tradewinds"" and ""The Innocence.""  They never toured or performed live as such, so these names were simply a foil to release their own material directly, rather than through other artists they were producing. Despite their generous output as writers, the biggest hit they had was ""New York is Lonely Town"" which only reached #33 on the Billboard charts. Kama Sutra records went bankrupt in the late '60s, the remnants of which morphed into Buddhah Records. The Tradewinds original vinyl LP, ""Excursions"" was very short in playing time, just over 12"" a side. In order to extend it to a more acceptable length for CD release, it now includes two tracks by The Good Times. Still, it only clocks in at just over 28"", which is very short for a CD.  Although produced by Anders and Poncia, The Good Times are a different group entirely from the Tradewinds.  (I should know, my brother, Tim, was the lead guitarist.) They had two singles on Kama Sutra and an unreleased album that was largely produced by the Anders-Poncia team.  On this Tradewinds CD, Pete and Vinnie wrote each track, including ""The Hard Life,"" but not ""That's When Your Heartaches Begin"", an old Elvis tune.  Although they produced this track, and Vinnie played piano on it, they neither wrote this song nor sang on it. These two tracks, along with ""New York's a Lonely Town"", are in mono, not stereo.  They may have been taken from the vinyl records, rather than the original masters. In my opinion, it would have been better to release the Tradewinds album and Innocence album together as a ""two for one"" combination for those interested in the Anders-Poncia writing team. That would have been a better value, and more honest.  In any case, The Good Times album, originally scheduled for release as KLPS 8052, remains in the vaults.",0
Poor Quality Download Terrible quality. So disappointed in this download. I rarely purchase a single download but I didn't want to purchase the entire album just for this one song. Thankfully it only cost a dollar but even that was too much based on the quality of the recording.,0

However, I was extremely disappointed by the turn which the Vienna Boys' Choir seems to have taken.  The last four tracks (Nothing Compares to You, Eternal Flame, Burning Down the House and Only Time) are not at all in keeping with the great tradition this choir is known for.  These tracks, especially the ones by Prince and Talking Heads, are, in my opinion, deplorable.  These tracks should not be on this album at all, I don't think.  Choirboys from Heaven???

"Music Banned By The nazis This CD is an introductory CD to a whole series of some 25 produced by Michael Haas and recorded and released by Decca.  I think it's one of the most important things that's happened in classical music recording in the past 20 years.  That's because Haas is a real scholar, and he has gone to great lengths to make this series as thorough as his Decca budget would allow, and to record music by a wide variety of composers  -- some who made it and some who didn't.  In fact, if you become interested in this topic, as I did, Haas has recently released an excellent book on this topic, published by Yale, I think.

The performances are all strong. This CD gives you short cuts by lots of composers, not complete works.  But it gives you an idea of the incredible richness of the (mostly Jewish) musical scene in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and early 1930's.",1

"The lessons GM DIDN'T learn from Toyota This is an hour-long story about an improbable partnership between General Motors and Toyota to jointly run an auto plant in Fremont, California. The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010.  It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., but everyone called it ""NUMMI."" It's a fascinating narrative, with interviews of workers, labor leaders, management from the plant and business school faculty.  This is one of the best radio pieces you'll ever hear.  Although the two companies were fierce competitors, each needed the other at the time.  GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently.  Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here.  Toyota chose GM's Fremont assembly plant, which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country.  Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs, sex, intentional sabotaging of cars, absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers, and constant labor-management fights.  Contrary to almost everyone's advice, Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry.  These blue-collar, hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way.  Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation.  Almost from the day it opened, the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S.  Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America.  During its lifetime, the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars, mostly Toyota Corollas.  This program tells how this transformation was accomplished, why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way (ultimately leading to GM's bankruptcy).  The story is told by Frank Langfit in a joint production by NPR and WBEZ/This American Life.",1
I loved this song when I heard it in the video ... I loved this song when I heard it in the video game trailer on youtube and the version by Peter Hollins and Malukah but in this version the guys singing it were really flat throughout the song.,0
"Great medley of Halo themes This montage definitely is more for those people who didn't play Halo just for it's multiplayer aspect, but more for those people who enjoyed the story line.  If you're the type of person who enjoyed the story line of Halo, and the musical themes for each of the characters and scenarios, then this is for you.  If you just liked Halo to shoot others, then this probably isnt.  :-)",1
Very Positive I love this song. It reminds our young African American population that they are special no matte what is being said or portrayed out in the media,1
"I hate it. This is a cheesy version which does not have the same music at all. Of course she's singing the same lyrics, but the clip on Amazon Music masks that it's not the old-school version. I hate it.",0

"Save your money and spare your ears. Just listen to ""Hidden Away"" and move on. Others have said this is his best? I wholeheartedly DISAGREE. When I purchased this, it was because I already had two of his other CD's, and I loved both of them. (There was one song on each of those CD's that I didn't like, so I assumed I would like nearly all of these ones, too.) Wish I had bothered to listen to the tracks here on Amazon first. I would have saved myself the money. The only song on this whole CD that I liked was ""Hidden Away.""  Everything else was Josh's gorgeous voice, singing craptacular lyrics. Oh, except for the first track... that doesn't even have Josh SINGING on it. (When I buy a CD by a renowned VOCALIST, I expect to get his voice in every single song. Unpleasant surprise here.)

I used to think that Josh would sound good, even if he were singing in Pig Latin.  This CD proves me wrong. He still has a gorgeous voice, no matter what he sings, but I just could not get past the terrible lyrics or the odd-sounding arrangements.",0

"A bit lackluster and disappointing... As one of Michael W. Smith's biggest fans, and also a bluegrass affectionado, when I saw this in the store the other day I was genuinely excited.  However, I have been pretty disappointed in what I've heard. Overall, the album is lackluster and has an ""easy-listening"" feel to it.  Secondly, there are no vocals, and MWS' music really isn't his without them.  Thirdly, there are at least five tracks on the album that aren't even MWS songs.  Sure, MWS recorded ""Awesome God,"" but if I were Rich Mullins, I'd be offended that one of his most famous songs is on an MWS tribute album, since it was him that made it famous and not Smith.  The same goes for ""Breathe"" and ""Above All"", which MWS recorded, but are not necessarily ""associated"" with him.  All it would have taken was to poll some fans before hitting the studio and this would have been avoided.

On the plus side, the music is extremely meditative, as I alluded to with my ""easy listening"" comment.  Therefore, it makes for good calming ambiance music. If that's what you're looking for, you'll not be disappointed, but for authentic MWS and authentic bluegrass, look elsewhere.",0
"You can't be serious Most of this album from what he did in the last five years and that what they calling the greatest. Without ""No Reasonable Doubts"" tracks this collection will never complete. It's not that songs are bad I just feel they didn't put his best body of work together.",0

"Ne-Yo's Musical Talents Shines Here Absolute perfection, I am very selective about my music and the artist, every track is featured on my playlist, that doesn't happen very often. Ne-Yo definitely knocked it out of the ball park with this album, generated some pretty slick music videos too.",1

would not suggest The song was over rated the sound quality was terrible the volume was set low on the album itself so even with a booster it was low I simply wasn't impressed,0
"Kanye is to music what Kim Kardashian is to television. There was a brief moment in time where I liked Kanye's music and bought this song. Then I realized he is a giant d-bag and represents everything that is wrong with modern hip-hop. Kanye is to music what Kim Kardashian is to television, utterly devoid of meaning or purpose. Steer clear of this garbage and go support some good music like Atmosphere, Grieves, Tupac, or Logic.",0

"not the someday from the movie Knight and Day I have looked everywhere to find the song Someday from the movie Knight and Day, also by black eyed pea, they even have it on you tube with tom Cruise on the stage while they sang it. Not saying this is a bad song,its
 just not the same  and I can't find the one from the movie and that is disappointing.",0
"Objectionable lyrics I bought the song because of the beat.  I had heard the song at the skate rink and I liked the groove.  The 30 second sample does not show the rap part of the song.  After  I bought it and really listened to it, I was disgusted by it.  Too bad because it is a great dance track.  He had to mess it up with vile rap lyrics.  Even though I paid for it I deleted them from my mp3 player, computer and my amazon cloud.  Next time I am going to use YouTube.com to listen to the full versions first before buying.",0
"BEP have done it again! Watch out everyone! The Black Eyed Peas have done it again!!

If you are like me and just love music with catchy beats that makes you want to just get up and move, either dance or jump or get moving, you are always looking for the dance hit that will make you jump of your chair and get you going.

This is one of those that no matter how old, it will ALWAYS make you move and put a smile on your face! But are we really surprised?? Heck no!

From the very first time I heard this song I was hooked! Before I even knew who the artist was, and after finding it was the BEP, all I could think was: ""-But of course!-""

The BEP have a way to make their music be liked by all ages! Just picture a car where there are 6 people, 41, 13, 8, 34, & 12 years old, and all of them singing at the top of their lungs! That's what pretty much happens every time the whole family is in the car and the song comes up! Boys, girls, men, women, everyone is just taken over by the beat!",1
"Disappointing... Man, this song is bad, and I like the singles from ""The E.N.D."" Its like 2 totally separate songs that they just mashed together, with no thought invested in how to transition from one part to the other effectively.  Just lazy, and one of the biggest mainstream pop disappointments of the year IMO.",0
"A good tune This song is good.  Not a classic or the greatest of all time, but a very good tune that is easy to listen too.",1
crap Dog S*** song. Absolutely terrible! I knew Kanye was worthless but this song is worse than anything I've ever purchased on Amazon,0
"Edited Version still has the A_ _ word in the song. 5 Stars for great music - 2 Stars for bad word left in

Great energizing song that makes you just want to keep going.  However, even though it is edited and the nasty words are out you still can't play it in your car with the kids as the word A _ _ is left in.  Clean means ""Clean"" got it editors.  Now I got to go in and edit it myself.  Lose 3 stars for the inconvenience to still edit my own song.",0

Very disappointing.",0
"Crowbar49 This is not the song I was expecting. I will read the reviews before I purchase next time. Not Amazon's fault but very disapointing. I wanted the song at the end of the Movie -""Knight and Day"" and this is not it. The Black Eyed Peas or the movie producers are ripping people off. Live and learn.",0
"Someday OST it IS NOT!! I downloaded this, after listening to the ""snippet"" sample"" online, only to find that this was NOT the same version that appears at the end of the movie, ""Knight & Day"", in fact....it's NOTHING like it!  I am not a big fan of this group, and basically I downloaded the MP3 d/l because of the fantastic guitar work that appeared in the movie version....absent here, so don't waste you money d/l this, thinking it's something which it clearly is not!  It appears that the ""full"" version of this song isn't availble on the BEP disc ""The Beginning"" OR on the OST recording?!?!? WHY NOT record label people?",0
I hated this track XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX X This is a a lousy music  track. Don't bother. It blows big!,0
Five Stars Great,1
"Currently my least favorite song I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod.  It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive.  Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being ""my"") head for days after it's been heard.  It's worse than ""It's A Small World After All.""  Perhaps it's the familiarity of the ""Time Of My Life"" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise.  I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the love of all that is good in the world, pick something else.",0
Five Stars Ronald Isley is wonderful,1
"Mr. Isley's first solo CD album as a solo artist without the Isley Brothers band. His debut album is very good. His first single ""No More"" is the best one since he recorded back in fall of 2009 after completing his three year prison term in Terre Haute and two years living in a halfway house in St. Louis. His album gains a lot of popularity on his comeback for the first time since his three year absence from the music industry. After he did just one album with Geffen along with the collaboration with rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris and with ""The Legendary Queen of Soul"" Miss Aretha Franklin, He went on to sign with eOne Music and released ""This Song is for You"" in 2013 and released his two hit singles ""My Favorite Thing"" w/Kem and ""Dinner and a Movie"".",1
Junk Kanye West claims to be suffering for his art. I assure you it's nothing compared to the pain of having to endure the noise he tries to pass off as music.,0
"Young pop-punk singer is far from a ""Ghost""! Fefe Dobson is dynamic and far from any ""Ghost"" with this particular song! She delivers all her trademark fiery energy and appeal which is undeniably reminiscent of the early work of my other favorite singer and her contemporary Avril Lavigne. Dobson showcases her good vocals and alternative rock here quite well like she did with her self-titled debut album. If you never heard of this talented and fearless singer Fefe Dobson, I recommend getting a copy of her first album which is top-notch. Good job, Fefe Dobson!",1

"Disappointment deserving of better Sadly, a disappointment.  This is a charming work by the late Enlightenment polymath Francois-Andre Danican Philidor (1726-1795). From a musical family, he started as a choir boy in the Chapelle Royale, and continued to rise in the King's musical service.  But while performing and composing, Philidor apparently learned the game of chess, and over a number of years, rose up to become Europe's greatest chess player.  And Philidor was no slouch at composing either (mostly opera-comique) during the era of Gluck, Monsigny, and Gretry in Paris. ""Le Sorcier""is a two-act work, a kind of Singspiel in French (no recitative, just spoken dialogue) somewhat in the folk-opera style of Rousseau's ""La devin du village"" from a decade earlier. The premiere of ""Le Sorcier"" in Paris in 1764 was moderately successful, and the very young Mozart was in town at the time; it's possible that ""Le Sorcier"" could have influenced Mozart in his own young Singspiel composing.

The problem here is the performance.  It's.....awful. (It pains me to say that.)  The singing is the main culprit:  sopranos wobble all over the place, and tenors sometimes can't even reach up to hit the notes they're supposed to.  The orchestral work, while not as bad, is nothing memorable. The excuse that this is a provincial group (the Orchestre de Rennes) doesn't fly; in classical-performer-rich Europe, even local groups can often turn in excellent performances, and there might even be a few U.S. university groups that could do better than this.  The one minor positive here is that, since all the performers are French, pronunciation during the spoken dialogue is excellent.  Indeed, one occasionally gets the impression that the performers believed they were putting on a play with music segments.

But ""Le Sorcier"" is a fun, saucy work that is worthy of a better recording.  This is the ideal kind of work for Ryan Brown and his Opera Lafayette, who've turned in several excellent performances of works from this period.",0

"oh, no. I was really excited to hear Sam Beam's newest creation mostly after seeing him live this fall and getting a preview of the upcoming album.  I took note when he covered ""Such Great Hights"" and instantly fell in love with his voice.

Walking Far from Home is a brilliant track that finally seems to give Sam a voice instead of the whisper we all know and love.  And what a voice!  Even though the song is amazing, this track seems to be a little over mastered.  And sadly that continues to the other two.
Summer in Savannah when played live has such depth to its sound.  Over-mastered and flat sound on the recording.
Hearing Biting your Tail this way scares me.

There is something big that these recordings are missing. I really hope that Sam Beam comes out with a LIVE ALBUM soon to show the world these songs' true colors and sound.",0

I agree The song was lovely and perfect exactly as it was.  I was so disappointed when I heard the download sample.  Tragic.,0
"ruined a great song this song appears to be a ""remix"" of a really good Sweet Talk Radio Song...redo is a strange term, listed to the sample, it just seems like someone added a cheesy drum track ruining the song",0
"Just what I was looking for My house is next to 4 lanes of major-street traffic, and to mask the sound at night, others have suggested I get a box fan.  For the volume of a box fan's noise that I'd need, I didn't want the air flow that came with it.  I've tried a stand-alone white noise machine, but that particular one wasn't loud enough to mask anything, even on its highest volume.  So I looked for a CD of white noise or box fan sound effect.  Until I started looking, I didn't realize there were other ""colors"" of noise.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It has a deeper or lower tone than white noise, so it doesn't sound as harsh, IMO.  I just wish I'd've found this cheap solution before I bought a box fan and a white noise machine!  I can still use the box fan, but the white noise machine is history now that I have this.",1

Two Stars The end of the track is cut off.,0
"Break out the holy water!  This thing is righteous! This thing is as uplifting as they come!  I couldn't sit still, I had to dance the entire album through.

My favorite track is 'March of the Clowns', a touching story of the trials and tribulations of a boy named Josh discovering that he doesn't need to be intoxicated to be entertaining, no matter what his Godless friends say.

Another favorite is 'Panda's Need Love Too'.  A tale of a panda named Andy who is searching for his soul mate but can only manage to find heathenist prostitutes.

I'd highly recommend this to anyone who needs to reaquaint their spirit with God's joy.",1

Five Stars Good music!,1
It's not at all what I wanted. This an ... It's not at all what I wanted.  This an extended disco version with the song sung in the middle of a long string of guitar and instrumentals and percussion.  Somewhere out there is a long version done by the Beach Boys themselves.  I heard on SiriusXM but can't even find it on you tube.,0
"Heavenly I heard this song about 3 years ago and absolutely loved it.  Such as inspirational song, speaking of the GOD that we serve.  He's simply awesome and this songs proclaims that.!",1
One Star Very disappointed! This was labeled as clean and most definitely IS NOT CLEAN! Returning immediately!,0
DO NOT BUY VINYL BUY DIGITAL One of my favorite albums but the vinyls are all warped. My order was warped. They replaced it. The replacement was warped. Unless you wanna put in the work to unwarp it just buy a cd or download,0

Pretty Song! Let My Heart Dance is very pretty! David and Nicole is just phenomenal! They really touch you with this song.,1
Sweet Worship Awesome! It ushers you right into the Presence of God!!!,1
"Love it The music is excellent, uplifting,places your soul and spirt in a worshiping frame of mind. Would recommend to any one.",1
However David Binion is an awesome For me it is ok. Just not what I expected. I guess it's a matter of personal appeal. However David Binion is an awesome artist,0
Orson welles deserves better than this. Terrible sound quality.,0
"Audio quality just horrible I have other old recordings that have been recovered and they are WAY better than whoever did these. I got these for my wife for the car, completely useless since the audio quality is SO BAD she can't follow along - myself too. Someone needs to grab the originals and do it properly. It's a shame.",0
Filipino Rose My grandmother used to turn this song on when I was little and we would dance around her kitchen to it. It is so beatiful and melancholy.,1
"Great Song of Invitation to The Lord This song gives an invite to everyone who wants The Lord more than anything else in your life; Not only do you want yourself to be in The  Holy Presence Of The Lord, but you want to get as many people as possible to also enter through that door!  You just want to get as many on board before it's too late!  God sees what's happening down here upon the earth, and The Lord is more active about it than we can ever imagine or understand!  This song gives you a strong desire to reach out in The Spirit Of The Lord to others throughout the 4 corners of the earth!  God Bless your Heart as you continue to worship in The Name Of The Lord!",1
Five Stars Good music from a good band of the past,1
"Jimmy Shand, so what else can you say? It is played by Jimmy Shand, so one can not say anything more.  There are a number of recordings of this dance, all in strict tempo, and some have better sound, but Shand is the standard.",1
Five Stars Nice,1
Bad recording My copy sounds distorted and as though it was recorded from an LP with clicks and pops.  Am going to complain,0
"A Must Have!! This interpretation of Flamingo is simply the best! With the genius of Jimmy Smith on organ and the great Lee Morgan on trumpet, this classic is nothing short of amazing! The arangement simply sublime.",1
Five Stars A classic. Need i say more??,1
Doris is one of my favorites! Pity her choice ... Doris is one of my favorites!  Pity her choice of songs leave a lot to be desires.  I can now chose from this album.,1
"Love the show Love the show, and the broadcast is fascinating, but this version plays back at a speed that's slightly too fast, thus raising the voices, throwing off the pacing, and messing with the music.  Better off buying it on CD from OTRCAT where the quality is much better.",0
"Enlisted Men's Mess Glenn Miller I have never heard of this song, but I love it. Songs from the Big Band Era are fun to listen to. It's what makes that era alive.",1
"Beware This is not the full version, beware.",0
"A mediocre recording I don like the sound quality of the recording. It's noisy, like ef it was recorded from a used 33 RPM vynil record.",0
Not worth it I want my money back only 1 good song but only well.,0
Great Basic Cha Cha Tune A great basic Cha Cha tune. A simple straight forward clearly defined beat which makes it ideal for those learning the basic steps of the dance.,1

"great music this is a great CD for kids, tweens and kids church.  Yancy rocks! good mix of high energy and slow worshipful songs",1
very poor recording Very poor recording. Buzzing on all the high notes.,0
"Zen Radio - Perfect song? There's something to be said for an artist that still knows how to create imagery and take us on a guided tour of their inner workings and while they're at it, our own. At the first listen I said to my wife, ""Hey it's a new Neil (Young) song!"". Honestly, Mr. Will Clay does sound so eerily like Neil Young you almost can't believe that it isn't Neil. But, with as little as i know about the artist, I realized that it was more like a progressive version of Ole' Coyote Eyes (Neil) rather than a 'cop' of Neil's deal. What I did find out, I learned through Jango.com where Will has more than 1 song listed, thankfully (check it out, and while you're at it, check out Will Clay's song called 'Little Horn'...it's so real and spookey that it spun me back around again to the premise of Neil Young's 'Tonight's the Night' when he sings about the roadie with the ""'shakey voice...that sent a chill up and down'"" Neil's spine. That's the same chill that I get when I listen to Will Clay. Whoever Mr. Clay really is, I can't help but regard him as a true 'unknown legend'. Let's hear more!!! Some one needs to lasso this guy and get him into a studio, PRONTO! Geez!!",1
The price was good.. Low quality recordings. The price was good... that was why.,0
Wow - what a voice. All I can say is WOW,1
Takes me back This song is great!!! This Song really takes me back to the good old days of church music and praise!!!,1
Love it. Just listen to sample for yourself Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Love it. Just listen to sample for yourself.,1
"hits home!!! 5 stars Rob Mehl's song ""Waiting for Jimmy""  hits home for me.  I have been to Key West several times over the past years and have ALWAYS been a Buffett fan.  This song speaks to me and all of my memories of the Keys.  Great music lets great memories flow!!",1
good song saint is a good band not many people know of them but thier music is good and they are a rock band,1
Great to relax A coworker of mine introduced me to these guys and they kind of turned into the office sound track for us. It's fantastic music to listen to to wind down to. The lyrics are sincere and real. The melodies are intoxicating. Totally recommend this album. I would pay good money to see them live but they'll never come to Texas.,1
"Lots of music for the price Good collection. I would not call it the best. Some of the songs are not truly Bhajans but are more classical.
Pros:
1. Lots to listen to. A large collection. In fact, takes a while getting to know all the songs.
2. Some of the songs are well done - in synch with the rest of the collection
Cons:
1. Some of the bhajans have been picked from other collections and do not synch up with the rest of the songs.
Overall a great collection, unlike the ones you get on CDs.",1
Didn't work for me The MP3 didn't work for me to relax. The voice was not hypnotic or relaxing at all. I wouldn't recommend it.,0
"One Recording to rule them all! Being the President of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association, sometimes I take a hit for the team. That's fine. Bring on Rene Jacobs and his Freiburg Barockorchestra! Man-Permer brood of conductors (Rattle, Dudamel and Ticciati) - do your worst! But beyond good and evil and whatever bell curves you care to nominate, there lies the domain of Maximiano Cobra, the Sauron of his profession and breaker of nations. Exposition and developmental repeats, invariably observed, are his Nazgl. Who has the wherewithal to withstand his onslaughts? There are reports that Saddam Hussein loaded up on his discography as WMDs - and indeed, the Scuds that were fired off at Israel in the First Gulf War had their warheads removed and replaced with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-S-Bach-Die-Kunst-Der-Fuge-The-Art-of-Fugue-Bwv/dp/B003O9I0YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J.S. Bach-Die Kunst Der Fuge-The Art of Fugue Bwv</a>. Should Cobra wear the blame for Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent barbarism that ensued? Could be.

Here, he annihilates K 550. Not one stone is left upon another. Brace yourself. As Selina says in The Dark Knight Rises, ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.""

First movement - 13'56""
Second Movement - 25'07"" (verily, this is ground zero).
Minuet 9'38""
Finale - 19'46""

I think that Cobra is using the second version. With steam coming out of my ears, I cannot say for sure. The development in the finale of K 550 is reputed to represent someone going mad. Evidence is now at hand - just look in the mirror!

I was once a member of the Old Firm. It's not about moral judgments or existential bets anymore. Jesus and the Blessed Virgin can only do so much. I'm beyond that. My old allegiances have been burnt away. Bear Grylls is now my god - praised be his holy name!

Insofar as I'm still capable of thought, here's Uncle Karl B&ouml;hm at his funereal worst (Vienna Philharmonic):

First Movement - 8'55""
Second Movement - 8'07""
Minuet - 5'11""
Finale - 4'58""

Man, as Dean Moriarty would exclaim, that's Paradise at the end of the road!

There have been some suggestions that MC's orchestra is computer generated. I do not believe that for one second. An investigative journalist (Bob Woodward) once told me that its constituents spent time in the Soviet Gulag - indeed, most of them broke bread with Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the camps beyond the Arctic Circle. Trust me: they should have stayed there.

To add to the terror, one ""George Schatzkamer"" (remember his name when the wolves howl at night) routinely claims on Amazon that Cobra is the equal of ""Furtw&auml;ngler, Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Mengelberg (and) Golovanov."" Under normal circumstances, I'm not a conspiracy buff but I wonder whether this Seinfeld-inspired figure is hardwired to Cobra himself.

In the remains of the day, one contemplates the half-life of Plutonium-244, the Great Dying of the Permian extinction event and the loss of legions in the Teutoburg forest. I can do all these things - and more - if you stand by me.",0
Two Stars Was disappointed to find this was a later issue not on the original label. Also two of the cuts skipped.,0
Not good for quiet prayer time Got to be in the mood for old time rock-n-roll. Not good for quiet prayer time.,0
"A pretty good re-recording of a classic anime theme. For those of you old enough to remember the Rumiko Takahashi anime Maison Ikkoku, this song will sound spooky familiar. That's because this is a ""21st Century Version"" of the show's original opening title theme, titled ""Hello! Sadness"" in the United States. Both the original version and this new recording are performed by Saito Yuki.

The original song was released in 1986, with this version being released in 2007. That's a 21 year gap, guys and girls. Ignoring for a moment how old that makes me feel, I have to confess that I wasn't initially very keen on the new version. There's definitely a lot of nostalgia tied to the original recording, but that's not the only problem. 1980s J-pop has a very particular kind of sound, one that I grew fond of over my many viewings of Japanese anime from the era. There are some great synth elements to the original recording of ""Hello! Sadness"" that are simply missing from the new arrangement, with new elements being added in for flourish (such as the occasional touch of electric guitar). I suppose this was done to give it a more modern feeling.

After getting over the initial nostalgia shock, I really grew to appreciate the new recording. Saito's performance is still relaxed and beautiful, and the new arrangement is  just as moving now as the original was then. I sort of wish the album would have included the original cut as well -- you can't currently find it for sale on Amazon -- but that aside, the song is well worth it if you like melodic J-pop or were a fan of Maison Ikkoku.",1
Awesome Song This is a great song for ATS. It's a lot of fun to dance to and can really get an audience pumped up.,1
Five Stars Amazing long ambient work by Max Corbacho.,1
"The RajMan Review Rick Cutler's latest collection of piano instrumentals is a moody and evocative affair worthy of the album's equally atmospheric title and cover.

The 18 tracks contained on the CD are very cinematic in feel, which should come as no surprise since Cutler writes and performs music for film and television. He also served as Gregory Hines's keyboardist and musical director for 18 years and currently tours as Liza Minnelli's drummer, and has also worked with scores of other notable artists in between, giving Cutler an edge as a brilliant composer and a seasoned musician.

Cutler is a crafty tunesmith, always drawing you in with captivating hooks, sometimes giving you what you anticipate, and other times taking you in unexpected directions, yet leaving you musically satisfied. The compositions, which include tips of the hat to such classical and jazz influences as Debussy and McCoy Tyner, are subtle and understated and function as a sort of tonic for the psyche.

Interspersed throughout the album are three ""Alien Landscapes"" that exemplify Cutler's simultaneously adventurous and eerie sensibilities. With the CD as a whole, Cutler has definitely cultivated an artistically and intellectually stimulating sonic landscape for inner reflection and deep reverie.",1
"If you like.... If the names Nujabes, Fat Jon, or Emancipator are familiar to you, then this is right up your alley. Very chill",1
"Warning! Some songs are so bad they're almost good. This isn't one of them. ""A Real Man"" is simply awful and Agnes-Nicole's voice is so annoying it pisses me off. I wish these so-called ""Hollywood wives"" would stay away from things they know nothing about and leave room for people with actual talent.",0

"Seriously hip-hop fans, this is the ultimate of hidden gems Shabazz the disciple, former member of the SUNZ OF MAN and guest apps on many WU affiliated lps.  Why this album is frankly the best hip-hop Iv'e heard in yrs is: He speaks the truth of the streets, spits knowledge, of corrupt government and raps about the truth of slaves and the killing of the indians too his daughters. Nobody has copped this yet, really? Between each song there is a history lesson as well as paying tribute to MLK, Malcom X and Huey P, which rolls and blends amazingly into the next bombtrack. You WILL NOT THANK me enough if you get this.  It's been in my rotation for nearly a year. Hell Razah also guest stars along with Canadian producer DJ Extremediz. GET IT!",1

"Ripoff - get one of the other CDs Ripoff! What a waste only putting 10 songs on a CD! There are more complete Fiedler Christmas CDs. I suggest Pops Christmas Party and A Christmas Festival (though there is some overlap of the two). Or even, Christmas at the Pop's Greatest Hits.

"Prayers from the Heartland Gail's voice has been beautiful in song for many years. Her unique ability to capture in lyrics the highs and lows of life and love in a deeply spiritual way are proven true in her first CD, ""Prayers from the Heartland."" Her lyrics are included in the CD, and are poetry to read. Her partner in singing, David Chaidez, blends in his rich tonal's with Gail's lilting, floating grace notes. Grace in the deeper sense of the word. The 8th track, ""One Woman's Song for Love"", is especially beautiful to me. Those seeking heartfelt wisdom and beauty in words and song cannot go wrong with this CD.",1

Stop your Depression self hypnosis The music in this song would come in really strong to where you couldn't hear the person speaking and then it would go really soft and be in the background. The music was very distracting from what the speaker was saying so you didn't really get anything out of the session. Very disappointing overall. I wish I would have known before I bought I wouldn't have wasted my time with this song.,0
"broken My record arrived broken.  I do not know if it broke during transportation, or before it was even sent. It was cheap however so I got over it in a couple of days.",0
"Not to my taste I had heard the opening fragment of the first track 'Red House' somewhere and thought this promises to be an interesting, modern, arrangement of an eighteenth-century country dance. Buying the CD proved to be a big disappointment.  It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in, to my mind, a rather sickly fashion, where all the musicians must play something, however fragmented, all the time.  The pianist comes in for most of the blame here, vigorously scaling, arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned.  There is an overall impression of improvisation which, praiseworthy when done well, often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect.  Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout.  The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled, but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance.  String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo.  It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be OK.  Inevitably, the rhythms suffer, indeed, are sometimes lost in this jumble.  As a country dancer of nearly 40 years experience I have survived many dances where live music has failed to live up to its expectation: this is the first commercially produced CD of country dance music I have bought which leaves me with the same feelings.",0
"Christianity Today reviews Through the Open Door Michael Milton
Through the Open Door (Music For Missions)
Released January 2011
Robert Ham
Style: Acoustic folk/country; compare to Neil Young, Steven Curtis Chapman, Dan Fogelberg

Top tracks: ""Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,"" ""Mississippi-Louisiana Line,"" ""The Gadarene""

Is there anything Michael Milton can't do? He's written numerous books, leads the Reformed Theological Seminary, and hosts a Bible study program on DIRECTV. And he has now released three CDs of plaintive spiritual folk that are musically opulent and emotionally stirring. Milton and his collaborators--including singer/songwriter Michael Card--have crafted an uncommonly varied set of songs, ably tackling bluegrass, lite rock, and country. It skews too heavily on the side of mellow, leisurely paced material, but still pulls off some unexpected moments like the arresting strings and piano that mark the closing track, ""Eclogue for the Church Triumphant,"" which, heard free of Milton's reading from Revelations 21:5, reminded me of no less than the Lou Reed/John Cale collaboration Songs for Drella.

"Sparkling Performance Absolutely the best recorded performance of ""Gaite Parisienne"".  It bubble and sparkles like no other recorded performance.  Quality of the recording might be considered audiophile by some listeners.",1
"Christmas and love ballads beautifully done. I played my way through 2 LPs of this concert and loved every minute of it. When the technology became available, I transferred one of the LPs to a CD. Since this set never came out in any other format, I strongly urge lovers of French-Canadian ballads and of chorale music to purchase a vinyl disc and do the transferring themselves.

One side is devoted to Christmas music, the other to love ballads. If the Chorale Bach de Montreal is perhaps a bit starchy for a few of these selections, this does not detract from the beauty of the overall product. Tres bien all the way.",1
"This lp  from ca. 1960 was cd'd by Haydn House . The CD sound is good, an improvement over the lp, but not as good as some competitive interpretations (Tate, Klemperer, Davis,Jochum). Virtues are characteristic of Leitner: good tempi and orchestral balance, forward winds,, good brass and tympani. #102/4 is played with elan. The military music in 100/2
is moderate where excess sometimes works.  Leitner's more recent Haydn was more successful (#6-8, 5,54, 92,98). But so too were his priceless Mozart performances
with the Bavarian RS0: the Posthorn Serenade and the Linz and Paris Symphonies. I find this coupling worthwhile but not imperative. Leitner remains undervalued by many critics.  He was anything but a Kapellmeister.

Peers: Tate, Klemperer, Jochum, Davis  in both; Sawallisch/VSO in 100",1

"Fantastic music, but the MP3 version stinks I love the music on this album (especially the first and last tracks), and the playing of Goldberg, Coryell and Subramaniam is fantastic throughout. However, the reason for my low rating has to do with the audio quality of the MP3 version. It's basically ripped from a scratchy vinyl version! Seriously, if they really needed to make an MP3 version from a vinyl copy, they couldn't find one to use that was in better condition?? The vinyl copy I have sounds superior.
If you are a fan of these musicians and have a turntable, try to get a vinyl copy instead. Otherwise, the MP3 version is better than nothing, but definitely not as good.",0

I thought maybe I should just listen and see if it got better.

It did not. It was horrible. If you are used to the more soothing type binaural beats or subliminal audios, skip this one. It did not make me more positive....it made me annoyed.",0
"Has narrator reading a disclosure at the beginning AND the end While the sounds are amazing, I have one REALLY big gripe that should be a huge deal breaker for most people.

HERE'S MY DEAL BREAKER:
About five seconds in, a narrator comes on to read a disclosure.  It goes like this: ""Warning, this session includes audible hypnotic suggestions, subliminal messages and binaural beats.  It should not be used in a moving vehicle or any other time when you need to be fully awake and alert.""  Then about one minute before it ends you hear yet another disclosure:  ""Warning, this session is about to end.  Please give yourself a few minutes to become completely alert before resuming normal activity.""  And god forbid if you have these on repeat.

I use these for sleep, naps, while at work, and when studying.  Essentially, it's ambient sounds to drown out any other, distracting, sounds.  Extremely annoying and very distracting.  Imagine being completely relaxed, you're feeling good; daydreaming even.  Then, you're immediately jerked back to reality with this disclosure.

There are many, many other titles that DO NOT contain these annoying messages.",0
"IRRITATING I have listened to many brain wave CDs and like a lot of them.  But this one sounds very electronic and cold.  Good for the Borg, maybe, but not me.",0
"like fingers on a chalkboard I added this into an 8 hour playlist for my sleep.  The sounds of the crackling and popping of the fire woke me up.  I suppose some people find those sounds soothing, but I find them disturbing and frightening in the middle of the night, especially when they are right in my ear.  I have a fear of fire, especially of the house burning down in the middle of the night and this disturbed me so much I couldn't go back to sleep.

I tried to listen to it during the daylight, but I just cannot find anything relaxing about it.  I certainly don't know how anyone can feel positive after listening to it.  It only makes me anxious and fearful.

"Background music Because I have moderate tinnitus, I play music in the background when I read. I prefer music that doesnt change much in volume, doesnt demand my attention, but is still worth listening to when I take a break from reading. For background music, I recommend Kamal El Manars Blessing the Calm and Complete Relaxation. I do not recommend ""Innocence""; I found it to be almost strident in the playing, and the composition.",0

"Very Repetitive When I first played this album, I got a lot of distortion from the low end rythm.  This ocurred both in my car and on my computer.  I thought it was the music.  I later discovered that another set of speakers and a boom box I own could play it without distortion.

The music itself is very repetitive.  Pretty much the same thing over and over for an hour.

And how does Amazon manage to download music to my computer so it doesn't save?  I had to repurchase to get it on my computer.",0
"Not Worth It Terrible piece of music.  I felt like I wasted my time listening to it.  At least it only cost 99 cents.  Going forward, I'll be sure to steer clear of any Brainwaves Lab mp3's.  I did not like any of 3 I purchased.",0

"Best Compilation in the Entire World I hyperventilated when Amazon emailed me about this CD. It was fortuitous. I had this CD, a gift my freshman year in college, that I kept on rotation so much that I wore it out. I have been searching for a new copy to call my own for about 7 years, looking everywhere. Not even Metropolis Records, the label, could help me. (Curious.) Of course I bought it about 45 seconds after I read my email. It arrived in a timely fashion and I have felt complete ever since. The only problem is that, for whatever reason. when I get to Track 3 (Project Pitchfork) the CD catches about halfway through the song (a real travesty) and I am unable to listen to the rest of it. It is strange because #1 the CD was still in the plastic when it arrived, #2 I have a boss CD player in my car, and #3 it is only at that certain part on this one CD. I have no problems with anything else I own. So, hmmm. Not enough to ruin my enjoyment. Overall I would absolutely buy this again. And again. And again, and you should too. Best compilation CD in the history of compilation CDs.",1
"The antithesis of relaxing! I actually deleted this album from my I-pod after trying to listen to it several times. The theme sound that runs through it is that of wind in the branches of trees (not ocean waves as the cover suggests). Somehow it just evoked a cold, blustery day and since I've never enjoyed cold, blustery days, I found it nerve-wracking, not nerve soothing.  All I could think about was how this was what the sound track from 'Into the Wild' sounded like when they found the kid dead from exposure in Alaska. Gross!",0
"Very Useful Song! Having a party going a little too wild? Need everyone to get out? Never Fear! Just put this little gem on and people will start trampling over each other to get out. Want to break up with someone and don't know how? Just play this song in the car and Warning Signs will be blaring in your significant ex's head. Need to torture those pesky Taliban's for information? Just put this song on repeat and come back after a few hours and they'll tell you what kind of underwear their mother's wear!

Special thanks to Angela Pivarnick's parents for raising a spoiled delusional bitch, because only someone like that is capable of pinching out a song that can only be described as the Zen of s***.",0

Different than the H&H Society recording of the 70s Due to microphone placement this recording brings out different orchestral voices that you usually do not hear. Makes listening (particularly with an orchestral score continually interesting. Varried tempi with wonderful soloists.

This cd is usually my goto at work. I never get tired of it.",1
One of THE best!!! I love Mega Man and seeing as this is by far one of the best game soundtracks (to me anyhow) thats why I rated it a five. Brings back my fond memories and just a fun theme to listen to.,1

And the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  And since a new Dr. Dre-brand-album always precipitates a lot of other great talent (and usually some well-prepared responses from the competition) it should be a fun year in the clubs. Maybe Detox really will be the SACD 5.1-mastered Double Concept Rap Opera Album it deserves to be.  Perfectly mixed and deeply complex, Dr. Dre tracks are the hip hop gold standard.",1

"Swing On! Almost since the first performance of the bad created by Scotty Morris in 1989, Big Bad Voodo Daddy has been wooing aficionados of almost every music genre to modern day swing.  I would challenge almost anyone who has even the slightest appreciation of music to listen to this [what I consider their best recorded work] collection by BBVD and not become almost instantly transfixed by the tight l performances of the group; within seconds of starting any selection on this album [there isn't a 'clunker' in the bunch] you will find yourself moving to the addictive rhythms and beats delivered with a powerful professionalism not captured or repeated to such perfection since the original era of swing in the 1940's.  If you are tired of trying to find something 'new' to refresh your appreciation of today's music scene, do yourself a favor...get this album!  Load it up, turn it up and Swing On!

"instantly compels the listener to thrust the volume knob to maximum intensity to enjoy its full effect BOSTON set a new standard in the Rock & Roll industry but this song, Higher Power, was a total surprise in my expectation of the bands unique Gibson guitar sound and vocals. This song, with its stepped up rhythm and bass, instantly compels the listener to thrust the volume knob to maximum intensity to enjoy its full effect. Sensualistic beauty combined with thunderous cascading bass, vocals, guitar solos,harmonicas, (YES! a harmonica in a Boston song? and it captivates!) keeps you always at the edge of expectation which this song DEFINEATELY delivers ! Like a well tuned sports car, the exhaust note wants to make you accelerate past all limits with the comfort of knowing the ride is better and better the faster you go. Sophisticated enhancements with RAW wild power... ""Higher Power""  DELIVERS! The small sound/ vocal sample provided here is NOTHING compared to the songs complete ability to please its listener. Quite simply, ""Higher Power"" has become one of my most favorite ""go-to"" songs in my vast music library.

"Poor Quality Recording DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 !!!

Although I like the song, the quality of the recording is terrible (in spots).  Portions sound like it was recorded off on old LP that had skips and jumps.  I know there is a ""good version"" of the song out there somewhere because I've heard it on the radio several times.

Whoever Amazon bought this MP3 from either did not listen to the song after it was created in the MP3 format or they did listen and just didn't care that it was defective.

Amazon states in their MP3 Music Downloads Terms of Use that music downloads are not returnable once they have been purchased.  Well, here are my terms - I have an expectation that the quality of the downloaded music will be good according to most people's standard of digital music.  This song did not meet those standards.

"deceiving people for charity...thats messed up People ought to contribute to charity albums and buy charity albums because they care about a cause or want that rare track from an artist who is donating their time/song to someone else.

To say ""Joey Curatolo of Rain: A Tribute To the Beatles on Broadway"" who cares if you play in a snazzy Beatles tribute band?

After making myself sit through the original Bieber music video, I have to respect the quality of the parody, as the Baneling artists (HuskyStarcraft and KurtHugoSchneider) do a great job of mirroring the original, and Husky has more musical talent than I would have expected. Though I don't know that I could recommend it to a non-gamer, this is a great buy for Starcraft fans who can appreciate the lyrics as well as the musical parody.",1

"Thank you Danielle Dove... Just a little bit about me, so that you can fully understand why I gave the review of this wonderful ""Meditating With Angels"" CD by Danielle Dove 5 stars.

I am very connected to Nature, and Believe that nature holds the power to heal us if we can connect with it's healing energies. I am also very connected to Angels, and I believe that through meditation, visualization, listening, praying and envoking the Archangels and Guardian Angels, that they can be with us at all times, under all circumstances, and helping us with every aspect of our lives. I believe we can heal Physically and Emotionally by communicating with our angels on a daily basis from a place of love and gratitude.

I Do a lot of Angel Work, Crystal Therapy, Color Therapy, Chakra Clearing and Centering,, meditation, Visualization, Guided Imagery, Yoga etc..and they are all connected. I also spend as much time in Nature as possible, spending time in nature with the living breathing spirit of Mother Earth and her wisdom, with trees, fresh air, flowers, water, sunshine, moon, grass, rock formation etc.. is just another way to reinforce the healing energies that are available to us if we can just tap into them.

I have a lot of Audio CD's of guided meditations, imagery and visualizations that I adore that mostly encorporate Angels and/or nature into them since that is what resonates with me personally.

The reason I am so impressed with Danielle Dove's ""Meditating with Angels"" and gave it 5 stars, is because she encorporated  the aspects of healing with BOTH Angels AND Nature. She manages to sooth and relax you with her beautiful Angelic calming voice, while explaining why nature and Angels are so important to our health and well being, and how they can heal us.  Danielle leads you through beautiful, peaceful meditations focusing on each Chakra,one at a time, to help you Clear and open your Chakras energies for more love, light and healing.

Another thing that I really liked about Danielle's Chakra meditations, is that she does focus on each one seperately for a nice amount of time, yet, they all seamlessly transition into one another. Danielle starts with the Root Chakra, and then as she progresses upward to each additional Chakra, incorporates the new clearing and openess from the previous one you just worked on, into the next one, then those two into the next one, and so forth, so you can really feel how they are not just all seperate energy centers within us, but are in fact all connected on a very fundamental level.

I have heard some CD's where you feel almost 'rushed' to move from one thought to another, or one feeling to another, having to transition and visualize quickly in order to keep up with the speaker... which in my opinion, no matter how good the content is, is not relaxing or effective, because without being able to fully relax and open, you cannot get to the place of inner work you need to get to. I have several CD's that I love the content of, but listen to during the day while working or so forth instead, because they cannot relax me for a meditation sessiion do to the fast pace of the content.
Danielle does a wonderful job of not talking, or 'moving' through her explanations or guided meditations too quickly, thus allowing you time to fully relax, ""sink"" into the comfort of her voice. and become still in mind and body, to be able to focus completely on what she is saying, and visualize it, and literally feel it.

Danielle's CD ""Meditating with Angel's"" also has the most glorious backround water sounds that plays at just the right volume. It doesn't overpower her voice, or distract you from the meditations, however, you can hear it softly in the backround which is just perfect, and adds the extra element of relaxation and connection with nature.

I highly recommend this CD! Thank you Danielle, for a wonderfully enlightening CD that I will treasure as one of the very best in my entire collectiion. I hope to see much more related content from you in the months and years to come!

Angel Blessings!",1
"Quality find Imrat Khansab does a great rendition of Yaman on this album. Not as lyrical as Ustadji (Vilayat Kahn, his brother) but the surbahar gives the performance real depth because of the lower tone qualities. Beautiful, and highly recommended for people interested in exploring Indian classical music.",1
Five Stars Good song,1
"A Cholic Mass and Not Much More The album opens with church bells.  Unlike Russian Orthodox church bells there is not much inspiration here.  The mass is just that, Latin chants for the components of the mass.  This music will appeal to those who are interested in Catholic church music.  This is music meant for the church and will not inspire most people looking for a concert experience.  This isn't the requiem masterpiece that Durufle wrote.  Stephen Tharp's improvisations add some spice to otherwise uninteresting organ music that accompanies the choir.",0

Five Stars Wonderful ep.  U2 rules.,1
"A bit of 411 regarding Wide awake in Europe Release! Way back in 1986,  U2 released an album (CD) called; ""Wide Awake in America"". This album arrived in between their two monster releases, ""The Unforgettable Fire"" (1985) & ""The Joshua Tree"" (1987).  Their intent was to give the small independent record shop owners in the USA something unique and limited with which to sell. The record contained 4 songs in all, 2 live and 2 unreleased studio recordings. While interesting, it wasn't anything to write home about. Eventually over time this album (CD) became available everywhere.
I mention this bit of vinyl history because that Irish band that everyone knows and loves is at it again with the latest release, Wide Awake in Europe. This time around U2 is only selling this EP (its not a full album by any stretch of the imagination) to the independent music stores of greater Europe. What is curious with this release is that U2 chose to release it only in vinyl. Seeings how the Compact Disc has been the music media of choice for the past 30 years, I find the band's choice of medium perplexing at best. All songs on the release are ""live"" recordings. Only the first song ""Misery"" is generating much fanfare as U2 has been playing in in concert on the current European leg of their tour. The 3 other songs are of unknown quality in terms of popularity. I say this because with these other unknown songs its pot luck at best, meaning they may be great or far from it. Only you will be able to decide which after listening to them.
In conclusion, unless you count yourself as a U2 ""completeist"", then you might want to skip this album at least for the time being. One song does not a record purchase make. So unless you're able to pick this up at or near the original asking price, I'd pass on this. This is the reason behind the rather high priced gouging  your experiencing here on Amazon & elsewhere on the web. This album is ONLY being sold in Europe and ONLY to independent record sellers that sell records, no ""big box stores"".  If history serves as any indicator, within the next several years or so U2's ""Wide Awake in Europe"" will eventually and quietly find its way on to CD at a more reasonable price to boot. Patience is its own reward!",0
Five Stars Love it! Love it! Love it!,1
"Timeless music Ordered this record based on a recommendation from a friend who stated that Valens was the greatest artist that never was. After listening to this, it's hard to disagree. There was so much potential in the 17 year old that we never got to see realized, but what he left behind is a very small catalogue of well crafted songs.",1

"A Charlie Hunter album for the guitar geeks OK, everybody knows the deal with Charlie Hunter.  He plays either a 7 or 8 string custom guitar (mostly 7 these days) with some bass strings and some regular guitar strings, and fanned frets.  The set-up allows him to play the bass line and the guitar line simultaneously like some freak of nature.  Usually, though, he plays with a band and if you didn't know what was going on, you wouldn't realize that the guitarist and the bassist are the same guy, playing without overdubs.  On Public Domain, he plays unaccompanied, so there is nobody else to distract from the shear genius of his instrumental work.  The title of the album refers to the contents-- all of the tracks are old pieces that exist in the ""public domain,"" meaning that nobody holds the copyrights, so anyone can record them.  If you are a fan of traditional blues, jazz and folk, you will know most of the songs.  The cool thing is, though, that if you don't look at the track list, you will still have to think hard about what some of the songs are while listening to them because Hunter updates and personalizes the pieces so well.  The mood is fun, and the guitar work is as good as anything Hunter has ever recorded.  If you are looking for the more funk-influenced stuff he has done lately on albums like Mistico and Copperopolis, you won't find as much of that here.  This is more like his Duo album with Leon Parker, both in the stripped-down nature and the more straight jazz aesthetic.  Hunter is channeling his Joe Pass/Lenny Breau influences more than his John Scofield influences.  I wish Hunter would record more like this.  His only other unaccompanied album (Solo Eight-String Guitar) isn't exactly a widely available cd.  That puts Public Domain up there with the Leon Parker Duo album as one of my favorite Hunter recordings.

Further listening: Phil DeGruy.  DeGruy plays a 17-string guitar.  No, that's not a typo.  He plays unaccompanied, and frequently records wildly re-imagined old gems, kind of like Hunter does on this album.",1

"Beware: duplicate content with that of another disk Five stars for recording quality. Four stars for Maria Da F, although it's probably not fair to knock off a star because she's not Amlia. But so far in my investigations of female fadistas, I like her second best. Which is saying a lot, because I've tried a generous hunk of them. (I'm not a fan of Mariza, but that's another story entirely.)

However--two stars off because every one of these tracks is present on the 2014 release, ""Fado Essencial,"" and ""Essencial"" has four more tracks. I can't swear that the versions are the same and don't have time right now to check fado by fado, but I've listened to the one track that's titled somewhat differently, and it seems to be identical with the one on ""Essencial.""

So sorry not to be able to give a more detailed review of voice and fados, but I haven't time right now and thought I'd get this up quickly in case it would save someone else $10 or so.",0

Unbalanced, underproduced, sounding like some Bobbie snuck a recording using a mini cassette recorder before closing down the performance due to neighbors complaining. Maybe someday I hope Apple will produce a clean remastered balanced version of what could be a great swan song concert and not the junk this disc offers! I gave one stat for the only highlight of this cd which is the closing number. Pauls Long and Winding Road which almost sound decent and has some nice Harrison guitar stripped down along McCartneys piano! Stay away till Apple does this right! Peace",0

"A great rendition of a classic I was a bit skeptical when I saw the mix of artists on this track - I didn't think the four vocalists would gel at all. I could not have been more wrong. The song starts with the typical Jagger swagger before trading off lead vocals with Bono. What shocked me however was how Fergie absolutely slayed the ""Rape, Murder"" interlude while putting her own spin on it.

Honestly, I think this is one of the best tracks to come out of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame collaborations ever. Definitely worth the purchase.",1

"Id never heard more beautiful lyre music in ancient Greek modes I am a graduate student in Classical Studies, and my research assistant work involves making educational videos on ancient topics for our department.

I first encountered Mr. Levys music on Youtube while looking for a suitable backing track, and I was blown away by how haunting and lovely his compositions are. Despite being in the field, Id never heard more beautiful lyre music in ancient Greek modes. I not only used a medley of Mr. Levy's music for our departments video, but now listen to his albums while Im studying for exams or relaxing.

The First Delphic Hymn To Apollo in particular lent a wonderful tone to our video. Ill personally always associate it with my bus rides to school, doing Greek flashcards and studying through the summer. Mr. Levys music is a wonderful resource for specialists and fans of the ancient world alike.",1
"Amazing! I don't recall  how I discovered Michael Levy's work.

"Must Have for Rooster Teeth Fans This album is an incredible buy, having most of the music Rooster Teeth had created for their 8th season of Red vs. Blue. It's also got a few extra tracks that are sure to please any fan of the series. Who can't love Sarge and Caboose singing in character? Just a word of warning to something I encountered: this soundtrack does not include a clean version of the music played during the final fights in the show. Two versions are included under the title of ""Red vs. Blue"", but they have vocals attached. Not that I entirely mind, but if you're trying to find that particular track in a clean form, it won't be here.

Regardless, this is an incredible soundtrack, and well worth the money.",1

"Beautiful CD Stepfanie Kramer is a classically trained mezzo soprano.  She puts her heart and soul into these songs and this was recorded live without computers to autotune, etc. like a lot of artists use today.  This is straight up unadulterated talent.  The beauty of these songs and her voice go together wonderfully.  If you are a fan of standards, you must take a listen to this one.  Track #9 ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  You have the voice of an angel, Stepfanie.  I look forward to hearing more from you in the future.",1

"Whut Happened Redman has been my favorite rapper since he guest featured on EPMD's ""Hardcore"" on their sophomore album ""Business As Usual"". ""Muddy Waters"" is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I'm extremely disappointed with ""Reggie"". If Red was trying to figure out a way to alienate his loyal target audience he accomplished it with this album. Lyrically he is still ""Red"" but those tracks are straight garbage. I would expect one of these new ""Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"" artists (and there are many)to use tracks like this not a Hip Hop legend. The one thing I've always loved about Redman(his loyal followers would probably agree with me on this) is that he was always in his own lane-a lane he created. His sound was unique to him and there was no one else like him. He has gotten away from the sound and style that made him Redman. He is still one of my favorite rappers I just hope he comes correct on his next project.",0
"Redman Leaves Def Jam With a Dud It is obvious that Def Jam did not put much effort into producing or marketing this album.  It is clear that this album was the last of the contract and they're fine with putting out a poor product. If you're hoping for another classic like Whut? Thee Album, this is more like What Iz This Ablum? Redman has sub par lyrics that are rarely clever or thought provoking, and the disc is completely devoid of any fun even with Method Man's appearance where the two just do a verse instead of riffing off each other with their witty repartee? This should have been halted in production? Redman wasn't into it and it's a sad finale for a Def Jam great.  True fans will listen and enjoy little sparks of the old Red, but Doc is so much more than this.  However, The one thing I can say is that he at least tried to stick to his roots.  At least it's not rediculous autotuned metaphors worthy of a 12 year old which is what has become of the sad state of mainstream rap music today, referring to it as Hip Hop would be just too kind.",0
Disappointed I was expecting the original version. It's not the original version and the remake sounds weird.,0

"Punk band that cant seem to find their sound. I have Fenix Tx first cd and I would rate it 3 stars. Lechuza just sounds odd. Fenix Tx tried to go somewhat hardcore on Lechuza and they failed. The vocals are pitchy and the  songs are just bland. Nothing to offer for punk rockers like me. Fenix Tx just isn't unique. They are average pop punk rock and they really aren't that good. I did somewhat like their debut album,but it wasn't anything special. The lead singer is just average. You can hear pitchiness in his voice when he sings. The instruments are very standard for a pop punk band also. The concept for Lechuza is very odd and it feels like Fenix Tx just threw some unreleased demos onto an album. So,you really shouldn't waste your money on them. I would even give you my copy of their debut album if I could! Also,they sound very similar to New Found Glory!",0

The band had a blast with the ""angelic"" backing vocals.  And of course we're fans of anything that combines Elvis, Jim Beam and Fred Flintstone.  IT's like something out of a Mojo Nixon record.

"Sounds of Success number 3 ""Take Your Time (Do It Right)"" became SOS Band's biggest hit prior to this album and they wouldn't score another big hit single until 1983, which means that R&B fans have overlooked the marvelous work that was done on the band's 1982 release. This album was not Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' first produced work (Klymaxx's Girls Will Be Girls album came out several months earlier was their first) because they didn't have a hand in producing any tracks on III, however they did write ""High Hopes"" for the band of which is the duo's first song under their name that was a hit single (#25 R&B hit in early 1983). That song solidified them as cutting their teeth with producing for the band as them being the most in demand producers in the music business within the next 3 decades to come.  All the songs was produced by Sylvers' member, Ricky Sylvers (Leon Sylvers' younger brother) and veteran songwriter, Gene Dozier, explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album, but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made (in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself). ""High Hopes,"" ""Good & Plenty,"" ""You Shake Me Up,"" and ""Have It Your Way"" were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of. ""Looking For You"" was a bouncy track yet funkier version of ""Take Your Time."" Although this wasn't the best SOS Band album (in my opinion); it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would be the near exclusive producers for SOS Band by the next album, thus changing the sound and standards of black music with the heavy use of the 808 drum machines and synthesizers of which would also make them stars overseas as well. That is why I call this album the best before their best.",1

"Great music, but get the CD, not the MP3 This is not a critique of the music, but of the distribution. The music is recorded as one long continuous stream of music, indexed into 8 pieces. Amazon simply rips the disc and saves them as eight individual songs. Thus, playing the album back as eight MP3's results in half-second pauses that at some points is quite jarring. Since the MP3 standard requires a (very brief) moment of silence at the beginning and end of every song, joining the eight songs requires a lot of manual work.

Skip this trouble and buy the CD. Then use the ""rip as single track"" option on any number of available programs.",0
"Music you definitely want to check out! If you are looking for some new and interesting sounds to experience, then DO check out Black Holes and Butterflies. Great lead vocals.",1
"Pick and choose only certain tracks. I have to agree with hyperbolium, there are some originals, but a lot of remakes.  ""Rhythm of the Rain"" is one of those remakes.  It lacks the energy and little touches that made the original popular in the first place.  Your best bet is to carefully listen to the tracks, and buy only the originals.  Sadly, you do not get as many tracks for your money that way, but quality is something the record labels could care less about these days. It has become typical for compilations like this to throw in a few gems, hoping you won't take the time to notice all the ""filler"" tracks they put on the album to make a quick buck.",0
"Not the Originals These songs sound terrible, definately not the originals.  Sound like bad cover versions.  Please avoid these 'One Hit Wonder' albums if you like the original songs.",0
"A couple of originals and many remakes Like so many other MP3 collections recently issued by K-Tel, this one is populated almost entirely by remakes. This is particularly egregious in the case of ""one hit wonders,"" as the artist's one brief moment of fame is hidden from unsuspecting listeners by these soundalikes. In a few cases, such as the Spiral Starecase's ""More Today Than Yesterday,"" truth in advertising wins out by relabeling the artist ""Pat Upton Formerly of Spiral Starecase,"" but for most of the cuts the artist is listed by their original name, and no notation is made that these are modern re-recordings. As with all such compilations, some of the new versions are truer to the originals than others; a few may even be the originals, but without clearer documentation, it's hard to know what's what.

The version of ""Liar, Liar"" that opens the set sounds like the original, in wide stereo, and Ian Whitcomb's ""You Turn Me On"" also sounds like the real deal. But it's quickly downhill from there. ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"" doesn't approach the grandiosity of the Phil Spector-produced Wall of Sound, and ""Incense and Peppermints"" sounds more like a MIDI-arrangement with worn vocals than a psych-pop masterpiece. ""Rhythm of the Rain"" is sung as a folk song rather than latter-day doo-wop, and it's missing the signature celeste; several other tracks, despite good performances and solid vocals, shade the tempos a hair fast or slow, and have modern production that's too clean to reproduce the feel of the hit singles.

No doubt many of these recreations offer artists a chance to reconnect with royalties signed away in a flush of youthful innocence; they also offer die-hard fans an opportunity to hear an alternate to the well-known hits. But those seeking real AM radio thrills should look for a collection of original recordings such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barry-Williams-Presents-One-Hit-Wonders-of-the-70s/dp/B000F3AJXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barry Williams Presents: One-Hit Wonders of the 70s</a>, Dick Bartley's One Hit Wonders of the `60s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1/dp/B0000032TV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2/dp/B0000032TX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2</a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eric-Records-Hard-to-Find-45s-on-CD/dp/B00005Q6Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eric Records' Hard to Find 45s on CD</a>, Rhino's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Hits-of-the-70s-Have-a-Nice-Day/dp/B0000032R5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Hits of the `70s: Have a Nice Day</a>&nbsp;series, or the treasure-chest box-set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Have-a-Nice-Decade/dp/B000006OIT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Have a Nice Decade</a>.

"Raw and honest, brilliant storytelling for the reader and non-reader alike After finishing Daveland, I do see why the memoir works so well. It really is a very engaging story and I personally identified with Marty's character as I had some struggles as a child with mild dyslexia and epilepsy myself. I can identify with knowing what it's like to be labeled as ""unique"" growing up... I think the most brilliant thing about this audio book is the vehicle itself - that Marty Castleberg is telling his story so that others that share his struggle might be able to HEAR it and relate or be inspired by it. With Daveland as an audiobook, anyone can ""read"" this story and enjoy the journey, both dramatic and humorous, and most of all told from the heart. I enjoyed every minute.",1

"Great content but reader a little monotonous I am a student of Napoleon Hill and have most of his works in print.  I love audio books since I can listen while driving, working out, or right before bed with I-Pod.  This complete work is the unabridged (24 cds!) of his Law of Success volume.  The content is excellent and more thorough than ""Think and Grow Rich"" so allows for deeper understanding and application.

The length of volume and readers limited inflections (I assume he is not trying to color content) makes this monotonous for listening in long stretches.  That said, for 8.99 this is a truly great value and I would highly reccommend!

I would also reccomend Napleon Hill -""In His Own Word"" which is the author in is ""own voice""!",1

"A GREAT HISTORIC RING IN A NEW SPECTACULAR REMASTERING-A MUST FOR EVERY WAGNERIAN!!! This is the 1950 Furtwangler/La Scala RING with Flagstad in a new remastering.  The sound is spectacular and we now have a new remastering that truly reveals the genius of Furtwangler in all its myriad orchestral colors.  The sound stage for both singers and orchestra is unprecedented for this 1950 Historic RING.  Never before have we heard such clear orchestra detail in such well balanced clean sound between the singers and pit.  Any other mastering of this RING, including Gebhardt, is left in the so called ""starting gate"" to use a horse race term.  It is truly SPECTACULAR!  It's as if, like AUDITE with their RIAS new radio master tapes of both Furtwangler and now Knappertsbusch live concerts of the 50's ARCHIPEL has been given new first generation excellent radio broadcast tapes; and with many of these broadcasts now being legal to distribute (public domain), that could be the case.  Whatever the case, this new transfer or remastering is a huge audio advance.  I don't need to repeat all the raves about this historic performance; except to say, NOW IT SONICALLY LIVES UP TO ITS REPUTATION.  The sound is now almost like excellent studio MONO of the first tier.  Furtwangler is the true star of this RING. You hear things in the orchestra that no other conductor finds; yet, everything seems so natural and just right.  All the motives are so clear and all the climaxes just overwhelming.  Flagstad is magnificent.  Lorenz is great just at the end of a great career.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1

That album had a different arrangement of some of the tracks listed on this album and some of the tracks here are not on that album and yet it still had a very nice flow and sounded a much more cohesive and hence much more enjoyable to listen to album.  Until we get a similar release of that album then ""Danger"" will hold the mantle as The Great Voice's best album.

My introduction to The Great Voice was years ago as a child watching a program on tv called ""Solid Gold"" which was a big hit at the time. I was blown away when this unassuming chap came on and belted out in an unbelievable display of vocal range, tone and powerful delivery an extremely well written song called ""Love You Like I Never Loved Before."" I just loved the way the song combined powerful rock power chords with tender balladic lyrics which wasn't very common at the time but which was quickly imitated ever since. I remember ever since that night I spent many days trying to find that track somewhere on cassette but with no success. I finally found it on a bootleg copy of a various hits compilation (there were many of these in those days).  What my brother managed to find in the meantime though was an original, legal version of ""Close-Up"" or the Japanese version of ""Danger"" on cassette which between ourselves we listened to until all the oxide fell off the tape.  It was just that enjoyable an album and although ""Danger"" is no ""Close-Up"" I guess it'll have to do until we also get a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of ""Close-Up"" too.

Pleasant results usually follow the collaboration of great songwriters and great singers and we get no exception here. The Joey Carbone/Richie Zito/Kathi Pinto partnership on one side and The Great Voice on the other has resulted in a very strong release of love song crooning in one of its better incarnations.  Unlike the debut album which had one cover all the tracks here are originals.  There are many standout tracks here that show a vast improvement over the debut album release.  Tracks like my favourite ""Our Love"", ""I'm The One"", ""Deep In the Night"", ""I Don't Want To Love Your Love"", ""Through the Eyes of Love"", ""Take Me Back"" and the bonus track ""Inside This Heart of Mine"" are just very well written songs and the other 3 bonus tracks of live material add to the overall enjoyment of the main course.

The mlps release itself is not much to shout about not being one of the better designs and assembly that I have ever seen but the sound quality is very good. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in English.

For fans of the early 80s romantic ballad genre ala Jim Photoglo, Paul Davis, Dan Fogelberg etc this release comes highly recommended!",1
"No go! Between the synthed sound track and the morphed voicebox, this song has become over-processed to the point that it's soul has been removed.",0
"Absolutely worthless If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would. If you are a curious REM fan, don't waste your time, even for free. If you're a fan of current styles of music, surely there must be something more interesting out there for you than a watered-down classic rock song with all the life choked out of it. It's mainly just the lyrics done to a monotonous beat with none of the build or drama of the original, and also not much of a groove, just monotony.",0
"Lost its religion What made REM's version immortal was Stipe's passionate ownership of the lyrics.  In a blend of REM melody and vocal angst, there is a beauty and emotion that grips the listener to feel the song.

Colton Ford's version strips away the lush melody, and synths over whatever emotion might have been in the vocals.  The result is a dead-pan cover with all of the lyrics and none of the soul from the original, which makes me wonder if he ever understood the song in the first place.",0
"Not for R.E.M. fans The vocal has no artistry.  If you think any song will be better over wrought with synth, then you will like this.  I like covers, when there's an original spin, but the spin here is to make it sound like a million other pop songs.",0
"S.O.S Band - - The Finest! Wow, does this song take you back or what.  This was the hit back in the day - - the drum and percussion in the back and
the fine vocals.  I can just see everybody at the party swaying their heads and shoulders from side to side - - yeah.
""Oh baby, you're the finest . . . .""  So glad, I found this song! (LoL.)",1

"Beautiful Christmas Album! Joe Bongiorno's ""A Candlelight Christmas"" is quite simply a beautiful solo piano Christmas Album. Winner of the 2010 SoloPiano.com Christmas Album of the Year, this album is one you will want to be sure and add to your Christmas Collection. Great job, Joe!",1
"A great sampling of their older work, stripped down I learned of these guys from friends who saw the famous Letterman performance, and after wearing out their latest album ""Singles"", I decided to look back through their catalog.  They have some really great stuff, though no one album as wholly good as Singles.  But they really hit some high notes, and this is a pretty awesome stripped down (thus ""Undressed"") collection of four of their older highlights.  Highly recommended if you've heard anything from them and it catches you like it caught me.",1
"rerecorded I'm getting pretty tired of re-recorded work being passed off as the original recording. This stuff shouldn't even exist, but if it's the only recording available, it should at least be labeled.",0

"Absolutely Amazing This cover not only sounds like the original, but it is truly a great lyrical song. I really enjoy what you've done here. One of my favorites!",1
Chris Cain is still strong I was suprised when I was browsing the new releases and found a new Chris Cain CD. I own all of Chris's work on Cd including the impossible to locate Christmas CD. I read one of the not so stellar reviews of the Cd and decided to judge myself. Chris's voice and guitar work are always a treat. Some of the material doesn't beg to played over and over again such as unscheduled flight or Chris's early works. Still a must for Chris's fans. Chris is a blues giant and a true gentleman.,1
"waste of time I have been a big fan of Chris Cain for 20 years, buying anything of his I could find. When I saw his new cd ""So Many Miles"" on presale on amazon, I ordered it right-a-way.  When I first listened to the cd, I thought it can't really be this bad, so I listened to it three straight times on a trip to Kansas City.  It really is this bad.  Chris still has a strong voice and his playing, as always, is great.  It's just that his vocals and guitar are stuck in some of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The lyrics will make your cringe, and the horn tracks sound like a junior high band concert.  I'll never listen to this cd again, and I hope I can get $2 at the used cd store.",0
"This Was Not a Good Download I listened to this song about three times trying to figure out why it didn't sound right. It is just a bad recording and part of the background music is missing. It's kind of like listening to stereo with only one speaker. That is the best way I can describe it. Anyway, I deleted it from my MP3 player which was sad because I love that song.",0

"AMAZING! Ministry of Magic is my favorite wizard rock band. I would have to say this is their best album yet, which is saying a lot because the other ones are great. Ministry of Magic is so good at creating songs with great emotional depth alongside others that are super fun that you can't help but dance to. If you like Harry Potter, you should get this, even if you don't listen to wizard rock. Jason Munday has one of the most amazing voices ever.",1
"Cooking & Country I heard this song while watching ""The Pioneer Woman""; it's a happy sounding song.",1
"good and bad.. I don't like downloads, why no cd available of this vol 2 of 70's it looks really good? I like their other cds, such great idea for Christian music",0
Five Stars Love'd it,1
be sure this is the version you want.  Not what I was after. Did not care for this.  I thought it was the other version.  Should have listened to a sample before buying it.  Ohg well.  It's just a buck and I can just delete it.,0
"Not the version I thought I was purchasing Was not the radio version I was thinking I purchased. It was Johnny Lee - but it's a very watered down, tinny sounding version of the song. Boo!",0
"Nicki Bluhm and the Gramblers I stumbled onto Nicki and The Gramblers totally by chance. Someone sent me a clip of them singing an old Hall and Oates tune (""I cant go for that"") in their van and I was hooked.

To anyone reading this review, please take moment to check them out. You will not be disappointed...",1
hated it I bought this after seeing the van series on you tube. that was light bright and fun. driftwood was dull leaden and completely boring. I would not recommend this to anyone.,0
"Have loved all of his stories since I was little Have loved all of his stories since I was little. When I found out I could get them individually, I had to have them!!!!",1
Great at first then falls apart!!! P. O.S!! I bought this because of the reviews. Obviously the people who reviewed haven't had it for a year. The hose at the base split open so there was no suction. so like other users I duct taped it! Tacky I know but I didn't want to have to replace the stupid thing if the motor was still working! Then the roller stopped spinning. I called the company and they said they'd replace it but I had to pay to ship it to (probably $40 - $50) and pay to get a new one sent($20). So basically I could pay almost what you'd pay for a new one to get it replaced !!! I am beyond sick of buying a new vacuum every year! Everything is cheap and made for crap!!!! They are made cheaply so you'll have to keep replacing them! Buyer beware!,0
The rhythm does not follow the original words of the ... The rhythm does not follow the original words of the song.  I purchased both the performance track and the accompaniment track.  They don't match.,0
Good As good or better than his dad at least more to my taste or likes really enjoyed the whole album.,1

"Oh no, this is not music It is  two minutes of people talking and a tiny bit of music at the end.  I thought this would be an empowering instrumental song. Not!  It was not worth it.  Only 2 minutes and 40 seconds  long.  not worth it.",0
Five Stars Love this tape,1
Amazon SUCKS! I can't give it ANY stars because Amazon's idiotic download system wouldn't transfer it directly to my Windows Media Player.,0
"Just for Fun Vivacity, warmth and lyricism will take you a long way in Mozart - a long, long way - but not to the end of the line. That's the terminal of artists who contest his kerygma in their marrow.

For all her merits - and dammit, I enjoy this venture - Annerose Schmidtt (ARS) is not in that class. She's too Via Media for her own good. Ornamentation is feeble and contrived. More rubato would go astray - why be so literal and so often at that? Metaphysics is a rarity in this cycle - and ever so worryingly, one could extend this comment to introspection per se. Nevertheless, ARS is so much fun, if you're prepared to accept her limitations (and the not uncommon let's-sight-read-the-score moments from Uncle Kurt Masur on the podium), this survey from the mid-Seventies is compulsive. The full-blooded symphonic contribution of the Dresden Philharmonic is reparatory.

K 175 - The Pocket Rocket derives much of its mojo from timpani. Here it is obscured by the (silky) strings. In summary, this is a thumper in its outer movements whereas the Andante is unimaginative. This is Three Stars at best.

K 238 - This is a well-proportioned reading. Nevertheless, the slow movement is under-characterised - and who would have thought that such a thing was possible? This is a Three Stars job.

K 246 - This is how to play the Ltnow! Indeed, it's the most symphonic version I've ever heard. While the slow movement could be more reflective, it does not detract from the wider affair. This is Five Stars easily. Great stuff!

K 271 - This is the first real test (as some would say). Again, the recording is superb even if the piano prevails over the orchestra. The first movement is vibrancy itself but not much more than that (the same comment is applicable of the finale). While it might appeal to the Taliban, the slow movement is too fast and unreflective for my liking. This is Three Stars where the recording is solid analogue and nothing more.

K 413 - Big bold and brassy - this is a performance of the F major Concerto like none other. It's almost a sinfonia concertante. That being said, the poetic elements are not lost. Five Stars in a canter. Great recording too

K 414 - This masterpiece is played with ardour and delight with a piano-centric recording to match. I cannot fault this. What expectancy is on offer in the slow movement! How the orchestra sings in its prelude! It's enough to melt the sun. This could be the highlight of the set. Five Stars!

K 415 - Oh for a more prominent timpani and brass - but man, everyone is betting the house here so who cares? Five Stars for sure!

K 449 - Here is another massive test. Some - yours truly included - regard it as Mozart's greatest piano concerto. The Dresden Philharmonic offers a symphonic and yet-lithe-on-its-feet contribution. ARS could be more insightful but she's still great fun. This is Four Stars and enjoyable enough.

K 450 - Lively, vivacious and perceptive, what's there not to love? What a graceful opening to the Andante! Again, a virile bass-line underwrites this venture. This is a Five Stars job.

K 451 - Again, timpani could be more prominent. Nevertheless, this unproblematic work is aligned with ARS's skill-set and she does not fail. Five Stars!

K 453 - This is another Olympian test. To a certain extent, the vivacity of the music-making masks the lack of interpretative depth (for instance, the episode-in-the-minor of the Andante is feigned). This is a solid Three Stars job. There are no complaints re the recording.

K 456 - This side of the Pearly Gates, no-one owns this concerto. Anda comes damn close. Again, I cannot fault the outer movements - and I adore the beefy involvement of the Dresden Philharmonic. The slow movement, played literally, is not the last word in tragedy. This is a Three Stars job even if it held my attention. The recording is OK.

K 459 - Again, I love the symphonic opening with strong bass line - and much the same could be said of the finale wherein double basses and cellos bestride like colossi. This arrangement is not to the detriment of woodwind. The opening of the slow movement could be more nuanced (blame Big Kurt as ARS seems to follow his literalism). This is a Four Stars recommendation (just), underwritten by a fine recording.

K 466 - Notwithstanding its musicality, there's no sense of menace here. ARS is far too literal. The Romance is on the fast side. Three Stars and I`m being generous.

K 467 - I can appreciate Mozart as Bruckner - that's what we get in the opening prelude of the first movement from the strings which are vividly recorded - but reportedly there's a timpani and brass in the score and one would like to hear them in this masterpiece.  The slow movement is enjoyable at its breezy pace. This is a solid, musical Three Stars job. Its outer movements in particular held my attention.

K 482 - this performance is Plain Jane on a bad hair-day with zits. Come the big moments, nothing further eventuates - this could have been the genesis of Masur's reputation as a serial-deflator of tyres. The soloist does little to deepen the affair; the Greek Tragedy of the Andante is more like a satyr play. One Star is warranted.

K 488 - the mojo is back in the outer movements which are great fun. Notwithstanding ARS's musicality, the Adagio is devoid of tragedy. This is a Three Star recommendation, underwritten by a fine recording.

K 491 - a great recording and full blooded orchestral response are not going to redeem this semi-tough reckoning with the kerygma of the C Minor Concerto where Uncle Kurt sight-read the score on the day. Being devoid of introspection, this is a Two Stars job.

K 503 - From the perspective of strings and woodwind, this is a great recording even if the poor timpanist down the back gets little airtime. If the symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic was ever going to resonate, it would be in K 503 - and it does so imperiously. ARS is a delight. Five stars all the way.

K 537 - This performance features a great recording - for strings. Calling all timpani and brass - can you please make your way to the microphone! Enjoyable as this is, this performance accepts the Coronation's gallant credentials at face-value and does little with them; experience tells us that there's greater richness to be mined. Three Stars at best!

K 595, as I undertook this survey, I became more and more worried for K 595 as it approached: at their worst, ARS and Big Kurt can be as brainless as headless chickens.  While I love the recording and symphonic response of the Dresden Philharmonic, this K 595 is as elegiac as a McHappy Meal. A solitary star is warranted.

To summarise, this is a middling endeavour. It has a place in the scheme of things. I can understand the viewpoint of the five-star reviewers: one cannot impugn its baseline musicality even if operates in a restricted sphere and its longevity is open to debate. This is damming in its own way, but if you're about to undertake an exacting road-trip, buddy up ARS and Uncle Kurt.

"Jennifer Pumps New Life into the Song As Jennifer blasted it out, it truly is a new dawn and a new light for this song.  Jennifer adds a sass to this song that prior versions do not seem to have.  If you take Michael Bubl's version for instance, it has a great rat pack sort of feel to it.  His voice is all honey but it feels like we have heard it before.  Yet again if we do another comparison with a version like Nina Simone's, her version was sultry and bluesy.  But compared to these great renditions, the song has a whole new set of legs to it thanks to Jennifer.

Within the song whenever Jennifer's voice rises up, she still maintains composure and gives the track a flawless clean feel.  Even the instrumental in the background seems to take this same approach too.  I feel we can say at last that this millennium finally possesses the definitive version of this song.  Its amazing to see the kind of evolution it has gone through, and I can certainly say that Jennifer helped make it possible.  Bravo!",1
"Great voice I've had the pleasure of seeing singer/musician Austin Ellis perform at local venues here in Maryland.  These 5 tracks reflect the same high quality and soulful voice that he has in-person.  Production quality is good, and nothing is lost in comparison from live performance to studio performance.

Two Stars SOUNDS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!,0
"Songwriting at Its Best: Black Crow Blue ""Black Crow Blue,"" the title track from Nathan Bell's most recent album on Stone Barn Records, opens with the question: ""Have you ever seen a sky so wide/That you could fit the whole world inside. I have."" He then inquires, ""Baby, can you see me now?"" Here in this tender ballad, inspired by writer Glen Hirshberg's Book of Bunk, Nathan displays his sensitive and attuned eye for poetic metaphors that are sparse yet accurate descriptors of love, hardship, and what is, at times, the inexplicable journey we're all on in our lives.

He captures what it means to be alone and, particularly, what it means to put love at the forefront of anything else that we think matters.

It is in this, with Nathan's sharp gaze at life, that his songs illuminate how we all are taken in and either worn smooth or left ragged by this journey. Nathan credits much of his inspiration for songs from the works of well-established writers: Hirshberg, Sebastian Matthews, and his father: poet, Marvin Bell, amongst others.
Yet, his songs stand as unique creative works in their own right as well. One doesn't need to know all of the literary references to still get his music.

In ""American Crow,"" Nathan describes his character Crow as a man who never stays put, symbolized by "" . . . tattooed wings beneath [his] skin."" In this opening line, I hear echoes of the ""Crow's"" who have passed through my life. I acknowledge my own impulse to take flight at various junctures. When he sings, ""Black feathers/Hollow bones/Nowhere left/For the light to go/ Sitting on a fence post at the side of the road, American Crow,"" I'm reminded of Paul D in Toni Morrison's Beloved who "" . . . didn't believe he could live with a woman---any woman---for over two out of three months. That was as long as he could abide in one place.""  I suspect that Crow, like Paul D, leaves because it's the only way he feels free, and it's a liberation that dodges heartache.

Nathan's songs lay bare the inclination to wrap ourselves in deceits so that we might avoid facing our own mortality and flaws. In ""Me and Larry,"" Nathan reminisces on his connection with the late-writer, Larry Brown. He sings, ""Somehow always in the end/We become the tales we tell.""  Later, he reflects, ""It was twenty years ago my friend/When I thought that we weren't mortal men.""  He traces the trajectory of believing in time eternal just where it fades as we approach middle age, an age when we begin to experience the loss of others, once young with us.

Black Crow Blue, however, isn't a bleak album.

Yes, Nathan writes about tough times, exploitation, and unfair treatment. But he never neglects the thread of love or shard of hope that holds us together. We hear this in ""A Stone's Throw"" when he sings of a man barely getting by, reeling from a bad economy and poverty. While others want to turn their heads in shame, the singer tells us, ""But I look them in the eyes/Say man, it's me, don't you realize/We're all we've got if we're going to survive."" Ultimately, the song stresses that type of survival: through community, even in the face of unjustness.

(A notable mention here: ""Stone's Throw Away"" was picked up by singer Lizanne Knott for her upcoming 2013 release Standing in the English Rain. She does a kick-ass rendition and arrangement, worthy of checking out.)

On the album's closing track, ""We All Get Gone,"" Nathan digs into a strict blues groove, his wailing harmonica getting as much play time as his vocals.  He moans, "" . . . I'm just traveling/Watch me traveling away/Cause get it right or get wrong, sooner or later/We all get gone."" Despite the resolute attitude of the singer, Nathan conveys a candor that is welcoming and intimate. I'm feeling as though I'm sitting at a coffeehouse table one dusky evening while Nathan strums, picks, toots his harmonica, and lights up the stage with his voice.

Throughout Black Crow Blue, Nathan's vocals, measured and at times with a grittiness reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, deliver the lyrics with clear-headed certainty of the stories he tells. His descriptive guitar playing, forceful when necessary, provides the clean well-structured melodies that turn his poems to song. In Nathan's writing are songs that encourage the listeners to claim the poetry of our own lives and to find the songs in others'. It's a good way to think about being in this world.",1

"Would Never Recommend I am a fan of Frontline Assembly and KMFDM. This band is awful. I would never recommend to fans of those artists previously mentioned. This is bottom of the barrel music. From the generic non-clever L.S.D. name to the music to their image. It's like Hot Topic b.s. An insult to the electro/industrial/EBM music from the 80s.
The cover lookls like a F.L.A. rip off from their Wax Trax days.
Be original! Again, the music is so awful that only the worst of the worst in horror movies would use and that's not a compliment. They're worse live. I never heard so many people say they wanted their money back. Only people who seemed interested were the drunks.",0

"Unpleasant Valley Sunday Take a jazz pianist of supremely vast talent, harness him to a pop choir that sounds like a laboratory of berserk Doris Day clones, and the result is the kind of thing you won't soon forget.  Jamal's playing -- the only thing to recommend this travesty -- is of minor interest, drowned as it is in lungfuls of saccharine.  Grafted onto the authentic black art of Jamal is a sound like anxious muzak, the bland vocalists trying hard to inject something spirited into their craft as they race uncomfortably to keep up with his arrangements: a very unpleasant valley sunday it is, too.  This is Frankenstein jazz, the component pieces stitched together into a staggering, electrode-popping whole.  I suppose this crossover idea appealed to an industry watching jazz sales decline. (One thinks of Verve around the same time mutilating the late Wes Montgomery's Willow Weep for Me in similar, if far less histrionic fashion.)  A bad turn, but Jamal would quickly return to form with the brilliant The Awakening.",0

"""...but for the sky there are no fences facing..."" -- from ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" The COLUMBIA Special Products 1965 red label LP entitled WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER...WITH THE FOLK SOUND (CSP 280) was a stereo-only release.

Dylan begins his transition to electrifued sound with this classic composition. 4.) Adult Contemporary lullabye is a cowboy's tale of romance that ends tragically.

High-steppin' version of a real oldie has an enthusiasm that's hard to resist. 3.) Strings, solo harp and soothing chorus tarnsform Jimmy's track into a sleep-inducer. 4.)

Pete, his guitar and tapping foot are assisted by an on-stage chorus and the audience on this Woody Guthrie favorite.

"Favorite hymns done in a wonderful The church I attend regularly plays a lot of contemporary music.  I like that, but I also enjoy hearing some of the music I grew up with.  When I visited another church we sang a hymn that I was not familiar with but the words were excellent:

May the mind of Christ my Savior
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow'r controlling all I do and say.

So when I was back home I searched for a CD with this hymn and came across ""Everything Is Sacred.""

The whole CD turned out to be a gem.  My favorite is the first hymn, ""Praise to the Lord, the Almighty"" but all of the songs are great.  I listen to this while I am out for a quiet run in the morning.",1

Five Stars Good album,1
"Few good tracks but falls flat. Honestly, I felt that this album had no effort put into it. The first track ""Follow the Trail of Blood"" was okay, however, I didn't like the vocal mix in Andy's voice for it. Then there's ""F**** Machine"" which has a killer beat which I enjoyed, I also enjoyed ""They"" but the rest, didn't work for me. Luckily, the new album ""We Love You"" is a major improvement. I just got a listen to that.",0
Two Stars Wasn't what I expected.,0
"Cannot Compare to ye Original This is based on the magnificent one-man play, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OSCAR, written and performed by Micheal macLiammoir (1899-1978).  This present recording is an abridgment of the text (which I have in published form from Colin Smythe Ltd), and it cannot compare to the original because no one had as beautiful a voice as macLiammoir (who portrayed Iago in the 1952 Orson Wells cinematic production of Shakespeare's OTHELLO.  I have never found the original recording on cassette or cd (I borrowed the lps from Library and recorded them onto cassette, but this recording by Gerard Plunkett is very good indeed, and it tells, as dramatic performance, the Life and Works of Oscar Wilde.  Wilde is, perhaps, better known today for the story of his life, and there are many fine biographies that tell the tale, as does Peter Ackroyd's debut novel of 1983, THE LAST TESTAMENT OF OSCAR WILDE.  Fascinating as Oscar's life is, it is good to see that his writings are now being taken seriously as works of literary worth (especially with the beautiful hardcover editions from Oxford University Press).  This recording pays as much attention to the writings of Wilde as it does with the story of his life, and the readings from poems, stories, plays and epistles are delightfully performed.  Plunkett's voice is beautiful and dramatic, and Wilde comes to life in this recording.  Highly recommended.",1

Misleading I bought this album thinking I was buying one from Kim Walker of Jesus Culture. Was so disappointed to find it was not. The vocals are really not it. I have to skip the songs every time it comes up on my MP3 player in my car. It wasn't worth the buy for me.,0
"I've never heard a worse lyricist This is the kind of album that I listen to when I need a good laugh. Songs like ""Unless You Call"" and ""Lonely"" are golden opportunities for this.

Therefore, I am not the typical listener for this Kim Walker of ""Lifetimes."" Regardless, this is music that makes me shocked he can make money from it.

I'm a big Mogwai fan, which is why it pains me to say that I don't really dig this track. I just think it's messy and unpleasant sounding, which is the polar opposite of their previous work. I've always been drawn to Mogwai for their cinematic soundtrack-to-your-life kind of sound... but maybe they've gone a little more experimental than usual. Still getting the album, but this first single doesn't get me too excited.

In the meantime, please check out their other albums, like Rock Action, Young Team, and Mr. Beast.",0
"Ear busters Another group that has trouble making music, so they distort most anything that they can to get kids to buy into this as actual music.

"The Musical Equivilent Of a Meteoralogical Phenomenon In many ways I tend to view Klaus Doldinger in a similar way that I do Miles Davis. During his years with the fusion rhythm section Passport Klaus not only played saxaphone and composed all of the music but he also played the other melodic instruments as well such as the electric piano and meletron. Associated with the European music scene to such a degree they never got the type of international audience they probably deserved,Passport began their fifth album on the note of their creatively defining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hand-Made/dp/B001DJ7QC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hand Made</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looking-Thru/dp/B00005RZX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looking Thru</a>&nbsp;albums. The majority of those recordings were journeys to find what they came across here. A lot of people who have managed to discover Passport's wonderful and imaginative type of electric jazz  often describe this as their finest album. Don't know how I feel about that. But I can certainly see why someone might think so.

  For one this album embodies just about all the qualities that make Passport special. There's the dreamy and often abstract nature of the arrangements in these compositions. Also the instrumental choices. The title song is the first example. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes it's an exciting journey from progressive rock type theatrics,into blues and than out and out funk. When Klaus comes in on sax,the sound he produces is rather soft and melodic compared to the phased electric keyboards,synthesizers providing the harmony. It's a beautiful contrast of melody and rhythm. ""Homunculus"" is very rhythmically flamboyant but again never loses that center of instrumental control either. ""Jadoo"" and ""Will-O-Whisp"" on the other hand,perhaps anticipating Doldinger's interest in film scores provide us with blacksploitation influence cinematic funk with a heavy dance orientation as well.

  ""Albatross Song"",with it's breezier rhythm and the spare ballad ""Damals"" showcase the band itself playing in a somewhat more understated manner more in the league of how Klaus himself is playing here. Doldinger is a very moody player/composer. Capble of being brooding and low key one moment and flamboyant to the point of being highly aggressive the next.  The rhythm section of keyboardist Kristian Schultze,bassist/guitarist Wolfgang Schmid and drummer Curt Cress are perfectly attuned to these shifting musical passions he tends to have. Even though they are European and tend to be localized in that area of the world,I still have trouble understanding why their sound never caught on. Maybe it was more that electric jazz/fusion/funk-jazz anywhere had a bit of trouble catching in,on many levels. On the other hand if one is interested in this type of music this definitely stands as an important part of that genre as well as being a strong and important release for Passport as a group.",1

I think that someone, on behalf of all the people living in the China Towns across the US, should lead a charge into whatever recording studio managed to get enough people smacked out of their minds to agree that this should be titled ""music"" and thrust upon the unsuspecting populace. Good thing it was a free download, but I feel someone owes me something for listening to it. I would rather sit in a dumpster in a seedy back alley in any China Town in the US rather than be subjected to this BS.",0
"It is really cool to see projects like the Vitamin String Quartet I thought it would be orchestrated more, it is indeed charming, and brings back the fond memories of growing up with Arcade Fire, however, it does not do it justice in my opinion. It is really cool to see projects like the Vitamin String Quartet, and the performances are accurate and sound pretty good. Not my cup of tea in terms of orchestration though.",0
Five Stars I love this band. Great singer.,1
"Great album! God Bless This Man! NF is the best, I had to buy every album he got out!",1
Five Stars Good quality audio.,1
Sounds cheap and fake like someone rewrote it with an app on their phone NOT the actual version from the trailer. Sounds cheap and fake like someone rewrote it with an app on their phone. Keep searching til you find the actual songs by zach hemsey.,0
"NOT like the original trailer I am a huge fan of the Inception soundtrack. I was royally disgusted after purchasing it that ""Mind Heist"" was not included. So I got really excited when I stumbled across this single .mp3 you can buy.

It was disappointing, and here's why:

It's got the same general tune (and is quite orchestral and beautiful in-and-of itself). But if you want the exact, original feel of the trailer, do NOT buy this one. This one is nice in its own right, but it's definitely a re-recording and not the original from the trailer.

The actual original ""Mind Heist"" can be purchased on Zack Hemsey's website.",0
"disappointing disappointing. it is also not part of the inception album. sample sounded better than whole mp3 so I bought it, but the whole mp3 was disappointing. i would rather buy from the inception album.",0
One Star Yo wtf this is the clean version but it said explicit give me my money back!!!,0

"Great Talent, fun music I just saw these guys at Wheatland Music Festival in Remus, MI - they are incredibly talented!  They have fun, fast-paced music that is sure to get you moving.

"Background and development In fall/winter 2005 Kris wrote several new songs
and recorded/produced my first multi track songs. In
February 2006 his album 'By The End Of Winter' was born.

All songs are 100% home-made productions.
""...Back then I didn't have decent recording equipment,
so the result became a complete Unplugged Album.""

The motivation of writing songs again came due to the
fact that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over.
You can hear that especially in the song
'Past In The End'. I think that's what made the
sound of the songs quite unique and authentic.

If you like what you hear, you can support
him by buying the album or only single songs.",1
"Afro Punk before the Bad Brains This is an excellent album. This band should have been a lot more famous and not relegated to obscurity. It's a mixture of heavy metal guitars and riffs mixed with punk speed and rhythm. These guys originally formed in Philadelphia in 1974 and then moved to NYC in the late seventies. They played live with the Sex Pistols and Dead Boys. Kurtis Knight, former band-mate and author of Jimmy Hendrix's biography, was their manager. If you are a fan of heavy metal and punk music, this is an album worth owning.",1
"Proceed With Care... This is a LOW BITRATE RIP (RIPOFF) of the album. You will be disappointed at the horrible quality of what sounds like possibly a good album. I can't tell for sure--and I'm a fan of the band, DO NOT BUY THIS unless you are desperate.",0
"Enjoying James Blunt with some favorites on my Cloud... If you are a James Blunt fan then you surely already own this album. His newest album he explores some songs with a different twist. Moon Landing has a few songs which explore the space race, (Not a new topic, of course) with some interesting songs and interesting messages. You don't need to enjoy space exploration to enjoy the new album. The music in this album is amazing and I play it over and over with the rest of his awesome albums. I have most on my cloud and they play for ever and I'm a happy happy fan.",1
"A legend in the music world, Diamond Dave Sommerville First - contrary to above information there are images of this album available and there is an album available.
I started work in the music business in 1972, working in the art department of the also legendary Charles Hanson music folios UK office.  My second job was with the American, however, living in the UK, Bob Wise, a remarkable man who revolutionized the world of music folios. And on a more personal note a man who treated me as an equal, and as a woman, someone with intelligence. He was a fine mentor.
So I learned a lot about music and songs putting folios together, and if you google me, you will find my name lised alongside others for various music folios.
Album starts off with Dave's speaking about joining the 1957 The Greyhound Bus Tour (60 days) and he finds himself sitting with Chuck Berry. The opening track is a Chuck Berry Medley.  And Dave does them justice.
As he does with all the other great songs he recorded including Summetime Blues, The Everyly Brothers' medley, Buddy Holly medley, The Drifters, a conversation with Buddy Holly, Fats Domino and other stars also on the bus.
Dave adds dialogue throughout the album and it's interesting to share in the history of a remarkable tour, with so many stars on a bus together.
If you want a history lesson of a time in music when much changed, this is an album you should have in your collection.
And Dave ends his 40 song album with a great version of ""Little Darlin'""  and ""do we have time for one more....""

I have added images from the 8 page cover insert/booklet.  Under Munday Images.",1
"Liked the movie, loved the music! Glad to be able to get this song! And I love that it is available through cloud to put on any device.",1
SMOOTH AND GOOD Gabriela Anders has a smooth voice and it's highlighted well on this track and all of the tracks on her album. Her jazzy and melodic tone blends well with the wonderful music. This is a must buy and listen.,1
Five Stars Awesome!,1
"Very good tour I would have given the tour 5 stars but I think the tour needs updating.  One of the first houses on the audio tour was used in FX's American Horror series but no mention of this was on the recording.  We found out from other people visiting the garden district.

The information and stories of the houses was very good.",1

"Beautiful song, great singer/songwriter Really beautiful song, great singer/songwriter. As good as or better than some that are out there.  Have bought several other songs from this artist and love them all.",1
"In the top two This is a review of the song, not the album.  There are a number of good versions of ""All Blues"" out there.  It is a great song that has inspired many.  To my mind, this Ron Carter version is in the top two, along with the Miles/Coltrane original.  So smooth, so warm, like a shot of really good butterscotch schnapps.  Makes you feel wonderful all over.",1

AMAZING! This is a great worship album. It's simple and beautiful. I have loved Darlene for years but she is as close to perfect as she will probably ever be on this side of heaven. You have to listen to it for yourself.,1

"Not Nicki!!! I guess it's partially my fault for not reading the other review before buying this, but who would think that the song is misrepresented!  Disappointed that the song does not include Nicki as stated.",0

"Masterpiece I didn't get there last cd, but I heard some songs from this on youtube and on a whim bought it, I had no idea what to expect, but what I am playing all the time at home, in my car and at work is pure bliss, this cd blends the brutality with soft passages perfectly, there is no weak track on this cd, music like this does not come around very often, i'm mesmerized at the brilliance of the cd, you don't have to like this band to buy this, you just have to like metal... if you do not end up liking this cd at the end of your first spin, your the one with issues .. lol.. unless something else comes out of left field and surprises the heck out of me, this is gonna end up being my Cd of the year, I know Amon Amarth is coming out soon and so is Mercenary but damn if they don't have there work cut out for them, this cd is a monster, it's epic, it's everything you hope for when you buy any cd and it's all on this one... Thank you Omnium Gatherum...",1
Two Stars My mom like it so got for her,0
Not my kind of music My husband bought this and I don't care for it.  I think he likes it.  He may never get arouond to evaluating it.,0
Yeah... He's Right... Pretty Crap! The other review is pretty on about this. Don't waste your dough. Find his first 3 discs or his Weather Report stuff.,0
"Don't Bother Obviously just my opinion, but you'd think that someone as acclaimed as Bailey is and who's been around as long as he has could make better music.  It truly sounds like something a kid made in his basement - sort of a talented, but mindless wankery. I've heard play-along tracks that were way better musically, and had better groove. Seriously. It's just pathetic.

Really trite, predictable stuff. Plus the titles are terrible. Who names a song Ape School? I guess it's all subjective though. If you want to hear Victor Bailey play, go buy a copy of Weather Report's - Procession, or check out his Trio stuff with Larry Coryell and Lenny White.  This stuff, you can truly pass on.

Jaco, I miss you so...",0

"If you like the song but don't like the vocals try the ... Doug Robb comes across as a nasally high pitched whine in this, does not complement the pairing of Apocalyptica at all.

If you like the song but don't like the vocals try the same one with Brent Smith, much better than this guy.",0
"Stick with Brent Smith Doug Robb's vocals are simply too underwhelming for Apocalyptica. Why this version of the song even exists, I do not know.

The song itself is still good, though; so I rate it 2 stars.",0

"mine not subliminal dude I can crank up the volume all the way on player(sansa clip+ w/rockbox) and of course you hear mild hissing, but you can also hear the voice of the guy talking...it is a little muffled, but you can definitely hear it and understand what is being said, and I have a moderate amount of tinnitus, too.  lower volume on player and you can't hear it any more.  whether that will do any good or not, I do not know. Neither ultra silent nor subliminal.  but hey it is only .99 and I figured I wasn't risking much.  maybe it is just my copy....",0
Not the original band. Terrible. It's Chris hall singing but the music is terrible.,0
"It's the singer, but not the band Posted this on a smaller release of this EP so I thought I would share the same results here, as this is just a more expanded version of the release.

I bought ""Save Yourself"" on iTunes to give it a listen and check it out. It was the most horrible version of the song I have ever heard.

After some research, I found out that it is indeed Christopher on vocals, but the ones performing the music has no ties with the band, Stabbing Westward. I even contacted Cleopatra Records, who informed me that it is Chris but not the remaining members.

I'm sorry I purchased just the one song. The worst song purchase I have ever made.

Cleopatra Records has a history of releasing stuff like this. They just recently released a ""Trapt"" album titled ""Headstrong."" Again, the vocalist, but doesn't sound like the band.

This EP is not only an insult to the band, as they really had no hand it's release, but an insult to the fans.",0

"Pretty inconsequential As a great fan of the Strawbs, I purchased the original Hudson-Ford and Dave Cousins
lps as soon as they appeared, and have retained them and a number of other lps simply because they were never issued on cd. As much mediocre stuff as HAS returned, when something HASN'T there must be a reason. Other than contractual
problems, the reason is usually that the material is pretty thin. Indeed, there are about 5-6 songs worth listening to on the three albums combined, and none of them come close to Hudson and Ford's compositions on the Strawbs' 'Bursting' and 'Grave
New World' albums. Dave Cousins' ""Suddenly Last Summer"" is no great find either.
If you like the genre, stick to the Strawbs reissues; the notes by Dave Cousins are especially enlightening. It's also difficult but possible to find a DVD of their
""Grave New World"" movie which is a real 'blast from the past'.",0

I thought at first that it might be outside, but after a repeat listening and taking the headphones off to check, the airplane sounds are definitely on the rain clip.  It was very distracting to me and ruined the whole ""relaxation"" aspect of the rain sounds.  That is too bad, as I was really enjoying the rain sounds on this particular recording.

Hard tune to find I've been looking for this single literally for years! It's a very nice tune based on a Beethoven melody.

"amazing This is one of those rare cd's that you can put it on the first track and listen completely through it without skipping one song. also you can listen to these songs over and over, i've all of them 100 times easy and i still love listening to them. also a little side note, their concerts are amazingly fun and i can't wait for the 31st.",1

Cracked CD case The CD case came cracked.,0
Music format not my choice This very fine group was on mp3 format. My personal opinion is that  purist will not hear the richness of their music.. The banjo has a tinny sound instead of the grand full impact that is prominent in mountain music.,0
"Good album from great band Not as good as Border Crossing studio album (which is one of my favorite albums of any group all time IMHO), but still has great live music.  If Throwback ever gets back together someone email me.  Most amazing combination of vocals and solid instrumentation.  Would drive halfway across the continent to see them live.",1
Fantastic song. This was one of those songs I hadn't heard in years. It just popped into my head a few weeks ago and I found it and downloaded it. I was glad it did because this was one of my favorite songs when I was a kid.,1
"What will the music industry come up with next? I cannot stand the new music that is out today.  I feel like I'm in a constant fist pumping club.  Pop music is now club music, as much of a fan that I have always been of Britney, I am not liking this new sound at all.",0
"She's back! Ever since we had 3 out near the end of '09, I've been waiting for new music from Britney. And finally, it's here. Can't wait for her new album to come out real soon.

There is ONE thing that I wasn't happy about. Her record company had it exclusively on another site one week before the official release. I guess that was okay but most of us had to wait until the official day to purchase it. If Jive Records was smart enough to bring the official release a week early instead of having it just an iTunes exclusive thing, I'm pretty that she would have more sales with the song. Not a lot of people use iTunes.  Good marketing technique but not good enough. Either way, I'm just glad to have this song.

Now, to wait for her new album to hit the stores!",1
New singer/songwriter She is wonderful! She writes her songs. She plays her songs beautifully.  She sings her songs. She has a great voice! Hope it isn't too long before we hear more from her!,1

"Too distracting for a beginner. I was looking for some mindfulness meditations for a group of college students.  This ain't it.  The reader's voice is androgynous and distracting, almost grating at times.  He sounds like an amateur who made this on his home computer, and he says things like ""allow the world to fill you up"" and talks about tension in the inner thighs.  Sure to elicit giggles instead of mindfulness.  Waste of a buck.",0
Five Stars Great arrangements of classic Christmas music.  Wonderful collection,1

"Hello, Tcherepnin It's fascinating that Mr. Tcherepnin seems to not be on anyone's radar.  Certainly he wasn't on mine until two weeks ago, but he's a wonderful composer and all his music - symphonies and concert music, is worth seeking out.  This disc is delightful - good sound and clarity and the music is tuneful and fun.",1

"New Talent? I think so! Ty Stone is a talent, that isn't completed developed yet, but Man, is there potential here! Heard this song performed live in Jackson, MS as Ty opened for Jamey Johnson and Kid Rock, and he really delivered.

But Amazon got my money, so I guess that's all that matters.",0
"The Whiffenpoofs .... Really?? I give one extra star because the singers are actually talented.  But seriously this is nothing more than barber shop.  I just can't give high marks to people that torture what was once someone else's good song.  I know some people loooooove barber shop, but then some folks like mimes.",0
"Overall pleasant Really, more of a 3 1/2 star piece.  However, I found this version of The Final Countdown delightful enough to err on the side of generosity.

A collection of a capella or lightly accompanied songs.  Except for Baby, which I find to be an extraordinarily annoying song apart from this album, all the songs rate at least pleasant.  Many of the songs reach all the way to quite good, and a few were absolutely delightful.

I have listened to it extensively since purchase (admittedly only four hours ago, but it's been looping ever since) and am not yet tired of the album.  It features quite a bit of internal variety and has an overall light tone.

I would definitely recommend listening to the samples before making a decision.  As taken with the overall effect as I am, it is certainly not for everyone.",1
"I'm speechless Wow, yet another in a long line of daily bargain albums literally nobody with functioning ears would want.  Bad singers from a bad TV show warbling bad songs while hundreds of deserving artists go unheard and unrecognized.  I'd rather listen to my vacuum cleaner.",0

"Great, except for minor sound glitches. This is old stuff.  I really enjoyed the writing.  Very gritty and realistic.  The one drawback is that occasionally, the audio is interrupted and a previous portion of the episode plays for a few seconds.  It is VERY annoying, but I was always able to follow what was going on, throughout all 50 episodes.  Great characters.  Lots of good listening time.  Made for some very entertaining work time.",1

"Entertaining Rock I am a baseball fan so this is entertaining to me.  While I enjoy the music, it is not my style.  However I enjoy the Baseball Project simply for the story in the song.  This song is no different.  It is a good story and a person can learn a little about baseball by listening to their songs.  However as I listen to it when I write this review, I find myself cringing about the music but sucked into listening to the lyrics.  This is a five star review simply becuase I am a baseball fan and enjoy hearing a good baseball story.  If this song had lyrics about barbies or trucks I would simply hate it.  I have heard their entire first album and enjoyed the songs but I do not remember the singing being this disappointing.",1

Amazing Band I love their sound and can't wait to see them live in my home city. Their sound is roots rock and is real original. Get the album now !!! Heard them on NPR and surprised they aren't all over the place. Just give it another year.,1

One Star Not that great. Would not buy it again.,0
"I first heard this beautiful song at The Seraphim Center I first heard this beautiful song at The Seraphim Center. We sang it to one person at a time as we walked around the church, looking into each other's eyes while holding their hands. It's only 4 lines long, sung over and over. It was a powerful exercise to remind us that we are more alike than we are different. ""I'm willing to open my eyes, to see your innocence, to see the child you are, a mirror of myself."" This is on an older album of Donna Marie Cary's  and one of my favorites.",1
"Where is the music??? This CD consists ONLY of the chaconne, that is of 9 or 11 minutes of music. Nothing more!!! That is nuts. It cost $16!
I think it was T S Eliot or W H Auden, maybe both, or Ezra Pound. Anyway someone said to be a convincing writer, be judicious in your use of exclamation points. But this ripoff elicits exclamations!
p.s. The music itself is stunning. Five star.",0

"I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite I remember this as being the best prtformance of the Fetite Suite.  Gut only 28 minutes on a CD???  I can think of lots of things that would increase the value. The lack of notes is not a problem for me.  Anyone who is going to seek this item out doesn't care about notes.

What would be an absolutely wonderful thing for this label to do is the first performance of Sheherazade by the conductor Issay Dobrowen.  It is 58 minutes of unmatcheable interpretation including a 20 minute second movement which because of its total spontaniety doesn't sound slow at all.  In fact its the best movement of a fabulously natural performance.  What EMI reissued a couple of years ago is the more politically correct 47 minute performance which still is very good indeed.  But, if you want the ultimate by a conductor steeped in this music . . . . . . . ?

And then, there are the Glazounov 2nd, 3rd and 5th symphonies conducted by the vastly underrated Boris Khaikin.  the 2nd and 3rd, for sure, are superior to anything done since. Released in the 70s by EMI records in excellent stereo.

And for more, the first recordings ever of the Prokofiev 2nd and 3rd symphonies with Charles Bruck conducting a razor edged French Orchestra seemingly made to order for this overwhelmingly powerful music which has since been tamed by many conductors but never presented as excitingly as this! A French Columbia recording c1960.

Needless to say I would buy these without hesitation as my LPs are kind of worn.",1
"Nice music, but what a rip off $15 odd for 10 minutes of the D major guitar concerto. Nice music, but what a rip off.
Shame of you Amazon!",0
Poor recording This is a techically poor recording.  Some of the choruses cut out before they end.  The lead singers are mediocre.  I do not recommend buying.,0
"What Can I Say? Having attempted to listen to this CD twice, I wish I could say something positive about this CD. Thirty years ago I first heard this recreation on an LP by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. That was a tour-de-force! This effort is decidedly 2nd class. The orchestra certainly tries hard, but is not up to the challenge. The recording itself sounds like something that came out of Russian during the 60's. It's very tinny and closely miked. As for the conductor, it's either Alberto Lizzio or Alfred Scholtz (Both are shown on different labels of the same work).

If you want to hear this unique work, the recording of it by Neeme Jarvi and the London Philharmonic is fairly rewarding. That recording, on the Chandos label, is coupled with Tchaikovsky's 3rd piano concerto. But, for my money, try to find the LP of Ormandy and the Philadelphians.",0
Five Stars great album,1
Not my favorite by the NMAS Shake hands with shorty is a five star masterpiece. The boys are amazing live. I appreciate their dedication to keeping the delta blues alive but I think they lost their way a bit on this one.,0
"This vinyl was not a 180gram product! I purchased this vinyl because it was said to be a 180gram stock, but to my amazement it turned out to be a 140gram vinyl. I had never opened the package and I could tell easily that it was not what it was supposed to be. ImportCDS almost immediately gave me a credit for this item and this was even before I had returned the record to them. I would have to give them a 5 star rating for checking into my complaint and acting in my favor quickly! Thank you! I could not tell you if the music is as good as I had heard it to be, I never had the chance to listen to it!",0

"Honestly, I couldn't care less whether it sounds EXACTLY like ives. What IS wonderful about this is how it brings out everything in this piece, from the extreme beauty that Ives could evoke, to profound disillusionment at points. The orchestration may be nothing like Ives, but the fact is that Ives' orchestration is IVES' orchestration, unique to that composer's voice, and impossible to replicate at will. The playing is impeccable, and it is really a matter of opinion whether you consider this or Dennis Russell Davies' version definitive. It is a little faster paced in spots, and a little more clean, but the Davies version is interpreted differently. As for the Copland Organ Symphony, there is no doubt about it. This is amazing music, and everybody who has any interest in American music deserves to hear it.",1

"A sub-par recording As another reviewer noted, the volume on this recording is very low. Also, the recording seems muddy, lacking the clarity you'd expect from a good modern recording. This was most noticeable in ""La fontana di Trevi al meriggio"", which also seemed to take a slightly sluggish tempo.

In ""I pini di Villa Borghese"" many notes in the famous horn part were either inaudible or omitted. It just plain doesn't sound right. The recording also ended on a bad note, with a trumpet hanging over on the final release of ""I pini della Via Appia"". I will give some credit and say that I did enjoy this recording of ""Pini presso una catacomba"".

On the whole, it's not a terrible recording, but there are much better options out there.",0

"A remake of a good song. A remake of a good song, however, no one can compare to Cory Daye's original recording and this version definitely was NOT an improvement. The singers voice was too light, too airy and came off as weak for those of us who wanted/expected Cory D's version.",0
"Pleasant and Professional I have purchased several of the Global Hypnosis MP3 downloads as well as self hypnosis CDs and MP3s by other artists (Steven Gurgevich, Erick Brown, Glen Harrold, etc..).  The Global Hypnosis CDs have a very nice induction period, which is long (excluding the extra ""Relaxer"" track) compared to that of many hypnosis CDs out there.  The voice is very relaxing. Some people might find the ""sound over"" (new age, storms and water flow) to be a little loud on these recordings.  The hypnosis session is really split over 2 tracks and lasts about an hour.  The suggestive script is split onto the 2nd and 3rd tracks.  The only complaint I would have is that there is a relatively long break in the suggestive script at the end of the 2nd track and the beginning of the 3rd track.

This is my favorite of the Global Hypnosis CDs.  I would definitely recommend it.",1

I was in the middle of driving from Ga to Tx and was in an area where I'd lost radio signal so I when I saw Greatest R&B Hits, I just knew I'd found some great songs to help keep me comfortable during my drive. First song was Nellie, I was like why is he on here and why does he sound so funny? Next song, still wondering why the artist sounded funny. After the 3rd song I exited the freeway to see what was wrong. I honestly thought something was wrong w/my hearing! Lol How do I go about getting my $ back?!",0

"A mostly mellow Jazz album from Johnny with R&B undertones. This is a great album of jazz standards. I have lots of jazz LPs and this I would rank at near top of the list and gets played most frequently. Although Johnny is considered an R&B artist and later had a Funk period he does an outstanding job singing these early standards. Not much of his guitar playing comes through on this (Zappa names him as his #1 influence) but a great album non the less. A perfect album all the way through. There's not a bad cut on it , great for those mellow moods except for one song (Reconsider Baby side2 track 3) which is up tempo and performed in a more traditional R&B manner Johnny was known for in the 50s.",1

My husband and I both love it and purchased it  with a grateful heart. God bless The Red  Mountain Music ministry  and  the man who sang this song.",1

"A Must-Buy! Why Devin isn't already out there all over everyone's radar is beyond me, because he has the raw talent, the grungy, rock sound and the earnest lyrics that so many are searching for. I usually tend to gravitate to one or two songs on an album, but I am finding the whole record consistently on repeat, and to be honest, I can not find a favorite among the group...each track has its own ""personality"" and keeps me hooked to my speakers for the album's entirety. I highly recommend this cd, and also recommend checking out his older ones, too. :)",1

"Lukewarm synthpop Peter Baumann was a member of Tangerine Dream, a German band that was amongst the pioneers in the use synthesizers to explore new soundscapes. His first two solo albums Romance 76 and Trans Harmonic Nights were instrumental. In 1981 the vocal album Repeat Repeat was released and Strangers In The Night of 1983 is the disappointing follow-up. The vocals sound flat and it lacks the catchy tunes and synth-pop savoir fair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Repeat-Repeat/dp/B000WQ9VQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Repeat Repeat</a>.

The title track is the cover of a Bert Kaempfert composition from 1966. The lack of melodies renders this album forgettable although there are one or two exceptions where the earlier genius shines through. Time Machine, for example, contains a hint of the symphonic splendor of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trans-Harmonic-Nights/dp/B001D797JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trans Harmonic Nights</a>&nbsp;whilst there a remnant of his engaging synth textures on Taxi.

The concluding Welcome is the only memorable track on this uninspiring album as it does have a great melody and impressive atmospheric arrangement with a cohesive structure. For great synth-pop that equals the best of e.g. Human League, Eurythmics and OMD, I recommend Repeat Repeat. The compilation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phase-By-Phase/dp/B000007TWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phase By Phase</a>&nbsp;offers a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks that display a few of Baumann's greatest triumphs.",0

Excellent!! If you love folk and Alaskan music this is the best you will ever own.,1
"Sourdough pioneers in the Alaskan music scene Don Schultz, Loren Arment, Goodwin Trent, Dana Cox, and Kathryn Cox were the artist that made up this groundbreaking Alaskan folk band from the 1970's.  Don Schultz's impeccable banjo carried many of their tunes, along with the lilting voice of Dana Cox and the superb harmonies of Loren, Kathryn, and Goodwin. The producer, John Speer, did a remarkable job of arranging and recording the music along with Don Schultz.  The Last Frontier Band is and was the first band to really set the bar for Alaskan recording artists, and I have yet to see an album of its caliber since.  Except of course, Dana Cox's solo album from the 1980's.
The folk standard Wayfarin' Stranger, is enchanting.  Trees, written by Goodwin Trent is a classic flower child song of the time period. Traveling Lady, sung by Dana Cox is haunting. Save The Whales, sung to the tune of The Drunken Sailor inspires dreams of the good ole days when the whales were hunted almost to extinction.  A few years ago, I contacted John Speer about re-releasing this album on CD, but that has yet to come about.",1

"Outstanding While I have the excellent studio recording of the Sutherland-Pavarotti ""La Sonnambula"", this live recording of early Sutherland is spectacular.  Her high notes are off the chart and her diction is rather good compared to her later years.  Not listening to ""La Sonnambula"" often, one forgets what great music is in this wonderful Bellini opera.  A ""must have"" for any Sutherland and ""La Sonnambula"" lover.",1

"Great J-pop / J-rock album ~ Listen to the previews here and decide.

I enjoy this album because it's not too 'pop' sounding.  The vocals never get too tinny or 'cutesy' sounding.  Instead it's a nice mix of light rock, pop, and punk that has very nice variety.  It's a steal at under $10 for the download.  I put it on the Amazon cloud then loaded it to my computer, iPod Shuffle (for running), and my phone.  I really did the tunes while running or working out.  The quicker tempos make for a nice upbeat workout mix.

Wish more American bands were like this!",1
"Best album in the universe. Confab's ear socket searing riffs melted my mind with their technicality, and the melodies and hooks were like that of an angelic phonic goddess, caressing my soul with her inconceivably luscious auditory arms that wrapped themselves around me, like a warm blanket on a cold day.. comforting me in this post-apocalyptic rock suck-o-sphere that has become the music industry today. God bless you, Confab.",1

"This is special Many have written here that this is not the best collection of Bruce Cockburn's work. I'm not a mind reader or a seer, so I'm thinking those are evaluations made by people who have always had easy access to his recorded music. I, and I'd guess many others, have not had that easy access. My work life has always kept me in places where his music was not available. I don't have all of Mr Cockburn's albums in my collection. So, what does this all mean? Simply that I am absolutely satisfied with this collection of Bruce Cockburn's music. There are many songs in this collection that I've never heard. They are as good as all the music I've become familiar with in years previous. If you're a person who has collected most, if not all, of Mr Cockburn's music, you may be disappointed with this anthology. If you're someone like me, without that all encompassing collection, I'll bet that you'd enjoy this compilation immensely. I'll be listening to this one until it's no longer playable. I gave it five stars. I mean it.",1
"I have purchased every single release of Bruce's. The ... I have purchased every single release of Bruce's.  The message I get is that if I want the concert DVD and rarities disc, I have to pay well over $100.  Bruce's marketing team has found a way to thumb their noses to the core of his fan base.  Curious.",0
"Great Music - Horrible Box Set Five stars for the music.  One star for the absence of consideration to avid fans that went into this box set.  There are many rarities that are still ""out there"" that could have been included, and which would have brought something fresh to this collection. Instead, you get 6 CD's of music that has been available for years on the official releases; one disc of ""rarities"", although many of these supposed rarities are available on other compilations that are readily available; and a single DVD of an acoustic tour that Bruce did a few years ago.  Talk about a missed opportunity!  How difficult would it have been to include missing B sides that never made it to CD?  Or rarities that are only available on hard-to-find and out-of-print CD's?  And why not include a DVD of the movie ""Rumours of Glory"" that came out in the 80's, or any number of other live performances that would have made fantastic DVD's?  Bruce is a significant artist with some very devoted fans.  They deserve more than this wasted opportunity to produce a meaningful box set.  Thumbs up for the music.  Thumbs down for the absence of imagination that went into this once in a career box set.

NOTE: After receiving in the mail the AMAZING Wilco box set that was just released this week, I have had to lower my review of Bruce's box set.  Wilco shows what it is like to approach fans with imagination and integrity.  Bruce's team rather shrewdly was able to convince a fan like me to spend over $100 for a single CD of music of ""rarities"" -- many of which I already own -- and a DVD.  They didn't do a fraction of the work that Wilco's team did.  Wilco's box set is NOTHING BUT RARITIES.  It is amazing.  Bruce's songs and guitar playing and voice are also amazing, but his team has put together a box set that is not worth the support of fans who deserve more.",0
Two Stars Slow tunes overall ok not wonderful,0
"Same as U.S. 12"" This being an import I am assuming it's either going to be the German or the French 12"". Either way the tracks are all identical to the U.S. release. There is nothing worth getting on this 12"" vinyl you can't get on the original album unless you are a remix freak. Trust me. The remix (or dance version) isn't worth it. You get three tracks:

- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Special ""Red & Blue"" Remix Dance Version)

This is considered a very rare track, but it's a mess. It's has a strong vibe on it similar to Dazz Band's Let it Whip along with various pacing breaks, sample clips (including a popular Art of Noise voice sample), and other distractions put in between normal spots of the song. It's an irritating club mix that runs a little over seven minutes.

- Owner Of A Lonely Heart (Edited Version)

Just a single mix of the album version. It's about a minute shorter than the album version and feels a bit stunted because of it. Although I admit it does hit all the important marks, but you miss some cool instrumentation.

- Our Song

This is the exact same version as what's found on the 90125 album.

If you are a major Yes fan and need all the mixes (including the bad ones) then I suppose you will find value in this 12"". Everybody else just pass it up.",0

Both Groups Are Awesome! OK!, another One? OK! ""The Plastic Cloud"" on Allied Records, and the songs are, ""Face Behind The Sun"", ""Shadows Of Your Mind"", ""Dainty General Rides"", ""Civilization Machine"" and ""You Don't Care""! One More? OK!, ""Cosmic Dealer"" on Negram Records! The Killer Songs are, ""Head In The Clouds"", ""Daybreak"", ""Find Your Way"", ""Child Of The Golden Sun"", ""I Had A Friend"" and ""The Scene""! Might as well throw in the ""SINGLE ONLY"" of ""Cosmic Michael"" on Radioactive  ( Bliss ) Records with ""Cosmic Michael Theme"" b/w ""Now That I Found It""! Thanks!!!",1

"Strange Remix I bought it because I like the One Winged Angel song off of both Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, but this has got to be the weirdest remix I've ever heard. I wouldn't suggest it at all.",0
"A true fallacy of fandom and appreciation. A homage is a tribute a fan pays to a certain person or thing in respects to the original work without profiteering from the work. It is free. It is available to all. And it is easily accessible. Even Voices of the Lifestream is free. This is not free. This is a fallacy. It should be reported to Square-Enix and to Uematsu for Copyright infringment.

Beyond that, lets look at this from a Musical Critic's perspective:

It doesn't even seem like it took these guys longer than a day to make this. All the songs' raps sound exactly the same. Just listen to the demo. They didn't even remix the background songs they used to rap over. It's laughable really. It's like a few guys in their basement using a re-mixing program to produce, well, crap.

This is isn't rapping. It's crapping. And I am not saying that to get on anyone's nerves. It's true. It's easily ascertainable. ""Oh man, so many tribute albums, this is the best one!"" No. It's not. Not even for the Rap genre. But what bothers me the most is that the people who made this had the audacity to put up for sale on Amazon. It's not worth 9 dollars. No tribute is. No homage is. Why? Because the true fan doesn't wish to see a profit from their fandom. They do it as fans.

And these fans aren't good rappers. And I know good rap. I enjoy rap. So Final Fantasy/Rap lovers, understand I am judging this based on my opinion of rap. This is just... bad. Hell, Will Smith can make better raps than this.

You want a true homage from great fan-artists? Just Youtube it. You don't have to pay for it. And you don't have subject yourself to this garbage.",0

His voice wasn't assuring and words weren't what I feel I needed, ""Imagine what you would be doing if you were confident."" Really, I expected more than that.",0

"Give Yiruma some credit for this gem. This song is really ""River Flows in You"" by Yiruma with an overlay that is downright atrocious. Yiruma on the other hand is a terrific pianist that I would recommend to any who enjoy quality music. If you got here tracking down ""bella's lullaby"" this is not from the movie. Go get the real soundtrack, if on the other hand, you are looking for a beautiful solo piano piece, go check out River Flows in You on Youtube or Itunes (amazon doesn't have it at this time.)",0
"Poorly Produced, Distracting The narrator has a very relaxing voice and the music overlay is pleasant. That's all the good I can say about this track. There are multiple narrated audio tracks overlayed over each other. At some points the narrator talks over himself. At other times there is noise in the room such as objects dropping on a desk, or other noises in the room. Very distracting.",0
"Increased RPM for Stepping I loved this song from 1990 called You & Me by Jamm and had been looking for it to purchase or download since it's out of print and thought I had hit the jackpot when I found it here on Amazon for download. However I was disappointed after I downloaded it and realized it didn't sound as I remembered it then after closer review, It occurred to me that the RPM has been increased to be more appropriate for ""stepping"" (a form of line dancing). So if you don't mind the increase in speed, help yourself. As for me the hunt continues for this unsung Hit from 1990. By the way smooth jazz saxophonist George Howard covered it on his ""Personal"" album",0
"Heartfelt, genuine and an absolute work of art I'm not usually one to listen to this type of music, but I've been lucky enough to get to know Matt (the genius behind the music) and to see him perform. He truly has a gift and the songs he composes are heartfelt and genuine. Mutual friends and acquaintances had always raved about how talented he is, and when I got a chance to hear his music myself I was captivated and bought a copy of his CD immediately. I do have a few favorite tracks, but I would be lying if I said there were any that are less than brilliant. You can preview the tracks and see for yourself, but I highly encourage everyone to support him and buy a copy. You won't be disappointed!",1
One Star The audio doesn't play at all and I like that song. Please fix the audio,0
so bad I like to pretend Grendel never made this album. Try synthetic generation.,0
"new direction = wrong turn Wow.  I can't recall ever being so shocked and dismayed by a once-great act dropping such a stink bomb of this magnitude.  By stripping out the distortion on the vocals, Grendel reveals not only a puny, strangulated, wanna-be tough/emo voice, but also lyrics that are so childish and silly, I was embarrassed to be listening.  Even worse, the songs consist of nothing but choruses- the same three lines repeated over and over, and then the choruses themselves are repeated over and over.  In other words, each song has about three lines, total, each of which is repeated three times within a chorus, and the chorus is repeated about six times within the song...and lines themselves are utterly cheesy and stupid.

Furthermore, this idiot has done what so many other Goth/Industrial losers have-- given his girlfriend way too much space on the album-- her monotone ""robo-girl"" interjections are particularly annoying.

I suspected that Grendel's last album, Harsh Generation, was a little too cheesy and commercialized, but I chose to ignore those aspects.  Unfortunately, every silly and ridiculous aspect of Harsh Generation has only been enhanced and expanded upon with this new single.  This release is just pure garbage that is a disgrace to the genre.

Check out Aesthetic Perfection's new one, A Violent Emotion, for an example of how harsh electro/ebm/industrial can continue to evolve and stay vital, and stay away from this stinking cheese pile by Grendel.",0

"Cool Swedish band from the early 90's Road Ratt were another unfairly overlooked melodic rock band from the early 1990's. Much like Treat, Damned Nation and Nasty Idols, these guys never achieved any fame outside their native land, but that's not saying they shouldn't have.

Road Ratt's sound is kin to what the Electric Boys were doing at the time. Some people call this funk rock, but there really aren't too many traces of funk on this record in my own opinion. The production is typical Swedish, with over-the-top sounds and choruses, and the songs are just as catchy as ever. How the Swedes continue to pump out such quality hard rock, even till this day, is far beyond me. While I wouldn't call this essential, or even five-star, it does have some really cool melodic rock songs. I liked ""Use The Lighter,"" ""Ragman City,"" ""Beggars Day"" and ""Turn Me On;"" the rest was decent, but there was also some filler that crept in as well.

I think every melodic rock fan should check this record out. Buying the actualy cd is ridiculous due to limited supply they made, but downloading it is like nine dollars. I would definitely go that route fellow rockers, and everyone check this out quick!",1

"Bend your ear, sweet son... The Spider Hole is one of those bands that defy categorization, as only the best do.  If nothing else, its eccentric rock the sort of rock with impeccable style, that wears a fedora, bursts unexpectedly through the haze of a smoky club and sways its hips with a swinging, boozy groove, sometimes foul-mouthed but always charming.  It both compliments and intrudes upon your melancholy thoughts with gratifying irreverence.

The lyrics can be absurd and surreal--but even at their extremes, they are too poetic to be entirely gratuitous.  They are dream-like, driving in pace along with the music, and you could just enjoy the sound of them and the clever turns of phrase, if you like.  But if you really listen you might get the sense that youve fallen down a rabbit hole of some punkish film noir series, with mysterious characters and strange story-telling.  The lead singers voice is both wild and precise, with such a daring stylistic range that you nearly imagine it to be more than one person.

For a debut album this is an incredible offering -- every song is solid and the album is tight in production and coherent in tone.  Excellent guitar, bass, drums along with whimsical piano riffs, the occasional horn, and various effects that all add to the mood at just the right times.  It would be impossible to pick one favorite or standout among so many strong tracks.  Not a single weak song to be skipped.  In fact, its still, many years after its initial release, one of my all-time favorite albums to play all the way through.  Its darkly theatrical and a lot of fun to move to.

To sum up... Holy sh** this band is awesome!  Buy this album and you will have a hidden gem of musical mischief with which to while away the dull hours and impress your friends with!  The Spider Hole stands alone -- there is no other band quite like them.

Enjoy.

(Its also worth the effort to track down the band and give them some love and cash to snag a copy of their newest album Royal Spend, which is just as great but unavailable on Amazon as of this writing.)",1

Still his best song George Michael is one of those naturally talented singers and performers and regardless of who you are attracted to you can't deny his charisma with this song or the music video. He is a great performer and this is just a fun enjoyable song!,1
This is a BAD track! It leaves out a line and screws ... This is a BAD track! It leaves out a line and screws the singer up horribly! I am going to ask for my $ back!!!,0
Five Stars Love this song and so does my four month old,1
"Missing section.  Not the original This might have been fine, except a whole sentence of the accompaniment was missing, leaving a critical hole in the song.  We bought a replacement from Christian Book Distributors.",0
it's missing a line i want my money back this is the second track I bought that is missing the same line! Ultimate tracks is also missing the same line,0
"Seems faster than the original song I was not pleased with this soundtrack because it seems as though the music was playing at a faster speed than the original song.  Maybe I just need to listen to the original song again as I am used to singing the song via keyboard at church.; but even so, it still seemed like it was too fast.  Perhaps ther was a mistake in the downloading process.",0
"IT IS MISSING A LINE! I wish I would have read the reviews, because IT IS MISSING A LINE!  I'm so disappointed! ;(  It jumps from 'the fatherless the find there rest..."" line into the chorus and totally skips ""the sick are healed and the dead are raised...""  VERY DISAPPOINTING download... and no way for refund. :(
I hope you're reading the reviews first (unlike me)... Hope this stops someone else from making my mistake!!!",0
"This Song is Good I only heard this song once on Pandora and was like, I need to get this! And I did. No disappointments.",1
Good Music Good Music,1
God awful This is most definitely one of the most terrible things ever to be put upon this earth. It is so bad that they must have been trying to make it this bad.,0
Terrible. I definitely did not like this track. We tried practicing it before singing it at church and the music skipped a line in the song. It's not a good instrumental version of your great name. I lvoet his song but this version is bad.,0
"Glee version excellent When I bought the mp3 download, I had not heard the original. I like the Glee version better by far.",1
Five Stars German Gothic music PERFEKT,1
"Hauntingly Beautiful Acoustic Folk In their Church EP, Adam Levy and Amber Rubarth have crafted touching, melodic and hauntingly beautiful music. The two artists work well together and the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. These are great acoustic sounds.",1

"1970 Self-Produced LP By The Woolies - A 1967 One-Hit Wonder In the heyday of the so-called ""Garage Bands"" one emerged from Lansing, Michigan to make a minor dent on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March 1967 with a surprisingly good rendition of the Bo Diddley-penned (in 1956) Who Do You Love? Led by vocalist Stormy Rice, the other members were harpist/keyboardist ""Boogie"" Bob Baldori, guitarist Jeff Baldori, bassist Ron English and drummer Bee Metros, their first time on record was 1965's Black Crow Blues b/w Morning Dew as TTP-156 which quickly went nowhere.

Late in 1966 they got Dunhill/ABC sufficiently interested to release Who Do You Love? b/w Hey Girl as Dunhill/ABC 4052 and by the following March they had made their one minor mark on U.S. Pop single history. However, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b/w Love Words bombed as Dunhill/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped. Hits collectors can find a decent copy of their lone charting side in the CD Michigan Nuggets but I have never run across the B-side in any such compilation, so at the moment completist collectors will have to settle for a good vinyl source such the 45-rpm covered here.

Despite their lack of commercial success, the talents displayed by the band were recognized by no less than two R&R legends (and Hall of Fame inductees) Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and starting in 1967 they often appeared as the back-up band for both artists (in fact, Berry's 1970 album Back Home features their contributions). Sometime in 1968 Rice embarked upon a solo career with his replacement being multiple instrumentalist Zocko Groendahl.

In 1970 they released the album ""Basic Rock"" at Bob Baldori's Spirit Records containing: A1. Who Do You Love?; A2. Two Way Wishin'; A3. Let's Not Use Each Other; A4. Bye Bye Johnny; A5. San Francisco Bay Blues; A6. Hear The Music; B1. You're My Angel; B2. Back For More; B3. Vandegraff's Blues; B4. Truckin'; B5. Wish You Would. From the LP emerged the 1970 singles Vandergraf's Blues (or I Get A Charge Out Of You) b/w Vandergraf's Blahs as Spirit 0007 and Back For More b/w the non-LP side Super Ball - label number not clear. Two years later they compiled their second album, ""Live At Lizard's"" - recorded at Lizard's in East Lansing - containing: A1. Shake The Boogie (3:38); A2. Stormy Monday (4:38); A3. Berry Medley (6:42); A4. Mojo (9:14); B1. Dust My Blues (3:44); B2. I Wanna Boogie (9:10); B3. Hot Tamales (1:46); B4. Comin' Round The Mountain (1:39); B5. Bye Bye Boogie (10:00).

A CD collection of their music recorded from 1965 to 1975 has been produced by Bob Baldori titled Ride, Ride, Ride containing: 1. Super Ball (3.16); 2. Ride Ride Ride (3.06); 3. Black Crow Blues (1.41); 4. Love Words (2.47); 5. Bring It With You When You Come (1.57); 6. Morning Dew (2.45); 7. Chuck's Chunk (2.17); 8. Who Do You Love? (2.02); 9. Feelin' Good (3.01); 10. Can't Get Stuff (3.28); 11. Hootchie Cootchie Man Is Back (2.44); 12. Back for More (2.45); 13. Duncan And Brady (2.24); Vandegraf's Blues (2.54); 15. Two Way Wishin' (2.24); 16. Hyper-Inflation Boogie (1.57). Unfortunately, that does not appear to be available through Amazon.com.",1

"Very satisfying! This CD is absolutely amazing! The voice, the drums, the guitar, the key board..... I can't begin to say how great every song is. My personal favorite is Diver, the theme from Naruto Shippuden. Much to my enjoyment they are a very entertaining band just like Asian Kung Fu Generation and The Massmissile. I highly suggest this to fans of Jrock or Jpop. You will not be disappointed at all.",1
Two Stars Not what I expected,0
"It does sound like somebody ripped off melodies from Beethoven to write music in another style. Sure, there is a recognizable theme from the second movement of the Pathetique, and it explains another reviewer's reaction: ""who ripped this off Beethoven?""

In fact, that's the proper way to describe this make-believe 10th. Cooper took themes (mostly incomplete themes) belonging Beethoven, and he wrote a piece that's not in any recognizable Beethoven style. He wrote it in the style of Schumann, Mendelssohn and, mildly in places of counterpoint, Brahms.

It contains more melodies crammed together than Beethoven incorporates in his symphonies. The ketches used in this symphony were written during different times in Beethoven's life and they may well have been intended for uses other than a 10th symphony. They were pasted together with crazy glue.

Cooper's Symphony #10 is no more than a piece of conversation.

I doubt you'll want to listen to it more than 2 or 3 times, out of curiosity for cooper's understanding of Beethoven. Cooper may be a scholar who has studied how Beethoven wrote music. He may cognitively understand Beethoven's method of composition, but Beethoven has not penetrated his creative heart.",0
"Boring Sameness Songwriters they aren't.  Except for ""Storm Comin' "" every song is the same low-key drone with uninspired mumbled lyrics. Even ""Storm Comin' "" gets old fast since it is so repetitious.  A good song is more than a few good lines repeated ad nauseum.

I should have learned my lesson with ""Live at the Mauch Chunk Opera House"". Of the five songs I like on that CD, four are covers.  Songs written by the Jennys were forgettable.",0
Not Their Best By a Long Shot Despite a nice version of Bright Morning Star this CD was a huge disappointment.  The exquisite harmonies that are the magic of The Wailin Jenneys are absent from many of the selections.  The music is more orchestrated and far less traditional and/or acoustic.  Sadly this is what happens to so many acoustic and traditional musicians.  They try to appeal to a pop audience and forget who they are and what makes them unique & special.,0
"Very enjoyable, highly recommend! My first listen...LOVE THESE GALS! MUSIC AND VOICES....AND SPUNK!",1

I am a big fan of the Hans Zimmer and James Horner pieces but this album does NOT do their scores justice at all!!  I already have some songs from the movie originals and the ones on this album are TERRIBLE!!!! Hans Zimmer has done a wonderful job composing these songs but these songs are not movie originals and they aren't as ""full"" as the originals and the voices are not the same singers.
I've learned my lesson...next time I will do more research. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase! :'(",0

"Rap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei Of the many shelved Death Row-associated projects, this one represents probably the most regrettable what-if, how-much-of-a-classic-it-would-have-been-had-it-been-released-on-time, situation,

Rap groups tend to behave a bit like radioactive nuclei, i.e., they have a decay half-life. It's quite short and it's especially brief when they are put together sort of randomly and loosely as a promotion vehicle for their members, which was the case with the LBC Crew. This album was recorded around 1995, but it had to wait for Dogg Food to come out first, as Daz and Kurupt had already been introduced on previous Death Row releases and it was their turn to put out an album. But Dogg Food was delayed for legal reasons and only came out in late 1995, just when 2Pac came in and instantly became the massive star around which everything in the label gravitated. Meanwhile there were issues with how exactly the album was to be released. Bottom line, they were given enough time to fall out with each other, and they duly did it, right around the time when the label itself began falling apart too.

And the album never came out, which is real shame.

There are a couple forgettable tracks, but overall this is at least on the same level as Dogg Food, and it should have ranked right there with it and other Death Row releases in the pantheon of G-Funk classics. Unfortunately, at this point in time it's not really possible to appreciate how good the album is as after it got shelved, several of the tracks were reused for other projects and much of the rest leaked on the internet. So few people will be hearing all of it for the first time. And that's also a shame because the tracks that came out on other projects around 1997 ended up lost in the shuffle of the Death Row collapse -- for example, Out The Moon was on the Gridlock'd soundtrack, which went gold, but it nevertheless remains a relatively obscure track because no video was ever made for it and it was never given any serious promotion, Really sad.

Anyway, if you have never heard any of these tracks before, consider yourself lucky and listen to it as a new album from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.",1
"IF YOU LIKE LONG BEACH SOUNDS FROM THE MID 90's If you're down with sounds from the DEATH ROW era when Pac, Dre Snoop, Dogg Pound and
others were deeply on the map. You would enjoy this album, cauz this was supposed to
come out around 1996 and it was never released. You can hear Tray Dee from The Eassidaz
was part of the group as well as lil' C style. For all true West Coast fans. Enjoy.",1
Five Stars Good music.,1

"True To The Show, Sounds Great I was ecstatic to find this soundtrack after doing a google search for the instrumental theme song. I ordered a copy for both my sister and myself who have been fans of the show since it first aired when we were children. The CD is high sound quality and the artwork is great. We had a wonderful, sentimental time listening to all the tracks and remembering the episodes they belong to. It has a great nostalgic feel that really brings back a lot of the emotion of the show. I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to anyone who was a fan of The Young Riders. I am very pleased with this purchase.",1
"Not worth getting I was waiting for some of the moody, lonely music that was heard on Rat Patrol but haven't found it yet. It certainly isn't on this CD",0
"Several decent versions of the main theme, but missing all the major and memorable incidental music & secondary themes This CD contains several decent versions of the ""The Rat Patrol"" TV show theme (""The Rat Patrol Main Title,"" ""The Rat Patrol End Credits,"" and ""Theme From The Rat Patrol""), but is sorely lacking in all the other major and memorable secondary themes and music.  Amazing, considering there are 42 additional bits of music, the shortest at 49 seconds and the longest at more than 5 minutes, most all of them unrecognizable to fans of this classic late-'60's TV show, including myself -- and I've got both seasons of the show on DVD.

The CD is nicely packaged, with the insert booklet fronting a great photo of the show's four main cast members, and contains some interesting text about the making of the show and Dominic Frontiere's remarks on creating the soundtrack.  As with any re-recorded compilation of soundtrack music from a television show performed by  musicians other than the originals (in this case the Graunke Symphony Orchestra, although per the CD's text notes, supposedly conducted by Frontiere), the main theme pieces I mentioned above sound just a tad different from the music on the TV episodes.

Overall, a disappointment, due to the inexplicable omission of some memorable secondary themes and music from the show.  I'm glad I got a used copy, and didn't pay too much  for this item.",0
"Rat Patrol CD This is an excellent quality CD with the original theme and background music I remember from the 'Rat Patrol' series.  It's quite similar to the 3 CD set of Dominic Frontiere's music from 'The Outer Limits', and I hope there will soon be a release of his original scores from '12 O'Clock High'.",1
"... four out of five stars not because it isn't good, but because I was hoping Verishuvi & Please I gave it four out of five stars not because it isn't good, but because I was hoping Verishuvi & Please, Please, Please were on 2010.  Since purchasing I figured out they are on 2011 and have ordered it.  In context, Doki Doki Morning seems out of place with the rest of the Album, but I'm one of those that wouldn't have ever purchased this if it hadn't been for Babymetal.

"Grating on the Nerves This recording is clearly amateur and the poor quality of the performance makes it difficult to listen to.  There's a blatant mistake at 2:59, as well as numerous iffy parts overall, and there's absolutely no artistic effort made here.  Essentially it sounds like a piano student muddling along to a metronome.  I would stick to a real recording by Horowitz or Gould.",0

"Nice!! Nicely done, in my opinion not nearly long enough! This is a great album. TSO is what ROCK OPERA is all about.  You have to like rock & roll to appreciate this album.

"Headphone Commute Review Gareth Davis and Rutger Zuydervelt have first met around 2009, when the duo recorded their first piece, Soundlines. After the limited edition EP was self-released by Machinefabriek, the duo didn't waste any time, and put out another 3 CDr, titled Ghost Lanes [which later got picked up by Dekorder with an additional track]. A year later, Davis and Zuydervelt got together again, this time for an album for Home Normal, titled Drape. And now the two appear on Sonic Pieces, with a two-part, Grower. Those familiar with Davis, can instantly imagine the brooding darkness this clarinetist can contribute to Zuydervelt's shuffling treatments. At times barely audible, woodwind breathes over low rumbling drones, creating a stilled atmosphere where even a pin drop gets picked up by the mic. The tender poise of each wave is slowly cultivated through a unique language among the two musicians, allowing the sound to unfold on its own, in environment free of grievance.  Focusing on the music, or just letting it seep, is something a mind must decide on its own. In either case, the meditative piece will reward those with patience. No wonder Grower was featured on Headphone Commute's Best of 2011, Music For Sonic Installations In the Cavern Of Your Skull. Be sure to also check out my review of Gareth Davis & Frances-Marie Uitti Gramercy, out on Miasmah. I'm sure we'll hear from the two again...",1
"A fun piece of jazz to create the right atmosphere at night. I stumbled onto this piece of improvisational jazz by accident.  Approximately 10 minutes in length and without any recognizable melody,  the piano, bass and percussion skillfully interact with each other in a  way that makes one wonder how it will end.  My reaction: wow!  A great night mood mix.",1

Five Stars Always been a favorite song,1
"I really wanted to like it.... I really tried to be open while listening to this album, but it saddens me to say the least. I used to watch these guys play with Skif Dank all the time in a downtown local pub, and that's when they rocked. The horn parts are few, and this new synth stuff they're putting in there really make them sound like a different band.

I understand bands have to switch their style up, but they are hardly anything like The Supervillains. I don't know what happened to the actual band, but this is nothing like the last album.

Some people will be able to relate when I say that this album makes me feel dirty, and depressed. If thats your style, and something you think you'd enjoy then by all means definitely get this album. If you were expecting a Supervillains album, then look for a new band, or I guess you could listen to these guys.

Wow, what a shame....

Law Records has some other bands worth mentioning though. Such as, Passafire, Iration, and of course Pepper. Law Records also just signed Bally Hoo, and they are awesome.",0

"Pornographic and Glorification of Drug Use After listening to a lot of samples of house, dance, and club music mixed for continuous workout, and after reading the two 5-star reviews, I was optimistic that this would be just what I was looking for. For me, the whole point of workout music is finding something that you can listen to repeatedly and not get annoyed or offended by today's crappy oversexed lyrics. This album does offer over an hour of non-stop workout music, but about 3/4 of the way through, I was assaulted by a pornographic track, where a woman invites her lover to ""run your fingers through my hair, everywhere, everywhere...if you dare."" That would be tolerable, if it stopped there. But later, she repeats, ""put your finger in my AH!"" and then ""put one finger in my AH! put two fingers in my OH! put three fingers in my UH! and one more in my OH!"" I wish I were making this up, people. Trash, trash trash. I only write this review to spare someone the offense. I was in the middle of my workout, and you can't advance tracks since it is continuous, so I suffered through it for the next song... Only to be further disappointed that some techno rapper DJ dude proceeded to glorify smoking weed, getting high, passing out, and getting arrested. It seemed to allude to hard core drugs as well. Come on, people! Nothing else to live for? Don't put it on a workout track for healthy human beings, that's for darn sure! It's dirt cheap--because it's dirt. Aside from these examples, the rest of the music was a mixed bag. Not a lot of creativity going on here, and some of the sounds (""instrumentation"") really shrill and annoying. Caveat Emptor!",0

"Definitely ""the musical journey of a lifetime""! Aaja captures the essence of Asia with a contemporary feel - a phenomenal fusion of cultures! Tabla, flute, guitar and piano, all flawlessly orchestrated to accompany Navin's awe inspiring vocals. Attaining levels and an intensity that he hasn't attempted in his previous songs, not only the pitch, but the power, range and variations perfectly blend from one into the other.

From the slow soulful alaaps to the rapidly controlled sargam, one cannot help being left emotionally spent in a pleasing way when the final note fades into the distance. I can't imagine anyone not wanting their loved one to profess their affection in such exquisite style.

Loving it to the extreme!",1

"Illegal, and will bring suit-actually the government will for defrauding them. With the discovery of the recording of the 1942-1945 OTHELLO, by Paul Robeson, the numbers of the albums prove that this recording was not only from 1939, but that it was during the ""Playwrites Company"". A witness saw the production at Jones Beach Theatre.

The partners of Amazon.com have totally falsified the recording of the tour of the 1938 Stadium Concert of Show Boat. In fact it means that this is the FIRST time that ""YOU ARE LOVE"" was written and THAT is the reason that there have been so many lies about the production. Even the EMI collection cited below, I have checked. The 1939 recordings were done in AMERICA, but EMI can transfer as they see fit. HOWEVER, one done in ENGLAND still has a different appearance than one transferred to ENGLAND. Before speaking of why I was buying the records I obtained them. They were from America.

In order to try to fake this as 1946, and long, long after anyone could remember, the BLUE SEAL, or government albums were secretly transferred out of America. Records BEFORE these, and AFTER these were combined into ONE, something Columbia never does, and it was claimed that they were from 1942 and 1945. Well, now that I have Othello, which covers that period, I am going to the National Archives and correcting this, and claiming the rights to the blue seal records that MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME. In Addition, everyone should know, that one was allowed AD-on's in those days. The person who sang the immediate record added to this was EZIO PINZA, singing the Robison Spirituals that had been used in the original Ziegfeld Show Boat.

Mr. Robison came to AMERICA in early to spring 1938. He brought with him a recording from the Polish Resistence Army, of artists who were in the Jewish Ghettos. Robison had been there. This album is and they were supposed to be part of his recordings of Songs of Free Men. I had thought them lost, but they are now real and in my possession, just as directed by Joseph Toner, who told me of them. Joseph Toner wrote Polinaise, out of the great respect for Mr. Robison who had gone to the Jewish Ghetto's and come out of them with his own song, in the songs of Free Men, missing the songs OF THOSE MEN. Polinaise was produced in 1945 and sung by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, but only the original test production was ever released, the first time the name of Wrightson was used, and no person yet found to fit the face.

Mr. Robeson, he was able to perform in Othello in 1943 to rave reviews. He also sang a piece by JOHN LATOUCHE about FREEDOM in AMERICA, and was outspoken in his opinions as to how persons of color were then being treated in the US. That was originally Columbia C-49 the Ballad for Americans, Feb. 9 1940. The so called 1932 reconstruction was C-55, approx 1943, and Mr. Robison had only to sing one piece, the rest could be done alone. It was to falsify that the song YOU ARE LOVE had existed. But nobody knew the devious intentions of Mr. Hammerstein. Mr. Melton certainly did. AKA Jimmy Carroll.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Boat-1932-Studio-Cast/dp/B000002Y1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Boat (1932 Studio Cast)</a>

 Ah, a new pseudonym for Joseph Toner, RICHARD TORIGI. There were other TORIGI's such as in My Fair Lady, and some very funny singing others I call the ""lounge lizard"" Torigi but I can only have 10 links so watch out for that.

It took them a long time to get the ""Strativari Strings"" rights. It was the 1943 production by the Met and Kostelanetz. We found the original.

So who sang in 1946?

Everyone was told it was the Met Opera Star Brian Sullivan, whom, after Bernstein left the Met, was tossed out by Richard Rodgers. He killed himself in Geneva, a totally forgotten man.

NYTimes, June 10 1969,""Brian Sullivan, Tenor, 49 is Dead"". NOTE: ""At one point he rehearsed in Italian in 12 days the part of Count Almaviva in Rossini's Barber of Seville: in order to appear with John Charles Thomas ""The Figaro"".

Brian Sullivan was with the MET from 1948-1964. When did Rodgers take control of the met? 1965.

""After the war he (Brian Sullivan) appeared as Gaylord Ravenal in Show Boat, and later in Street Sceen opening on Jan 9th 1947.""

Well, you all get the picture huh?

It was John Charles Thomas, IE JOSEPH TONER, who Victor claims in 1932 sang OLD MAN RIVER, BUT a different version was put on the radio in 1926, now on YouTube. We have almost completed the reconstruction of the original 1926 Show Boat. An outside expert puts the date of the 1000 series of John Charles Thomas at 1912. But recently even those that stole this rightfully copywritten american work say it is 1910. JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, the MAJOR OPERA star never appears on any historic Show Boat album by Victor.

This would make JOHN CHARLES THOMAS THE only man to have sung the piece on this side of the Atlantic, not to mention that it was not written by Hammerstein II! This is good reason to supress a person.

Ziegfeld would roll over in his grave.

Recall what SHOW BOAT was all about, civil rights: equality, tolerance, the trouble that came from a two class society, alcoholism, gambling addiction, abandonment, the terrible plight of people of color and prejudice--I cannot give, even JOSEPH TONER AND PAUL ROBESON SINGING SIDE BY SIDE, more than one star for a product that continues what Ziegfeld was trying to END.

EMI put out products that tell part of Robison's story. and definitavely document that he was not in the 1932 Show Boat. One is the EMI Sessions: The Complete EMI Sessions, 1928-1939 [Box Set] Joseph Toner and Robeson both had to sing SHOW BOAT AGAIN to let Robeson go home on the following: Showboat (Stereo LP)Show Boat I await the Shubert/Williamson Corp.

"Has narrator reading a disclosure at the beginning AND the end While the sounds are amazing, I have one REALLY big gripe that should be a huge deal breaker for most people.

HERE'S MY DEAL BREAKER:
About five seconds in, a narrator comes on to read a disclosure.  It goes like this: ""Warning, this session includes audible hypnotic suggestions, subliminal messages and binaural beats.  It should not be used in a moving vehicle or any other time when you need to be fully awake and alert.""  Then about one minute before it ends you hear yet another disclosure:  ""Warning, this session is about to end.  Please give yourself a few minutes to become completely alert before resuming normal activity.""  And god forbid if you have these on repeat.

I use these for sleep, naps, while at work, and when studying.  Essentially, it's ambient sounds to drown out any other, distracting, sounds.  Extremely annoying and very distracting.  Imagine being completely relaxed, you're feeling good; daydreaming even.  Then, you're immediately jerked back to reality with this disclosure.

There are many, many other titles that DO NOT contain these annoying messages.",0

"we can't all be Jon Boden and toss off a brilliant rendition of a folk song at the drop of ... Boden's ""Folk Song A Day"" project is wonderful--the purpose supposedly is to encourage social singing, to make you confident enough to sing yourself, but never mind that, we can't all be Jon Boden and toss off a brilliant rendition of a folk song at the drop of a hat. What you have here is an amazing amount of folk music for a cheap price--you can listen for free over at the ""Folk Song A Day"" website, but Boden should be encouraged with cash on the barrelhead--where the 365 songs total in the twelve monthly albums is some enormous part of the British folksong tradition. The heart of his endeavor is traditional English folksong, but he has healthy amounts of Irish and Scottish folksong, modern songs (folk, pop, musicals, humorous, etc.), and a fair dollop of songs composed by and/or sung by Boden's idol, Peter Bellamy. A fair sprinkling of the songs sung in the ""Folk Song A Day"" project appear later in Boden's solo or joint albums--he was trying them out here first, I think. Boden's great strength is interpretation--he makes you listen to the songs' words and think about what they mean, makes coherent stories out of them. To that he adds a fine voice--better than Bellamy's, for a not so random example. I cannot recommend these highly enough.

In this month I am particularly fond of ""Tyne of Harrow"", ""Cruel Mother"" and ""Child Morris"".",1

  If you aren't familiar with Red Dirt music, this is a great introduction. It is somewhere between Western Swing, Country & Western, Bluegrass and Southern Rock. Where, exactly, I have no idea. I just know it has a brand of smooth and easy that I find enjoyable. If you like any of the above or even patriotic music, I can't see why you shouldn't love this one.

"An Excellent First Work Angela and Aubrey, aka The Doubleclicks, are clearly clever and gifted musicians.  What they're developing, starting here, is the voice -- the unique auditory and perspective that clearly defines who they are -- that makes other musical acts so successful.

Sara Quin doesn't sing in a high note for it.  My favorite is ""Humdrum Town"" though.  My niece was helping me search for some cell phone ring tones when I came across ""Humdrum Town.""  It's not on this album though.  The beat sounds like it's in the Trance genre.  The rhythm is choppy which keeps it fresh.

The song has swirling keyboards and heavy echo that sounds like a tribute band trying to come up with some original River era music of their own.  Mr. Carey's vocals show why he was hired to be a keyboardist for Rainbow.  The song is saved by the fact he does do a pretty decent job of clipping a Springsteen style sound.

"Favorite featuring Luka This song has become my favorite out of my Luka library. It's a must have for any fan, or anyone interested in its type.

Also keep in mind that it's in japanese. Here are the english lyrics though.

-----

I tripped and fell, and laughed after hiding the sky I was drawing
I bowed my head and while pretending to be oblivious, stood under the umbrella alone

The future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something
Everytime I cling, I become dyed in black

Solve it and don't touch me, even when I'm dyed in sadness
The color of you hand that I grabbed while laughing
Is forgotten - The day I close my eyes
The colorful world will surely turn into black and white

I repeat ""goodbye"" and traced ""see you again""
I decided to cry.
Saying since bowing my head hurts, that I don't need warmth

The future feels like it's about to disappear everytime I wish for something
Everytime I cling, I'm painted in white

If, if in the hollow world,
I can live only by embracing
Your fading sound that echoes and smears
Do I need any other songs?

In the touch that I longed for,
The color blue was hurt and buried
I reach out my hand and cut off the connection
Until everything rots away

Even when I touch, connect, and dye in sadness,
Our hands echo and smear
The world that I drew while embracing and overlapping
Paints me in vivid colors countless times",1
Wow Great version of this wonderful song.  Our choir sang it recently and I was thrilled to find this version on Amazon so I can listen to it often.,1
"Incursion and Rebuff I was walking around the other day, as happy as Larry, when a memento mori came to mind. At first I could not place it. Hours later, it came to me: it was the development, for lack of a better word, in the first movement of Moments Musicaux. Fearsome in the reaping, it brought the nihilism of the Tempest to mind:

""Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air:  And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,  the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve and, like this insubstantial pageant faded,  leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.""

What then, of castles in the air?

I normally avoid D 780  and the first two movements in particular  like Red Spot-itis. Theyre scarier, IMO, than Death and the Maiden or Winterreise. Is it not amazing that Schubert could be so brave, with so little happiness in the bank and beleaguered by dissolution as he was? Think too, that somehow or other melody parries darkness in a sphere beyond the temporal. On this occasion, I thought it best to heed the omen so I sought out a new recording. Aunty Mitsuko came into frame and went just as quickly. It was news to me that Gilels had recorded it  he was a tad too fast for my liking. I don't know who Shino Moroto is. I daresay shell attract the attention of the worst elements of the Australian Knappertsbusch Association - animals one and all! In any event, this lass can play. Imagination, touch, depth of tone and ease with the space between notes  she has it all. Moroto is also cognisant that Schuberts piano-works are more penses than fodder for the concert hall: intimacy is always apparent. Insofar as one can enjoy D 780, she delivers the goods. Unblinkingly, the anguish and desolation of MM 1 & 2 are vented. She could possibly go harder in MM 5. Moroto also guns D 899. Just listen to her in the famous G-Flat Impromptus: one could float away in the breeze! Thats perfection!

Recording-wise, this is phenomenal. As she weaves her magic, all one say is ""Bravo Shino!""",1

"Same old Tony Robbins Tony Robbins is an expert on saying the same things over and over and over and over again but repackaging them differently so it seems like its a different message each time.  He has been shouting and touting the same old messages for almost 20 years and these CD's say nothing different that I haven't heard him say anywhere else or on youtube videos for that matter.

I am just soooo glad I have never been coerced by temptation to attend his seminars and literally pay thousands of dollars for attending. Or even to pay several hundreds of dollars for his CDs. I found this set for next to nothing on ebay. I feel sorry for the countless thousands who have emptied their pockets to bulge Tony Robbin's while they have been mesmerized by hollow Pied Piper tunes to the lure of ""come follow me and I will lead you to ga ga dreamland "".  In my opinion Tony Robbins borders on being a fraudulent crook and a sham.",0

Four Stars good song,1
"Cool old song Cool old song. HOWEVER, I think this is a remixed or re-recorded version. It doesn't seem to have the same punch as the radio versus I hear every once in a while.",0
"good but lacks the same gusto as the original this is a redub, Jay re-recorded about 40 years later, good but lacks the same gusto as the original.",0
"What a bad song. This song is bad for so many reasons. Here are these reasons:
1. Justin Bieber doesn't have the proper voice for this song. His voice is too high pitched and childlike.
2. The song is unoriginal and predictable. Nothing special about it. Just a typical teen love song.
3. The lyrics are poorly written, boring and repetitive.
4. The music does not fit the song. It's too techno for a love song.
In my opinion, this is Justin Bieber's worst song ever. He never should of sang it.",0
Five Stars For the nephew,1
"What didn't I listen to the clips?!?!?!?! In simple words, this album is a misconception!!  All but one or two are obviously NOT the originals.  Even at $6.99, this is a ripoff because we the consumer are misled into thinking we're getting originals.  Beware!!!",0
"This is Great Music...... minds eye pop rock. If you like gorillaz, you will enjoy this, pretty artsy though. I like that.

its like listening to a modern day coppola movie.",1
Sell out. The second half is obviously not the original recordings. Arrangements are different and so is the tonal quality as well as instrumentation. But what do you expect; it's K-tel records. Its like Eric is a sellout. Very disappointing.,0
A Sucky Remake Album A really sucky remake album... not the originals... I highly recommend not to purchase this album nor any of the ones Amazon sells as Digital media.,0
What a disappointment. I had hoped these would be the original recordings and they are not.  What a disappointment.,0
Wasnt what I thought I should have listened to all the songs. This is a remastered piece of work with a different arrangement than the originals. I don't like them as well.,0
Beware this is not the original recording I bought this expecting the original 1960's recording but this is much later and with different arrangements to suit Eric's withered voice.,0
... not buy this the condition was supposed to be good. There were scratches on the cd do not buy this the condition was supposed to be good.,0
Two Stars Case was cracked but cd worked good,0
Not The Original Recordings This collection is not the original released recordings.  They are either re-recorded by the original lead vocalists or a flat knock-off imitation.  Find another series if you're trying to find original versions.,0

"it did not sound like the Animals version at all Chose ""Spill the Wine"" by the Animals and when I played it, it did not sound like the Animals version at all. Right song - wrong group. Bummer....",0

"All Re-Records!! Terrible collection!! Except for ""Be Thankful For What You've Got"", all the other songs are re-records, meaning they are NOT the original radio versions.

One Star Bought by mistake. Thought it was a video instead of audio.,0
"Don't Buy, seriously Now I know why it was so hard to find: it is terrible. For the most part, it is remixes (for lack of a better word) of classic pre- Island Records' Wialers' tunes, done in 80's electronic style. Honestly, it is tough to even tell it is reggae. It is very poor sound quality as well. Don't buy. My seller was great, it is the product that's the issue.",0
Not a superstitious or easily scared person but had a creepy experience twice after ... Ok. Not a superstitious or easily scared person but had a creepy experience twice after falling  asleep to this. Won't go into detail but beyond scary. Just know that binaural beats split your mind open and vulnerable. Watch out!,0
"Can't use it for sleeping. Track starts with a ""Warning"". So it is not suitable for trying to sleep with it on repeat as the ""Warning"" wakes me up.",0
"Wakes me up with loud voice at the end What is the point of this? I have tried it a few times. Doesn't actually help me sleep at all, but even if it did it's no good as far as I'm concerned. Near the end of the track a loud voice starts to announce that you are coming to the end of the program. I've never heard the rest because I am jolted awake and quickly trying to turn it off. I've been at least calmer at the point and then once I hear the voice, very awake and frustrated.",0
"Does not produce delta wave sleep for me. I've been monitoring my sleep with a Zeo sleep monitor system that measures your actual brainwave patterns while sleeping.  Unaided, I typically get 5-20 minutes of delta wave (aka deep sleep) sleep.  I removed the two vocal warnings at the beginning and ending of this and used it on auto-repeat with headphones last night.  My Zeo measured a whopping 13 mins of delta wave sleep; no statistical improvement over unaided sleep for me.

I'm a believer in the effectiveness of binaural beats and therefore disappointed that so many of these MP3s like this don't produce results.  I suspect the process of making an audio track into an MP3 actually destroys the binaural beats (MP3 conversion strips out frequencies the converter thinks you won't notice as missing as part of the compression scheme); however, if you listen carefully I think you can hear the tones behind the water noises.  Perhaps the CD version of this would work better.

The water sounds aren't unpleasant, and they seem to be fairly consistent in volume, so I gave an extra star, but in the end, if you advertise as a product that produces deep sleep and you don't, I can't recommend it.",0

"Another One-Hit Wonder But With A Wide Array Of Impressive Work Born in New York City in 1917, orchestra arranger/conductor Robert ""Bob"" Mersey began his long career in the late 1930s with the Big Bands of Abe Lyman and Woody Herman before joining NBC radio after WW II as their staff arranger. Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby's Blues/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.

He then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy's hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy's Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January/February 1960 b/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a perfect fit for those listings.

That success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From ""I Am A Camera"" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy's Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What's It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From ""My Three Sons""/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn't chart either).

In 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - ""Det Moore & His Orchestra."" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.

I'm surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector's Choice hasn't yet remastered both albums for CD format. If they do, one would hope they'd include those non-album sides mentioned as ""bonus"" tracks. If all you want is Tracy's Theme an excellent copy can be found in Eric Records wonderful volume Hard To Find Orchestral Instrumentals.",1
"Love Jada's dance tunes...and now I love this midtempo song even better! I have all the Jada dance and pop songs from the years. And now I hear they can sing midtempo/r&b as well...and they sing it extremely well! This is such a nice song to listen to the lyrics to as it describes situations we all have been in through life. Once again with all the Jada songs, I can hear their soulful voices in every word they song, and the music and beat compliment them very well. I love how their music compliments their amazing singing ability, and not the other way around like the majority of pop/r&b artists. A+++ to Break Up Song :)",1
"I was left wanting I was looking for wedding songs and downloaded this after listening to the sample. The song itself does not go into much more depth than what is given in the sample. I had hoped that there would be a lot more to the lyrics than a repetition of you're the one, which extended beyond the chorus line into the verses. If you are searching for a song which conveys a depth of love, this is not the song for you. I""m in Love with You on the Prepare the Way album has more depth, and is of a similar tempo; or Golden by Chrisette Michelle.",0
"Do Not Buy This Track Please do not buy this song. I am using this song in my wedding Sunday, and it is not the right track. When I played it, it is a totally different song.

"infectious multi-taskers . . . Hailing from upstate NY, the Spring Standards wowed a small crowd this summer (2010) at a WXPN-sponsored show in Haddon Lake Park in South Jersey.  Except for an occasional assist by the band's manager on second guitar, the band was a self-contained trio of multi-taskers.  Heather Robb, James Cleave and James Smith sang lead and harmony and simultaneously covered either bass and bass drum, acoustic guitar and high-hat, or piano/organ and snare/tom.  The drum parts were lockstep - you'd have sworn there was a drummer hidden behind a speaker column.  All but track two (due to language) made it to the live show.  So what does the disc sound like?  Pretty much the same as the infectious live show.  Scattershot blues (""Here I Am"").  Cabaret piano (""Queen of the Lot"").  Scrappy Appalachian backbeats (""The Hush"").  Fingerstyle ballads (""Frozen"").  Decemberists-style rock (""Not Again"").  And lots of layered vocals in unusually close harmonies (""Skyline,"" ""Bells and Whistles,"" ""Trouble"").  If you crossed Paul Simon, Lady Antebellum, and the Pretenders, would things be different?  It's likely -- the Spring Standards have set a new one.",1
"One Star Very disappointed, this track was supposed to be silent. It is NOT. Grrr",0
"A View to the Past with Global Glasses A brief story: When I heard the track Mercedes Benz (Janice Joplin's amusing ditty) on a local jazz station, I was transported back in time and place. It was my first exposure to Nguyn L's guitar, which can mimic the Vietnamese zither, the dan tranh. Suddenly, it was the late 1960's and the Vietnam War was a clear and present danger. Moreover, the interlude suggested the Grateful Dead's soundtrack to Apocalypse Now. This album covers tunes of my youth, and although they are not as powerful in effect as the mentioned track, and are somewhat uneven in arrangement with undistinguished vocals, they are fun to hear with their modern and global intepretation, with flavors of India, Vietnam, and the Middle East. L is mainly a jazz musician but this album is more rock in style, and it suffers by it. [How can I put aside the deeply etched original Beatles, Joplin, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley issues? A pure instrumental album would have been better.] L has over a dozen other musicians and vocalists involved in this 70-minute long album. The album is probably L's venture into the popular market, and I hope that the cross-over is just a visit. For his truly world jazz album, see Saiyuki.",1

dre made everybody wait 10 years for this I was a huge nwa fan and to hear how dre has fallen when he released this was a crying shame yes dre you need your head examined making these wack azz tecxhno beats and eminem don't help either he should have kept this track for himself ans I think skylar grey's a bad singer she fits in with this techno crap's that's coming out. sorry doc if detox sounds like this I'm not buying.,0
"It feels good!!! Cam did it again! From start to finish i enjoyed it so much! I caught myself nodding my head in amazement of how he challenges the listener to bold and he touces on topics that alot of people won't even get clost to.

"Doctor, Doctor??? There is no question that Dr. Dre had been absent from the music scene for a very long time. It feels like the world had really passed by in his absence. The last time he was heard was in 2001 with his sequel to The Chronic. Yet, he has awaited a long time to come out with something new. With rap fans eagerly anxious over his Detox release, he has shown his age, and his loss with I Need A Doctor, the lead single from that album. The song really isn't very strong in his collaboration with Enimem, and instead lets Eminem take the spotlight over him. I really felt that they did lose a lot of chemistry. He really did let the rhymes slide. I think Dr. Dre really does need a doctor right now. Hopefully, he'll get better with Detox coming out, if it does come alive soon.

I admit there some nice orchestration here and there but every piece is a protest song or some kind of social comment. I want music to move me, not to lecture me. This album is so dense that I don't feel the salsa vibe it needs. Salsa music is about fun, dance, etc. I really missed his flavor on earlier albums like ""Siembra"" and such. Even those albums contained some social content but they were very enjoyable.",0

"My least favorite of the two Fiery Works EPs. It's hard to rate a AGBPOL album as mediocre, but The Fiery Works EPs are just that. The song writing is just standard pop rock, which isn't necessarily bad, but just nothing incredible. To see how much they've grown into their own unique sound with Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex? and their best effort so far, You're Always On My Mind. When compared to those two, it's just mediocre albums. The sound isn't that tight and the vocals are really raw. The Fiery Works II is probably my least favorite of the two. The songs aren't as good as the previous one, in my opinion. If you're new to the band, skip these for now, but if you've listened to the new albums and you've become a fan, then it's nice to check these out and see how much they've grown.",0

"complaint My review has nothing to do with the music, but rather with the system Amazon uses to download music.  I was not able to  purchase  this item because it wouldn't  download.  I called and got assistance from Amazon, but it still wouldn't download.  I don't know why Amazon changed the system it  had before which made downloading simple, but the present system (since the advent of that Cloud thing) is terrible.  I am sorry not to be able to download any more music as I can't get through the awful  system.

This version was a shortened, yet *enhanced* variation of the ""Club Attack Mix.""  However,  this version sounded MUCH better than both the Club Attack Mix and Space Invaders mix, which were released to the public.

"The Hard Rain of Maximiano Cobra Reader, all things in the universe are subject to a bell-curve. Maximiano Cobra is no exception. Even so, to say that he's an outlier is specious. He's at the very first atom of the rim of the bell as it tapers away into the nothingness.

Strange to say, Cobra has one signal triumph to his name. It's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Orchestral-Music-Album-4/dp/B0001LNTCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner-Orchestral Music Album 4</a>. I would have thought that Bruckner could have survived his onslaught and indeed, flourished in doing so given that his time-space continuum does not differ greatly from the Master of Bayreuth. How wrong I was.

This is eternity, Jim, but not as we know it.

Consider, if you dare, the timings of his Bruckner Ninth: 47'21"" for the first movement, followed by 18'35"" for the Scherzo and a mind-shredding, soul-destroying 39'08"" for the finale. It's an invitation to go mad or befriend the Kardashians. The subtext was clear: there is no god. In desperation, I rang Hell's hotline in the hope of selling my soul to the Devil for a few shillings. It too, was unmanned. We are alone - alone with the Cobra!

I agree with Klaus Heid. Either this orchestra is computer-generated or Tempus reused the DG's recording equipment from Karajan's 1980 performance of the Alpine Symphony.

"Yuk, Bleah, don't buy The singing is uninspiring.  Often the melody is overpowered by the harmony, the singing is clipped and abrupt.  The vibratos of the singers does not allow the chords to tune and ""lock"" in.  I have no idea why the occasional ""whump"" of a bass drum is present.  The christmas songs now have a ""caveman"" feel because of the drum.  Phooeee.  The tempos are too fast and don't give the listener a chance to appreciate the music.

"Best real rockers I've heard Once again, Hogjaw has made some seriously good stuff with Ironwood. The only problem I've been having with Hogjaw is I have not been listening to any of the other 8000 songs from artists of all music genres in my iPod. Like many people, I have wide musical tastes, but Hogjaw's stuff is very addictive. You know when you get hooked on a really really good song, and you can't stop playing it a lot every day, then when it wears out, it wears out? After it wears out, you can't listen to it for some time. Well, with Hogjaw, they have around 15 songs that are lasting way past anything I've experienced in the past and I see no end to jamming them everywhere I go. I also can't really find anything else out there that sounds like them. This is the good stuff man...really good.",1
"Hogjaw - Ironwood (CD - 2010) The powerful new album ! The Ironwood is an extraordinary plant that lives in the Arizona desert in extreme climatic and environmental conditions, a towering plant capable of living up to 1500 years, thus a symbol of unmatched tenacity and power, that we find in Hogjaw's brand new CD, titled Ironwood, from Phoenix (Ariz) and of which I spoke at their debut in 2008.

With their debut album, Devil in the Details they already made it clear what they were made of, but with this new CD they stormed by force in the Olympus of the renovated and seething Southern Rock movement.

Immediately at first hearing the charge and bullying style of the band strikes hard, with incisive and powerful guitars of Craig Self and Jonboat Jones and melancholy voice and biting of the same Jones, combined with the incessant rhythm of Kwall's drums and Elvis DD on bass, with whom I had a pleasant exchange of emails and I learned him to be of Italian origin as well as a Gulf War veteran.

As soon as Rollin' Thunder opens you cannot fail to turn up the volume, its charge is a perfect and overwhelming starter to the subsequent Backtop and Three Fifty Seven, which has absolutely breathtaking riffs and scorching solos.

We find a little pause around the fifth track, County Line with typical old southern melodies and a long and beautiful final solo with an atmosphere reminiscent of the Skynyrd sound, and then resume to the initial power with Ain't ever gonna win until the final Hornsnowgglin that brings us back with our feet on the ground, throwing us in the deep south made of slide guitars and whiskey burnt voices.

A CD that is a real shot of adrenaline with really inspired songs, powerful riffs and fiery solos, but at the same time takes us away in the deep and dusty southwest rediscovering the old melodies of 70' Southern Rock, enriched with a powerful and aggressive sound I like to call Heavy Southern Rock.

A CD not to miss in your Southern record library, but I am convinced that lovers of good music and of the most powerful rock will like this too, a job which I believe is already among the best Southern Rock albums of this 2010.",1

I believe one of my albums he handles the whole album as far as mixing and editing, giving feedback. Radio Friendly is his best work by far. I hope you all buy and LOVE the album!

As another reviewer noted, it is indeed highly repetitive, but, then, so is a great deal of so-called ""new age"" music (think of Vangelis, for example).  The CD is to be chosen for the quality of its ambiance more than its musical innovation, to be sure.  I am musically disappointed in the fade-out more than the repetition, as this music might easily have come to clean cadences.",1

Because there are so many songs in existence, the words are the least important because very few songs have any profound or interesting or amusing statements to make.  He ruins his otherwise slightly above average instrumentation, and provides only a small amount of decent guitar sounds.  First off, he needs to find a singer that can sing and then create some music that is much better than boring.",0
"Not what I expected Two major problems for an English speaker trying to learn French:
1.  The phrases are said in French first and then in English and not repeated, so when listening, you have no idea what they are saying in French until after it is said, and then you have no chance to practice saying it.
2.  Because of the speed at which the words are said, I expected to be able to download and print a script that would allow me to follow along.  I first purchased the mp3 album on my phone so that I can practice anytime.  Now that I have logged on to my amazon site, I see that there is no downloadable script.

"Nothing Short of Awesome! Urban Myth Club's second release, I'm relieved to say, is most certainly not a letdown!

The songs are fresh yet the quality of the first album (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helium/dp/B000EFTENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helium</a>) is preserved, and, dare I say, surpassed!?
The virtual worlds these songs create are richer, more alive than the previous go-around, but each track is just as engaging as Helium's were, and have just as much staying power, if not more. Put one of these songs on repeat for as long as you want, you won't be playing these tunes out any time soon! ;)

I say play this album in the background while spending some quality time with your lover...this one sets a particular mood. *wink, wink*

I'm a bigger fan of the 1st half of this album than the second. For some reason, I find that the 1st set of tracks seem to be catchier and more memorable than the rest. None of the songs are ""bad"" but let's just say I wouldn't be able to identify the title of a track from the second half of the album, if I was given only the first few seconds to listen to. They're still good, but they just never ""stuck"".

My lineup of favorites are as follows (in chronological order):

1 - Wake Up
2 - Surrender
3 - Don't Need To Say It
4 - Everything's All Right
5 - Coming Home
7 - We Have Landed

Of these, We Have Landed is the most provocative. It's a haunting, brooding track that stays with you for a while after hearing it.
Creepy and sad in all the best ways. I can see this being the opening title track to another James Bond adventure flick. Nice counterpart to So Beautiful.

I would describe Coming Home as a sort of ""sequel"" to Helium's Calling. Likewise, Everything's All Right seems like Open Up's answer to Spacewalk from Helium. That's not to say these are just different arrangements of the same songs. Not at all! They just have a similar kind of tone & tempo...set a similar mood. Another reviewer, writing about the Helium album, PERFECTLY stated how I feel about Everything's All Right when they said it's ""Great to play in the morning when you're just getting into the grind."" [K. Bowden]

Woke up with a hangover? Throw on that Wake Up track (on low volume, of course). You'll laugh your butt off! (Or you would if it didn't hurt so much to laugh) The guy's voice asserting ""It's a wonderful day!"" - you'll be rolling your eyes thinking ""Yeah ----ing right!!"" XD -- Good stuff!

Surrender is slightly more up-tempo than most of the other songs, with a couple exceptions (more on that later), and is a JOY to listen to!
The girl's voice is so PERFECT! I would compare it to The Cardigans' lead in My Favorite Game. Maybe even Ellie Goulding.
Either way, her voice just has a great tone to it. Hard to describe, but sort of...smoky?...dollish? Anyway, it's awesome! (EDIT: I just realized Bjork's voice most closely matches the girl in Surrender's voice)

But Don't Need To Say It is by FAAAAAAR my favorite! It's such a cool sound! Lyrically, this song is an extension - if not a carbon copy - of I Feel It; but this is forgivable in my eyes given the amazing quality of the music itself: evocative of the orgy scene music from Eyes Wide Shut, only better, of course! ;) The vocal engineering is stellar! CRAZY-good!!! And not just on the ""twisted"" bits, I mean all throughout. Just a killer sound with some sweet lyrics that'll make you feel all ooey-gooey inside (or warm 'n fuzzy for the old-schoolers)! Gotta love it!! Can't praise that track enough!

---

Now, despite their exclusion from my list, the remaining tracks on this album are most definitely worth a listen! (Heck, I didn't like Spacewalk at all until the day I decided to play the whole Helium album through for a change. Now it goes into every playlist I create!)

I'd say Fragile is the greatest deviation from anything UMC's done. VERY up-tempo! I almost thought my media player had switched to another album when I first heard it! Took me a few listens to warm up to it, as it's more of a Pop song than all the other UMC songs, in this album or the last.
Friday Night is also quite different, but not as Pop-ish as Fragile. Has sort of a ""YouTube compilation video"" feel to it. But it works, I guess... (again, not a particular fave of mine)

[Note]: There are actually 14 tracks on this album. I'm not sure if an Amazon purchase grants you the 14th (I can't see why it wouldn't, but there's no guarantee), but buying the album (CD or mp3) directly from the UMC site will get you a special download link! :) The last song's pretty high tempo as well, but it's all electronica, zero pop.

---

I know I've made a lot of comparisons between this and the previous album - that this one should really stand on its own, and it does. I just wanted to reassure fans of the original that this is not simply a collection of the same music, nor is it a set of new songs of lesser quality. This is sure to appeal to new and old fans alike!

All things said, Open Up is a more-than-worthy follow-up to Urban Myth Club's monumental debut. If this trend continues, what comes next is gonna be magic!!",1

"Always skipped I always fast-forward past this song when it appears on the Divine Office. ORG Liturgy of the Hours podcast. I cannot stand the sappy-sweet breathy lovey-dovey cutie pie singing or the treacly instrumentation. The worst part is when the music swells (seemingly in time with the swells of the singer's head) and she sings the bridge. All in all, this is a mere erotic love song that does not once mention God or LORD or Jesus. It is not even thinly-veiled. It is a sorry excuse for a liturgical hymn. This song should not only be removed from the repertoire, it should be destroyed with great prejudice and violence to the master tapes.",0

"Not What I Was Expecting The title of this listing is [somewhat] misleading; the actual title of this cd is:

It would be nice if the listing would reflect this; instead of just saying Romantic Clarinet Sonatas. Had I known this I would not have purchased this cd.

The two star rating is based on two things:
1. I was disappointed when I received this disc because it wasn't what I was expecting.
2. I am not much of a fan of this genre of music.

That being said, if you like this genre of music you may very well give this cd five stars; the quality of the performances and the recording seem very good.

The works on this cd are:

1-3 David Tovey (1875 - 1940): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 16

4-6 Daniel Mason (1873 - 1953): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 14

7-9 York Bowen (1884 - 1969): Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 109

The performers are:

John Denman: Clarinet

Paula Fan: Piano

The record label is:

We are missing a classic early creation of music magic by not having this available.

"Love 101 Strings version This is the best version of the Song I have heard. Thanks Amazon for making music available, easy and affordable.",1
"this one is not stereo What a surprise - a remastered version which is remastered from a mono version - the mp3 has 2 channels, but they are both identical. The ""Anthology"" LP version is stereo.",0
"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone Got to have some KRS-One legendary hip hop artist, teacher and scholar... Not like course in Beyonce, Jay-Z or even Kanye. There are neither the root or the foundation of hip hop.",1
"HUGE Disappointment To be blunt - this simply isn't Raintime anymore. While on Flies and Lies they put together a masterful album, for this release, they flopped. The growls and sublime aggression in Flies and Lies is history. For Psychochromatic they opted for not just all clean vocals, but weak clean vocals with none of the passion carried in the clean vocals of Flies and Lies.

I've tried to give this album a chance, but it's just horrible. I mean there is still a few good moments musically, but with all the growls, aggression and passion that made Flies and Lies so amazing and unique (not easy in an genre full of carbon copies!), Psychochromatic is but a shell of what Raintime used to be. It has the fingerprints of sellout all over it and the CD is better used as a drink coaster than music entertainment.

Hopefully, Raintime will get their heads out of the clouds and get back to what made Flies and Lies one of my favorite CDs and - at the time - made Raintime a potential dominator in the genre.",0
"What happened? I was blown away with Flies and Lies. I listened to it on grooveshark. I was going to get all their albums at one point. Thats what I do is collect albums. However, after listening to this album, I have changed my mind about them. I will continue to listen to Flies and Lies, but I will not be buying their catalog for sure. This album just sucks. I don't normally write bad reviews, but they can do better than this.",0
"very dissapointed Raintime finally releases a new album and sadly i must say it is very weak. This album has barely anything in common with their previous album ""flies and lies"" the songs are written in a more commercial and less musical way. the melodic death edge is now on 3 or 4 songs tops on this album. They also pull the ""cut down on guitar solos"" thing on this album. That is one of my biggest pet peeves that a band could pull. The guitarist in this band is fantastic, and i find it annoying that he is now only soloing on 2 or 3 songs on their new album. Raintime sound completely different, and im not happy with the change. There are a few very good songs on the album, but I'd say 65% is pretty bad.",0
"What happened here? I thought I was getting a Raintime album.  I was sadly mistaken.  Not to imply that this band was original because they surely were not.  But I found things to like in their albums.  This album is a complete deviation from their previous efforts.  Again, another bands sells out their fan base for whatever reason.  I feel like I was duped.  This is one of the reasons why people pirate music.  The previous reviewer is too kind on them.  This is not good.  Not in any shape or form.  Plus this is completely boring.  They have turned into an old school metal outfit with modern rock choruses that you hear on MTV and the radio.  They really don't pull it off well.  Growls???..what growls.  If you liked the other albums from them do not get this one.  It's a disappointment to your senses.",0
"really bad, poorly recorded and almost unlistenable The audio quality is so shoddy it sounds like it was done on an old cassette recorder. Also, the speaker's accent is distractingly heavy. I couldn't get through this (perhaps it's that discipline I lack). They do an interesting thing of overlapping phrases, however, I suppose to enhance subliminal effects.

Really sub-par.",0
"Did not receive I had trouble with the download and never had the opportunity to listen to this, and could not find a way to ask for a ""return.""  It may be an excellent product, and the best I can say about it at this time is that I lost only 89 cents and an hour or so of trying to make it work.",0

"Dark synth music from the polar regions Great album! Dark synth music from Norway, cinematic, completely original, beautiful stuff.

"1970 psych/prog I originally purchased this album at a used record store in the late 80's because I liked the cover. There was a short period of time when I stopped listening to vinyl, prefering the convenience of CD's. Unfortunately I sold my copy at a flea market. A few years back I found a copy at a record show and had to have it. If you like to explore the non commercial seldom heard artifacts from the late 60's and early 70's as I do, this is definitely worth a listen.",1
Old School . good music..... Music by Javier Solis my parents use to listen to when I was growing up as a kid. Reminds me of my parents and of my childhood.  Good music. ...... ; ),1
"Sort of a throw-away musical theme from a throw-away Charlie Brown cartoon...turned into a masterpiece! A great arrangement of a Charlie Brown song from the little known ""Arbor Day"" special in 1976. Actually, if you find this cartoon on the Internet, you'll find that that the melody is really hard to pick up and moreover its seems not to be one of Vince Guaraldi's better compositions.

What George Winston did to Vince's throw away theme (in a largely throw-away attempt to cash in on the glory days of the 1960s Charlie Brown classics) was turn it into a piano masterpiece.

In fact, am now learning it myself on piano.",1
"George Winston: ""Monterey"" This record is great, I am a fan of Vince Guaraldi Trio's work on the Charlie Brown movies. I just love jazz in general actually. So it is a great cover - kudos George Winston - his covers album of VGT's music is pretty great. He has his own spin/take and it is really nice to listen too.

*5 stars*",1
"Not as good as the original Not as good as the original, just doesn't sound good.  Get the Vince Guaraldi Trio version instead.  It's much better.",0

"Excellent Social Commentary This music activates you...it's troika of Life, Love, and Liberty will stimulate social justice activists, and I hope, move the complacent among us to ""do something."" Life's ""War on Us"" reminds us that the ""haves"" have ratcheted their efforts to snatch from us simple comforts that give Americans an OK quality of life and instead, celebrating bandits like Enron's Ken Lay, and Bernie Madoff, and hypocrites such as disgraced public figures Ted Haggard and ex-Governor James McGreevy.  ""Big Money Sonny"" slams BP's response to its mammoth oil spill.

Liberty's ""The Trial of Perry Redd"" weaves a common portrait of criminal justice cahoots and the pro se representation that leads to judicial victory. This ""Land of Mine,"" a collaboration with Dirty Redd, rails against gentrification in USA cities, as well as overseas in Palestine. It's on time.

The Love pieces celebrate the triumph of romance and commitment. ""Pianos in a Pumpkin Patch"" might remind you of Prince; it'll pique your imagination. The bounce and kick of ""She's My Girl,"" another collab--with DC local BBD--gets you out of your seat. It's my dance fave; and BBD raps a girl to rapture! My fave track is ""One of Us,"" which asks whether we'd recognize God if he/she/it walked among us. Hmm. ""Trial by Fire"" is 14 tracks of fresh, innovative songwriting, and continues Perry Redd's vein of social activism...his best work yet.",1

"Hendrixian influenced This new release by Vince Hawkins showcases his guitar talents. He obviously favors Hendrix and has a great tone/sound. He may sound like the great master ,but is not a copy cat. His originals on this cd bring his own sound and songwriting to the forefront.

Working in customer service for local government officials will make you crave and savor quiet time at home, and I thought a jazz album would be perfect.  The music is soft, non-obtrusive, and very relaxing.  I would have given the album more stars had it been longer.

"Excellent hard rock/metal band that deserve wider exposure I saw them at Atlanta Fest this past summer (held yearly at Stone Mountain Park) and, while they were in one of the ""side"" tents, I DEFINITELY feel they deserve to be on the main stage and hope they are next year.

In fact I feel they are such a talented band it's almost a shame they are a Christian band. And by that I mean the simple fact that we all know there are a lot of people who listen to this type of music who are turned off at the mere mention of the words ""Christian rock"", which is a shame, a real shame.

Both their playing abilities and compositional skills are top-notch and I have NO doubt what-so-ever that, if not for the lyrics and label, this band would be playing the mid-level club circuit and have major label backing. Maybe even bigger.

But respect to them for sticking to their beliefs and not selling out and conforming to what the mainstream wants, simply for more exposure.  I can only hope that more people wake up to their talent and they get the recognition they deserve.

Me, I'll be waiting for their full-length debut and their next concert in my area!",1
"Christian Rock at its finest I absolutely love these guys.  I've followed them for a long time through the Friday Night Coffee House days.  Their songs have intense Christian meanings and will definitely speak to you.  Don't worry, these are not watered down lyrics and even worse watered down instrumentals.  They have a great sound and have a excellent grungy rock edge.  Seen them live many times and they are as real as you and me and they most definitely love the Lord.

Can't wait to see them release a full album.",1

Anything by MPJ is great! Certain songs I failed to download when I bought them on iTunes and when they didn't show pup shaded gray I decided to buy the one's I was missing from Amazon. And I check with Amazon now as many of their album's are better priced! Any album by Matthew Perryman Jones (MPJ) is worthy in your playlist/library. He is one of about a dozen artist's where I believe I have nearly all their music. AVA- aka Angels & Airwaves is another-they are unique and like MPJ tunes- are always a pleasure to listen to even though I have my iPod's on shuffle- I know when I hear MPJ or AVA in the LR just from the quality of their voices/song! Enjoy!,1

"Stunning I just happened to stumble upon it. The name caught my eye, thought I would check it out. And bam! It's exactly what I was in the mood for. Shoegaze? A little bit. Melodic? Definitely. Emotional? Absolutely. It's one of those albums that could end up being a tour-de-force, it's that good. It has many elements of what I like a lot, a little bit of shoegaze and all very smooth. Nice effects, not too electronic sounding but enough to peak the interests of those who are into that. I suppose some might compare them to Stateless, that sort of thing, but I think this is better than that.",1

"A man, a guitar, and Nick Drake's ghost Alexi Murdoch's ""Towards the Sun"" is a spare, melancholy song that might be about a lost love, a lost connection with God, a feeling of invisibility, the changing of the seasons, or all of the above -- who can be sure? In any event, the song is unmistakeably evocative of and influenced by Nick Drake, the brilliant but troubled British singer-songwriter who died in 1974. (Drake is probably best known today for the song ""Pink Moon"", used a few years ago in a Volkswagen ad.) Everything about ""Towards the Sun"" recalls Drake: the sleepy, oddly accented vocals, the delicate tune, the deceptively simple lyrics, the rhythmically strummed guitar, and the judicious use of background instrumentals that never threaten to overwhelm Murdoch's voice or guitar. If you've never heard Drake, you may find Murdoch's sound to be a stunning revelation ... or not. If you're a Drake fan, you will probably either be wowed by Murdoch's fidelity to the original or offended by Murdoch's imitation of your idol. Maybe both. Regardless, ""Towards the Sun"" is a good song, and well worth a listen.",1
"Excellent album. Some great songs Excellent album. Some great songs, but like any album a few are a bit weak. Overall a great purchase and listen.",1
"Worst of the W CDs I am a big fan of what I call 'vibe' music. I am not such an afficianado that I can talk about lounge vs. chill vs. ambient and actually know what I am talking about. I defer to the 'expert' reviewers for that. However, I enjoy buying CDs that you can set a mood to. I have my La Perla CDs for chilling out and relaxing. I have my W Hotel CDs for entertaining and errr ... making out to. ha ha It has been my experience that these CDs really do set a good mood for when you are entertaining a member of the fairer sex. Not too romantic that it is sappy, not too slow to put her to sleep and not too fast to make her want to dance.

There are several great tracks on this CD, but it is all over the place. It starts off with a song that belongs on the runway of a fashion show (or in a strip club) with Goldfrap's 'Lovely to See You'. This song alone is a hot tune, but it sets a pace that the CD cannot keep up with. There is a hard thumping beat song next which is more typical W Hotel Lounge. This is the one you want to put on before you slide next to her on the couch. Or if you are starring in a James Bond style movie trailer. 'I'm a Fire' by Donna Summer comes next, which is too upbeat after the mellow song before it and sounds too much like something you'd hear in an Abercrombie and Fitch store. I worked there for 3 years, I should know. Next comes 'Yangin' by Zarena, which is straight out of a Turkish Bizzare. It almost sounds like a cross between Bollywood and Afghanistan. Doesn't belong on this CD. The worst song, a terrible remix of 'Angel' by Natasha Bettingfield comes next ... this belongs more on a 'High School Graduation '07' CD mix than it does on a W Hotels CD. Skip this. Another miss comes next with 'Wow' by Kylie Menogue. This belongs on a 'Middle School Graduation '07 Mix' CD. Soooo bad.

'Tell me why' is a sexy song with a hard pulsing beat that belongs in the hippest of lounges. Followed by another teenie bopper type of song that will take anyone out of the mood for romance. It sounds like something that belongs in a commercial for a Canadian department store or a low budget generic 'High School Musical' type tv show. ""Shot You Down' by Audio Bully is an interesting and very sexy song that really would be at home in a New Jersey dance club. While I wonder why this was put on the CD, I can't help but think at some point I might have a use for this song. Just when you think the CD couldn't get any more ecclectic and flow any worse 'Dream Catch Me' comes along which is an upbeat EMO style guitar song that could be used as the music in a commercial for Dawson's Creek on the WB. 'As Serious as Your Life' is an odd song comprised mostly of looped beats and a guitar riff. Very Volkswagon Car commercial. Finally, just to prove they could ... they put the remix of the James Bond theme 'You Only Live Twice' by Shirly Bassy. With a heavy bass guitar in the background the classic 70s James Bond song was done wrong and placed at the end of the CD. The lounge and the 70s glitz just don't go together. Its like watching a James Bond movie while having a Jazz Brunch on Sunday.

This CD is a bit like obscure performance art. It makes you think and ask yourself 'Why would anyone do that?' This is such a mish mash of songs ... most of them bad. I will be taking Track 1, 2, maybe 3, 7, 9 (dont ask me why), and maybe 11 to my IPod. Really though, there are around 3 good songs on here unless your job is to pick the music for car commercials and commercials promoting television shows. In which case this CD would be a goldmine for you. For creating a loungy vibe such as you would find in a W Hotel lobby or bar it doesn't even come close to being decent. It is scitzophrenically bad compared to the usual W Hotel CDs. In fact, I might bring this and leave it in the room instead of taking a CD the next time I stay at a W.",0

"The Return of the Eagle Oh, man, if you loved violins, then treat yourself! very nice spirited song, The Return of the Eagle by Atli Orvarsson. Another song I listen too daily. I really can't get enough of hearing the strings in this closing song. This song was used at the very end of the movie! yeah, it was!! ahahahahah, nice music!",1

This was the only one I found, and I just didn't expect it to be a boring instrumental. I really wish Amazon would let us know more about what is on a DVD.",0
Wonderful Item Great item. Came on time. Item was a gift for someone else and they were delighted. Loved the gift so much.,1

"Carl Bartlett Jr. One of the most rewarding aspects of writing about music in general and jazz in particular is to discover that Independent diamond in the rough. I love going in cold on a new artist and with the exception of the appearance of guitarist Ron Jackson, I had no clue on Bartlett, Jr. but can now say with confidence that he is easily one of the most talented young players to drop a debut release at for what may considered to be the slightly advanced age of 28.

Hopeful is a somewhat conceptualized riff on where Bartlett Jr. views his place in life and the possibilities that lay ahead for his career. An apt title if ever there was one as Hopeful finds a energetic balance between the straight ahead and the modern contemporary without sacrificing either. What is even more impressive is the six of the eight tunes are solid originals and the two covers are the standard ""It Could Happen To You"" and the theme from ""I Love Lucy."" Granted a television show theme caused a raised eyebrow but the tune has wonderful changes and Bartlett, Jr. turns a shop worn TV theme into a swing tune with surprising energy. ""Quantum Leaps (And Bounds)"" is a blistering romp featuring one of New York's finest if not most under-rated guitarists in Ron Jackson. The high octane tune is an exhilarating romp between Jackson and Bartlett, Jr. as though they have played together for years. The solos and trades are well executed and avoid the potential self indulgent pitfalls that tend to plague some debut recordings. An ability to change dynamics and dial it down is executed with perfection on another Bartlett, Jr. original ""Julia B."" The thoughtful ballad opens with bassist Eric Lemon who brings another layer of musical flavor and intense lyrical purpose to this finely crafted tune. Emanuel Harold rounds on the rhythm section on drums along with pianist Sharp Radway to keep the ensemble on the straight but swinging path. Charles Bartlett is on trumpet and turns in a solid performance on the standard ""It Could Happen To You.""

Carl Bartlett, Jr. is the real deal. An instrumentalist with full command of his weapon of choice that being the alto saxophone and showing off mad skills as both a producer and composer, Bartlett Jr. is a legitimate jazz triple threat and a name to keep an eye on. The future of modern jazz is now!

"SUPERB! DO NOT PASS THIS MAGNIFICENT LP UP! SUPERB is right!  I have rarely, if ever, heard Sonny Stitt sound like this.  Everybody knows about his instrumental prowess, so let's talk about his sound for a moment.  On this particular album, Stitt's sound is so rich, so full, so visceral, it sounds as if he's gonna pop right out of the speakers and play in your living room right next to you.  I have NEVER heard Sonny play with such a full, enveloping tone as he does here. At first, I thought he might have quit smoking or something, but there he is with holding a cigarette on the cover.  But he must have done something to obtain the lavish, sumptuous timbre he plays with on With the New Yorkers.

And speaking of which, the New Yorkers in question (Hank Jones on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums) support Stitt with aplomb here, never getting in the way, but playing more than we are accustomed to from rhythm sections on Sonny's Roost albums).  Hank Jones plays several fine solos throughout, and comps well behind Stitt's solos.  And what solos they are!  Sonny, in addition to sounding better than usual tonally, is very much inspired throughout this disc.  Maybe he ate his Wheaties the morning of this session.  I mean, he usually sounds good, but he has never, to my knowledge, sounded THIS good. I'm talking in terms of tone, power and timbre. What a transparent, beautiful sound!

When I noticed that there were no reviews for this album, I knew I had to review it!  There are well over one hundred Stitt albums recorded and some of them are bound to get lost in the shuffle.  So I considered it my civic duty to turn people on to this album, so I could tell the  world (assuming that Amazon RR readers represent the world) the this is an astonishing record that you shouldn't miss.  Please note that I am reviewed the Fresh Sounds vinyl reissue here, and the pressing is excellent.  If you only need one Stitt album in your jazz collection, you can't possibly do better than choosing Sonny Stitt and the New Yorkers (uh, doesn't he play with ""New Yorkers"" on all his albums?).

Anyway, BUY IT!",1
"Took significantly longer than I'd have liked to arrive Took significantly longer than I'd have liked to arrive. But the CD came in PERFECT condition, a real rarity these days. And the performances are treasurable, whether one is a fan of Gould, Mitropoulos or even Schoenberg. The live Bach, also with Mitropoulos conducting, is pretty special, too.",1

"It won't be long before she's on CMT I just saw Karla last night in Cheraw, SC in a tiny auditorium and it was an incredible show. She has a amazing voice, and great songwrinting skills. Also finding out she's from Monroe, NC is quite great considering thats only about a 45-minute drive from my current location! There is not a single track on this album that make you want to hit the ""next track"" button. every track is a solid soulful country song with great depth and heart. It's good to know when she's a big star, I can say I have a signed copy of ""Here I Am"" from when she was just getting started.",1

"I love the Made David Coverdale Famous, I love the Song",1
This CD blows. Do not buy this if you're a DJ hoping for dance track to bang at a club. Yes it's a bargain but most of the tracks have long 2 minute melodic intros w no beat. Then the middle or last half of the songs kick in but these aren't really strong club songs. Really not worth it.,0
"I'm really enjoying this song! I'm really enjoying this soca tune!  Growing up I was always used to that guy that sings ""Hot, hot, hot,"" and then later that guy that sang, the ""dolla"" song.  Remember those political soca tunes????",0

"The Only Good Songs Here are the 3 You Already Know At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.

I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.",0
The Crystals A Great Sound Ranks as one of the great girl groups of the 60's. I wish there were more songs by them.,1
"length This song is supposed to be 3:12 minutes but it cuts off at 3:03 minutes. So you don't get the full song. Every where I looked, Amazon, itunes, Emusic, it was the same. PLEASE FIX THIS.

"Ms. Belle It was a gift so I guess my mom liked it.  Didnt hear anything negative about it so guess she""s enjoyng every song.",1
Save your money! Very short and recorded with almost no volume.  You have to jack up the volume to barely hear the music!  Not worth the 99 cents!,0

"Rather not have received this unconvincing ""love letter"" Julie 16th album for Liberty released originally on Liberty Records in 1962 and produced by Snuff Garrett and arranged by Ernie Freeman is a real snore!  It lacks Julie's exquisite intimacy, sensualism and sophisticated arrangements of her earlier albums. There is honestly not one memorable cut on this album. In fact by the horribly hokey rendition of Never On Sunday.. I was actually slightly insulted.

I'm the author of the book Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook available on Amazon.  As a jazz pianist and vocalist myself who had met Julie London and Bobby Troup as well as performed with several Julie's musicians including Al Viola. Julie called this album herself ""shlock"".  She was forced by contract to mold to current bubble gum pop tastes and started to move further away from the winning concept formula of her earlier cool jazz and bluesy albums.  Also terribly disappointing was the horrific album cover that pencil sketched and not Julie's usually gorgeous photo, there were no liner notes for this album too. It was horrible package haphazardly thrown together. Though she does convincingly give a little tongue in cheek on ""Come On a My House"" ...... but not if this mediocre album is playing. UGG

be sure to check out my book or visit us at julielondon.org for more Julie facts and tidbits.",0
"ugh... I love mya, but she needs to stop",0
Like It! Happy Customer!,1
Five Stars Inspirational!,1
"Ummm... I kinda wish that they didn't do any remixes for this hit.  They don't do Britney or the track any justice at all.  The song is so electronic as it is, it really didn't need to be remixed.  For me to say that is huge...I am a HUGE fan of remixes.  I just don't care ofr any of these.  I recommend the remixes to Till The World Ends, they are all awesome!",0
"IT'S BRITNEY B!TCH The Jump Smokers Remix is awesome BUT they edited out the part of the song that says ""IT'S BRITNEY B!TCH!"" I'm pretty disappointed since that is the part of the original remix that unifies the track and helps build momentum right before the MASSIVE Jump Smokers beat hits!!! Instead, the track leaves you with a moment of silence that in my opinion completely disrupts the overall flow of the song. I'm almost positive iTunes offers the same LAME edited track. NO BUENO!!!",0
Five Stars good resource,1
"Not what I expected I generally like Ravel and thought to try this piece.  It is some sort of operetta or something.  I don't like it at all.  Not sure whether the blame goes to the performers or if it is just not a very inspired composition, but listening is not enjoyable.",0
"Poor Boy, Long Way from Home I have listened to a cover of this song for years, but did not know who did it originally. Robert Pete Williams has an authentic blues style with great slide guitar techniques.",1
NewFound Love from an Old Song Never heard this song in my life until randomly and i have fell in love with QOTSA all over again and have downloaded lots of old stuff in anticipation of their new stuff. :),1
Two Stars This version with a twist and i hate it,0
"Rock Ain't Dead! It Just Smells Funny! Yes, the title is a liberal take on Frank Zappa's popular quote about Jazz. But finally there is a rock album worth the title of ""ROCK ALBUM""! In the past 15 years, rock music has degenerated into derivative displays of musical bravado. Instead of allowing the music to stand on its own and focus on creating fun, entertaining, rock & roll music, bands tried too hard to differentiate and experiment needlessly. And when one band or song got ""popular"", hundreds of copycats filtered through the airwaves resulting in the watered down guitar pop that you hear on the radio today.

This album is a non-apologetic, dirty, sexy, joyride! It's what rock USED to be like! No whining, mopey, ""woah-is-me"" crap! No cutesy engineering magic! This album goes back to rock's roots and reminds you what made rock great!

If you like the old school rock bands where FUN was the order of the day, you'll love this album It is just fun, in-your-face rock! If you like your rock whiny and self important, look elsewhere! You have been warned!",1
"Four Stars Very catchy, earworm piece of music.",1
Mesmerizing beat I heard this song on the soundtrack to Square Enix's Sleeping Dogs and it immediately stood out from the other tracks. I bought it and I love it!,1

"Holy Crap!!! This music compilation of jabbawokeez beats is amazing and inspirational. It makes you wanna do what they do except I couldn't do it cause Im old lol but a big fan and I can never get enough of their dance and music.

"Great Purchase For years I have been a fan of Elvis Presley, especially his religious music.  When I saw this song was available I felt that I must have it.  As usual, Amazon came through.  Only once in a number of years was I disappointed in a purchase from Amazon, but after I contacted Customer Service the problem was resolved.  Keep up the good work.",1
Four Stars Love it,1
Five Stars Perfect for my needs.,1
"Hey Baby won't stop I was hoping the songs would be longer versions of the original but they are not.  After purchasing, you hear the same song over and over with little remix or words..  Just a bunch of mixing and overboard I might add... Was NOT worth the money nor time to download.. Sorry",0
"Wow!  You gotta hear this! I love the passion in this song, the longing, and the upbeat message it contains.  If you love Michael as an actor then you're gonna love him as a singer.  His band is killer.  A lotta bang for just a buck.  Can't wait to hear more from these guys!",1
"Not what I thought I was buying I thought I was buying the Carlos nakai cd, instead I got a cd with 60 second pieces of the original cd. Very sad that someone would sell this as new!

great Received the package ahead of schedule and the book was packed very well to assure no damage came to it.,1
"OK. But I don't think these guys get it. They have the music right, but it seems like they are going with the motions. They don't have any of the correct emphasis within the music itself. It is almost like it you had a computer write the music. Yeah, it is all there, but they missed the feeling and meaning of the song. My idea is that these players (and composer) are not really fans, but are trying to make a buck.",0
"Not the original artists... I was very disappointed and immediately looked to see if there was a way to return this. These songs are not by the original artists or even the artists who performed them for the movie.

"Umm...This is misleading Sadly, this is NOT the musice from the show Sing-off.

"A pleasant, different side to Avril Avril Lavigne has built a full career off of being an angry little pistol of a woman.  You can come away from a lot of her songs, if you're a guy, feeling you just got kicked in the shin (even while enjoying the music).  ""Smile"" is a wholly different departure for Avril.  You still get a dose of the Angry Canadian skatergurl, but you also get the feeling that this is more hopeful song.  Avril seems to be bouncing along, energetically, singing about the positive way her significant other makes her feel.  It's nice to get this happier version of Avril, while she still remains true to her punk roots.",1

"Great songs, great album, NOT FOR YOUNG EARS! My 9 year old and 6 year old girls really love Avrils singing. The songs are fun & uplifting. The problem is they can only listen to half of the album because the other half has to many inappropriate words (CURSE WORDS) in the songs. It is really unfortunate especially on a song like ""Smile"" that has good intentions. Can you make a ""radio friendly"" version of the entire album?!?!
Avril, I am not asking you to lose your ""edgy"" side either, just make a radio friendly version with no cussing! Oh and guess what Avril, that would bring a whole new audience to your music and that means MORE $$$$$ in your pocket! What a concept!",0
"Disappointed This version is not the radio version.  They have removed one word, ""Fu****g"".  They half-heartedly removed ""S**t"" but left the ""Sh"" sound in so there is not much left to the imagination.  And as the previous reviewer mentioned, the word ""b**ch"" is used not once, not twice, but three times.  The version played on the radio replaces this with ""chick"" and has no ""sh"" slur.

Imagine unknowingly downloading this for your 13-year old.

Amazon, I realize that this is a play by the artist's label (RCA) to uphold Ms. Lavigne's ""Bad Girl"" reputation.  However, everything I've ever purchased on Amazon upholds your brand of honesty and integrity.  I recently switched to Amazon to purchase all of my music because I got fed up with The Apple Store.  Unfortunately, RCA pulled one over on you, and you have passively passed it on to the consumer.  Please find a way to exchange the ""radio version"" you sold me for the ""radio version"" that is really played on the radio.  You have the pull.  I'd like to know that in the future I can trust you more than I can Apple.  A brand is nothing more than a promise of value, and today you broke your promise.",0

"Problematic at best As a long time lover of Delius' music, I was keen on hearing this new disc, particularly as it contains the first recording of ""A Poem of Life and Love"", parts of which were later recast (with the help of Eric Fenby) into ""A Song of Summer"". I approached this recording with some trepidation, however, as I've found David Lloyd-Jones to be a problematic conductor, whose interpretations are often characterized by a lack of clear focus as well as rhythmic slackness. Unfortunately, my fears were  justified in this instance.

At 17 minutes, ""A Poem of Life and Love"" is quite a substantial work. It provides fascinating listening, although the sections which were to be later salvaged are all the more conspicuous for their superior musical quality. Much of the rest of the work is second rate at best, with a principal theme sounding like something from Delius' student years. Fenby was entirely accurate in his negative estimation of it (as tellingly recreated in Ken Russell's film), and hearing the original conception makes one appreciate and admire ""A Song of Summer"" all the more.

The ""Irmelin"" Suite (as arranged by Beecham from Delius' early opera) is pleasant enough, although Delius'/Fenby's later ""Irmelin"" Prelude has more genuine musical quality and interest in its five minutes than in this fifteen-minute compilation.

I've always found ""Life's Dance"" to be a problematic work. It predates ""Paris"" (1899) by a year (though it was revised later), and indulges in some of the same Straussian orchestral virtuosity. However, after an impressively energetic opening and a  gloriously lyrical secondary theme, the piece degenerates into a short-breathed and often rhythmically monotonous central section, which cannot be rescued by a return to the opening and a final climax. To barrel through the tedious central portion, as Lloyd-Jones does here, doesn't help matters either, as instrumental detail gets muddied and/or lost in the shuffle. I don't find that any of the earlier recordings by Groves(EMI) Del Mar(Unicorn) or Holten(Danacord) are successful either, though Del Mar comes closest to making this piece work.

The suite from ""A Village Romeo and Juliet"" is David Matthews' revision of his own earlier(1987) version, written at the request of, and recorded by Carl Davis with the London Philharmonic(Virgin). In this revision, the concluding ""Walk to the Paradise Garden"" is replaced with the actual final music of the opera. Given the comparative familiarity of ""Paradise Garden"" I can see the reason for the revision, although I found the original version of this suite to be musically more convincing, as the ""Paradise Garden actually follows the Berghald  Fair scene in the opera, and the transition is Delius' own. Carl Davis' recording of the original version is also much more musically alive as well as better played and recorded. Matthews' new transition to the final scene is a bit awkward in my opinion, as are all of his other transitions, but the idea of a symphonic synthesis from VRJ is a good one. I could imagine a more extended (30-35 minute) suite including both the ""Paradise Garden"" and the wonderful dream music from scene 4.

As I said at the outset, I often find Lloyd-Jones' conducting to be problematic, and this disc is no exception. Granted, the RSNO is not a first class ensemble, but under conductors such as Jarvi or Gibson the orchestra can sound more than respectable. On this recording, however, balances are uniformly bad, with coarse, strident brass and weak upper-register strings, problems which are not helped by the garish quality of the recording itself. Overall ensemble is ragged to the point that this whole recording sounds like an under-rehearsed rush job. The only real reason for acquiring this disc is for the ""Poem"". The asking price by these Amazon sellers is outrageous; I would direct anyone interested in acquiring this recording to prestoclassical.co.uk, where I obtained it for $15.

"From MainlyPiano From the cover, one would assume that John Gatti's ""Destinations"" is a solo album, but is it? Each track sounds like a band made up of piano, keyboards, percussion, and a wide variety of other instruments and voices, but no other artist credits are given. That only leaves one explanation - that John Gatti is a one-man band. Further exploration of the liner reveals that this is the case. Wow! How does one jazz musician keep the music so loose and free yet completely in synch? The only answer to that question is pure artistry, and it's truly amazing. ""Destinations"" is comprised of thirteen original compositions inspired by places Gatti and his wife have visited over the years, and the music spins a mood of joy and unbridled fun. From funky jazz to steel drums to Latin stylings and more, the album provides more than an hour of great music. I listened to it four times in succession while driving from the SF Bay Area to the Oregon Coast the other day and absolutely loved it with the volume cranked up and my sunroof wide open.

""Destinations"" begins with ""Cotton Candy,"" a funky piece with a great beat and laid-back style. Inspired by a vendor at Yankee Stadium, piano, percussion, voices, and guitar provide the perfect groove to get this set started. ""Watermelon Summer"" conveys the easy spirit of getting away for some time by the ocean. If you can keep still while listening to ""Old San Juan,"" you'd better check your pulse! A high-energy piece with a spicy Latin flavor, I love this one!  ""Cast Away"" takes us to the Caribbean and the joyful sound of steel drums. ""Jet-Glider"" has a more synthesized sound and ambient feeling, suggesting the wonder of falling water, air, sky, and freedom. ""Saltimboca"" is a lively piano and percussion tribute to New Orleans - another piece that makes it impossible to sit still - also a favorite. ""Struttin' Around Pines Lake"" brings back some easy funk and synth scat singing (how'd he do that?) backed by a strong drum beat, organ, and bass guitar. ""Tomorrow's Showers,"" for Seattle, WA, is a slow groove for piano, percussion, and synth - very soothing and relaxed. ""Cooling Down"" (San Francisco) is the epitome of West Coast Cool (although it was composed for Joyce Cooling and her husband). Piano, percussion, bass, and synth washes make this an easy-going and addictive gem. ""Pepe's Dancing Feet"" (Atlanta, GA) brings the album to a close with a celebration of good friends, good food, and fun. It just doesn't get any better than this!

""Destinations"" is a fantastic album to lift the spirit and to celebrate life. I expect it to be one of my favorites for the year. Very highly recommended!",1

"Great Music, Disappointing Sound There is so much to want to like about this set.  A full live recording of Demons and Wizards, a great collection of past hits and a nice sampling of new material.  The music itself is well played and the group really sounds in fine shape.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is mediocre.  It sounds like it was recorded in mono and is really compressed; much like an MP3 file.  So don't expect wonderful sonics this time; which is unfortunate since the music is so good.",0
"Disappointing I guess I have been spoilt by ""The Legend Continues"" & ""Magic Night"". This one does not compare, if you are looking for the same polish these other recordings carry. Love the sellection of songs with the exception of the more recent tracks, Angels walk with you and Shadow. I am surprised that these are in the set, when there are so many other classic songs to pick from. I was particularly looking forward to Overload. While Mick's guitar work in this is spot on, it lacks punch. A lot of the backing and harmony vocal is pretty average. There are sections where some of the instruments seem to fade out. There is a desperate need for some mixing here. Overall Burnies vocal work is very good, however, he does have the occassional flat spot. I am probably a little critical. I am sure if this were re-mixed it would come out sounding great. For a bootleg it's not bad but I would probably recommend saving your money and spending it on the other live recordings.",0
Speechless Love It!!! An amazing song..such beauty..,1
"One for the specialist The music of Ib Nrholm (b. 1931) is quite well represented on disc, and Kontrapunkt seems to have championed it with some enthusiasm. The disc at hand appeared to me to be a representative samples; maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but at least it provides no impetus to explore his output further. Nrholm's style is a little hard to pin down; whereas the symphonic fantasy Hearing Andersen and the suite The Shadow are dissonant, expressionist but essentially (neo-)romantic and accessible the fifth symphony is rather forbiddingly dense and uncompromising.

Hearing Andersen is derived from music from a Danish TV production of H.C. Andersen's The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep. It is at least variegated, combining Tchaikovsky-like rhapsodizing with modern-sounding effects. It is also completely without any discernible structure or any redeeming qualities - music hardly comes less inspired or interesting than this, and it adds up to a rather painfully boring 27 minutes. Shadow sounds like a surreal take on late romanticism and impressionism, and although that may sound prima facie appealing I can assure you that there is nothing appealing about the results. In short, these two works are as dreary, hollow and uninspired as music comes.

Things improve somewhat with the symphony, which is a darkly pugnacious fantasy of flittering shadows. It is far less accessible than the other works - in fact, it adopts an uncompromisingly dodecaphonic idiom, but at least there are some modestly interesting ideas in it. Overall, however, it is about as inspired as its inspiration (the four elements - air, earth, fire, water) would suggest. I have no objections to the performances, which are technically adept and full-blooded (although one sometimes gets the impression that the players and conductors are thinking ""why on earth am I playing this"" just as much as the listener is wondering ""why on earth am I listening to this""). The sound is generally fine if sometimes a little constricted. In sum, the symphony may be of some interest to the specialist; the rest is drivel.",0
Five Stars I enjoyed this song very much.,1
"A shame It sounds worse than 'Death Magnetic.'  Really.

And that's a shame because there's good songs here, good musicianship, and so forth.  But there's really not much point in listening to it because it's so blatantly distorted that it ruins the listening experience.  Truly, it sounds like they made a proper recording, and then ran the whole signal through a Boss distortion pedal to make it loud.

As I said: a shame.",0

Redington's sons and grandsons still run the race; he is an icon and a hero to Alaskans.  Hobo Joe's songs, many of which he writes himself, are based his own experiences as a fisherman, logger, and miner, eking out a living as many Alaskans have always done.  He is cut from the same cloth as other folk artists who have put our culture to music over the years.  Though not prolific, he has a number of albums out, all of which I highly recommend.",1

"Disappointing Experience And Who Are ""Mojo""? <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mojo-Presents-Cohen-Covered-Cd/dp/B004QJFGK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mojo Presents Cohen Covered Cd</a>

Firstly the rating I have given does not, in anyway, reflect on Leonard Cohen or the Songs themselves. the major issue I have are with some of the artists chosen.

I doubt very much that Leonard has had any input to the artists chosen.

Another problem is in the quality of the pressing of the CD, which is atrocious, with inconsistencies throughout. To be quite honest it sounded very much like an old Vinyl LP, with 'scratches' and interference in most of the songs.

I will not provide any feedback on the artists who have given a wonderful performance, suffice to say they were all excellent.

I had to play ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"", sung by Claudine Longet, a number of times, to appreciate her voice and the sensitive and subtle way she sings. In the end I felt she gave an excellent rendition of the song.

I have no idea why the following artists were chosen, as there are other artists who would have provided a more enjoyable experience:
1. Linda Thompson did nothing for the ""Story Of Isaac"" and produced a very lacklustre rendition.
2. Eyeless In Gaza (sang ""Priests"") who I have not heard of were, to say the least, grating on my ears. Think of the sound you make when you scratch a blackboard with your nails; that pretty much says it all.
3. Susanna And The Magical Orchestra (sang ""Hallelujah""); refer to my comments for ""2."" above, plus I see no magic in the singing at all!!!
4. Phil Campbell (song ""Take This Longing"") gave a somewhat lacklustre performance.
5. I will provide feedback on The Handsome Family and Mr. David Viner as there is only two words for both, absolute rubbish.

I would be interested to hear what others thought of the CD, or am I the only one who has purchased it?",0
"A Unique, Delightful Musical Treasure I discovered Anne Harris playing her incredible music in a local venue and was immediately entranced.

Anne's music is an incredible blend of influences, with intelligent lyrics, catchy, memorable melodies that pull from her Irish and African heritage, as well, it seems, every place she has ever been to or read about.

"Yawn I heard this piece live on Easter Sunday played on the pipe organ at Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis as the postlude after the service.  When the organist began the piece, people who were exiting the church simply stopped in their tracks to listen.  The sparkling staccato phrases dancing above a deliberately ponderous pedal part echoed throughout the Cathedral.  The piece was just magnificent.  Unfortunately, the brilliance and assertiveness of this piece is lost in this performance.  It is played too fast, with too little emphasis on the commanding passages of the music.  It reminded me of a lackluster recital piece, rather than something you would expect from a grand pipe organ in a Cathedral.  Much better is the Michael Pohl CD Organ Symphony No. 5 in F Minor, Op. 42/1: V. Toccata.  This is available on Amazon.  Avoid the Downes recording.",0

"Nut Tha Kid I got his last mix tape with where you going Mr Peanut on it. Bout to cop this one. I think 50 signed him because he can tell that Kidd wrote Lil Waynes raps when Guille stopped.

Its a shame that the true talent does not get exposed and insteand you associate most of his hottest songs with garbage lil Weezy. Like Ms Officer was a KID thang, and Neck of the Woods was a Guille joint.

I remember when a rap style was like a finger print. When you opend your mouth to spit from the first bar you could tell yea thats a Pac verse or you tryin to sound to much like 2Pac or Spice 1. Kinda like when everybody said BG stole his style from Magnolia Slim. Even BG had to mention it in one of his older songs. Point is Nut does not sound like nobody else except the few instances where he sounds like Lil Wayne, but I guess so because he wrote a lot of lil Wayne verses. Rap has been murdered and drowned in hype, but at least Nut is staying real ya dig. Big ups. Bring Rap Back like the Eddie Bow.",1

"Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser Mailley-Smith specializes in Romantic repertoire, which he plays most deliciously, sometimes a little flamboyantly, always Romantically. It's hard not to like his pianistic technique, although some listeners may find it too fanciful, too dramatic, too ostentatious; too much playing to the audience, if you will. Certainly, no one can accuse him of not being virtuosic, though. He is a most-skilled practitioner of the art, with the kind of poetic style that may seem old fashioned in an age of clarifying, analyzing, and elucidating every note. It seems to me that the best pianists--Pollini, Ashkenazy, Perahia, Argerich, Brendel, Kovacevich, Rubinstein, Gilels, Richter, Michelangeli, Janis, et al--generally combine the two approaches. We'll see how Mailley-Smith proceeds in his career, and whether he can equal what only a handful of pianists have already accomplished.

That said, there's a lot to like here.

Mailley-Smith opens the program with the Fantasie Impromptu No. 4, Op. 66, an excerpt from which you can hear below. The track pretty much exemplifies everything the man does on the disc. It's lush and it's plush, and it will blow your house down. Not that it's slow or lackadaisical, however; indeed, it is fleet and surefooted. It's just that Mailley-Smith so caresses each note, it sounds as though he's making love to the instrument (a Steinway model D). This is not only Romantic piano playing, this is a romance between the performer and the music. It's quite hypnotic, actually.

And so it goes through fourteen items on the disc, each one played in a smooth, flowing, polished, yet thoroughly engaging manner. Mailley-Smith performs with flourish and sensitivity, pointing up every ornate contrast the composer has to offer.

With the exception of just a few items, the numbers on the album duplicate the program presented on pianist Idil Biret's very fine collection of favorites for Naxos. So, I had a good comparison there without having to dive into five or six different CD collections of nocturnes, waltzes, etudes, etc. And what I can say is that Mailley-Smith acquits himself very well next to his older compatriot, matching Ms. Biret in virtuosity and sensitivity and surpassing Naxos's slightly clearer but edgier sound. While it is still open to question whether Mailley-Smith will ever match Pollini or Rubinstein in Chopin, we shall see, but he's off to a promising start.

The Nocturne No. 2 in D flat, Op. 27 is as creamy and dreamy as anyone could wish for. The Etude No. 8 in F major, Op. 10, nicknamed ""Sunshine,"" is all bright light and sunny skies. The famous Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, ""Raindrop,"" exudes the sort of beauty you want, with a wholly appropriate gentleness of touch. The ""Minute Waltz"" comes through with flying colors, and sounds less breathless by the end than we sometimes hear it. Then, there's a degree of melancholic dignity in the Waltz No. 2 in C sharp minor, Op. 64 that's refreshing.

Interestingly, both Mailley-Smith and Biret open and close their programs with the same two selections, the aforementioned ""Fantasie"" Impromptu and the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. Just as interesting is Mailley-Smith's inclusion of the Souvenir de Paganini, a delightful little set of variations one doesn't often encounter. It rounds out a program that quite won me over. Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser.

If I have any minor argument with the disc, it's that it provides less than an hour (55'05) of content. Surely, the pianist has other favorites he could have included, or was it a matter of cost considerations in recording? I don't know, and it's a small matter in any case.

Good, realistic piano sound, too.

Souzay was as excellent live as on  studio recording. I also liked the tenor Tappy as Pelleas. Spoorenberg is a known commodity and sings the role on an Ansermet recording.

"a feast after a six year famine Some artists fall into a rut; they find a niche and stick with it. Megan Slankard is not that type of artist. With ""A Token of the Wreckage"", Megan's four release and third full-length production, she has evolved and is finally hitting her stride. From a young girl with a guitar, she developed the ability to fully orchestrate a song with nothing but her own hands and voice, but even that was too limiting for this artist. Now with a stable backing band of Danny Blau on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Kyle Caprista on percussion and backing vocals, James Deprato on lead guitar and bay area stalwart Jeff Symonds laying down solid bass lines Megan has the ability to fully realize the orchestration she hears in her head.

Many songs found on ""Token"" have been part of her live repertoire for three or more years, making them sound effortless even when wrapped in lilting guitars, complex harmonies and solid percussion while Megan's voice floats above. The overall effect is well engineered, if slightly restrained in comparison to a live performance.

For the Megan fan, ""Token"" represents a satisfying meal after a six year famine and those new to this artist will find it an excellent introduction.",1

For Osborn's version, Eric Bazilian backs her up with his own vocal input, as well as playing electrical piano and guitar. It's a song about faith and your belief in God. Bazilian is quoted as having said the song was written to ""impress a girl"". He says this was a success because they both ""married and had two kids""---how's that for the power of music for ya?

It would have been beautiful sung in her native language instead since she can't pronounce the English words and I would have given it rave reviews if she had performed it that way. I am sorry I purchased this MP3. Even though I know this song's lyrics like the back of my hand I could not discern what this singer was singing most of the time and that made it too distracting to listen too. There are much, much better productions of this song.",0
"Modern day troubadour MURASKO is a modern day troubadour who writes songs that have meaning and sensibility. His music runs the gamut from hard-edged rock to pop and even a little bluegrass thrown in. His lyrics tell stories of personal experiences that all of us can relate to, sung with passion and from the heart.  MURASKO sings and plays all of the instruments on the CD, except drums. He also produced it himself. The songs that I recommend are ""Sitting on a Mountain"", ""The Beach Tune"", and ""Starting Life"", but they are all excellent.  MURASKO'S drummer livens up the music with creative aplomb and good taste.  MURASKO is an exciting new performer who you will not be disappointed in. ""Lost in Razzi Berry Field"" is an exciting musical journey.
I was ""Sitting On A Mountain"" and ""Lost In Razzi Berry Field"". The day was hot, a real ""Baker"". While I was listening to ""The Beach Tune"" on ""KRVA"" and looking at ""Soaring Horizons"", a ""Freedom Fighter"" roared across the sky. It was as if I had just ""Woken From A Dream"" and just ""Starting Life"". Then I realized it was time to get back to the city. How I'll ""Hate"" to see those ""Glass Giants"" again.",1
Five Stars nice sound,1
"Good music, terrible singing I saw this guy perform on the Africa channel and loved his music, rhythms and his time signatures, but his voice is just atrocious.

"Totally Solid Ambient Album, AT's best IMHO. I first heard Amon Tobin on Pandora and in-turn went and got a bunch of his albums. The tracks are very hit-and-miss for my taste. None of it is bad quality, it was that I would love listening to 1/3 - 1/2 of the songs, the other ones I pretty-well leave off my playlists. But THIS album (just purchased and listened through a few times) has well-above the ""love"" ratio of the other albums. This will likely be my favorite full albums of his. Doesn't contain my favorite individual-track(s) like The Killer's Vanilla, but totally an album to put on, in its entirety, and do work (SON!). Such skill this one has.",1

"Lively, pleasing music, extraordinarily well recorded CPE Bach sounds nothing like his father, Johann Sebastian, but more like Haydn. Actually, he represents the link between the Baroque and Classical periods. These pieces are typical of his work, lively and fully orchestrated. They are well played and extraordinarily well recorded. Highly recommended.",1
"Ruined by Amazon Don't get me wrong: the musicians are of prime quality, the repertoire is well chosen and I'd really whished to enjoy this CD. The single star goes entirely for the musicians, and I hope I can get the original CD someday. However, there are too many problems with this product.

1. This is a recorded CD-R, which is less durable than an pressed CD. Yes, Amazon warns about that. What they don't tell you is that what you get is nothing more then a CD with a tracklist. No booklet, no texts, no artist photos -- nothing. In the MP3 version (available at amazon.de as well as the original pressed CD) you can at least have some extra information from the tags in the files. Here you get nothing: if you don't search the internet for a picture of the back cover, you can't even know who composed each piece. What you get here, for the price of a full CD, is only a wax color low resolution single sheet with the track names on it, as if you printed it from a directory listing. The least expected was a high-res reproduction of the original CD covers, front and back, as weel as the booklet. Instead, you can't even figure out who composed each piece and which tracks constitute the pieces. If you do not get a booklet, what is the purpose of buying the CD instead of the digital version?

2. The artists in this recording are or prime grandeur, so I cannot imagine the distortions I hear all over the tracks are the product of a bad sound engineering. This must have something to do with this new recorded-on-demand process. Track 24 is a complete messs, with the high frequency of the violins and harpsichord screaming over the solo and ruining the otherwise great performance. This is not worth the 16 USD I payed for the CD. I'd rather pay the 22 EUR they charge at amazon.de than have a crippled copy comparable only to a low quality pirate CD.

If all the CDs produced on demand are like this one, Amazon is in trouble. Since I only listened to this CD after returning to Brazil, I will not bother returning this item, but I hope this review serves as a warning to other buyers. Buy the original CD, not this crippled fake. The performance is very good, and the musicians deserve their praise. Unlike Amazon, for selling such a bad product, unworthy of their usual high quality standards.",0

I will not ever give any other evaluation than something along these lines, enjoy Amazon.",0

"Just Snippets You can probably tell that this MP3 only contains short little bits of John Williams's fantastic movie scores just from the running times of each individual tune. Unfortunately, these are all strung together, like a medley, and the sound quality is very poor, sounding as though it is all played on synthesizer. (Not that I know whether or not it is, that's just how it sounds to me.) All in all, a very poor product, not worth the price.",0

"Great Album Last Chance To Reason level 2 album is just incredible hard, fast, loud and much much more this album is off the wall good.

Recommend to anyone",1
"Sorry to ruin the 5-star-train I purchased this mp3 album after seeing it on sale for five dollars and having good reviews, comparing them to between the buried. HOWEVER, I made the mistake of looking up the lyrics, AND THEY WERE SO BANAL and retarded, they literally ruined every single song. Repetition of the same word was all any song ever was now to me (much like meshuggah is just crash cymbal after cymbal after cymbal ad nauseum), I couldn't avoid hearing anything else; a misconception about the workings of technology (even allowing some poetic license it's still absurd and just wrong).

I originally thought the band members originated out of the states, I was gonna be kind, say it's a language gap... but no, they're from Maine. Inexcusable drivel. I now dislike this album more knowing that.

And, if I recall, the comparison to BtBaM is understandable, but I feel this is much more stripped of anything interesting, not enough to keep listening. You know what the next track's going to sound like after the first. Hell, you know what the rest of the CD is going to sound like.

I want my money back  =(",0
Four Stars Great,1
Omnivium just plain wow. Some of the songs on this are so intricate and detailed. An incredible cd. They are the best German metal band in my opinion. And a few of the guitar solos are insane. The speed of some of this stuff is great. Very happy with this new cd,1
"Great For Any Death Metal Fan! The riffs are top notch, the solos will blow your mind, and the styles of Death Metal incorporated in the album are somewhat varied.",1
"Awesome voice, AWFUL material. Jinnean has an incredible voice, I love it and that's the reason I bought this cd. Unfortunately the tunes are very uneventful, dull and do not do her justice. Not only that, but they're embarrassingly not contemporary. I love Gospel, but singing ""I kissed a girl and I didn't like it"" to keep the young generation chaste, is absurd and even more so dangerous. Man and woman are made to unite, so why not teach the kids about chivalry, about the beautiful and perfect design of mother nature? In a day where insecurity leads to corruption of ideals, where violence, rage and homosexuality are rampant DON'T TAKE AWAY A STRAIGHT KISS, it's the most beautiful and magic thing we have, if done with the right heart. This experiment failed, it didn't empower me, it is full of redundancy and lacks courage.",0
"Love this recording of ""The Four Seasons"" I really enjoy this recording of Vivalid's ""Four Seasons"" by Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. I feel that it is wonderfully expressive (some other renditions lack emotion or are too stiff) and perfectly timed (some other renditions play it waaaay too fast and others slow down at times when I feel it is inappropriate), all while never being overly gratuitous with the music (some other renditions really go to town on the solos). I've listened to a few other versions, and this is the one I have stuck with.

[P.S. I heard the ""Seasons"" by Eugene Ormandy / Philadelphia Orchestra on another disc prior to finding this one. On the remainder of this disc there are some other tracks, aside from ""The Four Seasons"". I have not listened to these yet, so I cannot vouch for those.]",1
"Love it If you are wanting a fast song, this is a song for you. I recommend this song to anyone! :)",1

It's close enough, but for something saying it's of the Savannah Smiles soundtrack, it's a real shame they didn't add the original version to the soundtrack, and it was a small disappointment. I just went ahead and converted my copy of the movie with that portion into an mp3. Hey, I technically already paid for it here, right?",1
"A New Beginning Trae (Tha Truth) has always been one of my favorite rappers to come out of Houston, TX. He has been around a long time, and in my opinion, is way over due for his time to shine. If it hasn't been one thing then it has been another. Always humble, and doing great things for others, Trae is one person who deserves to shine. Earlier this year, 97.9 Tha Box (radio station in Houston) put a ban on Trae's music and even went so far as to fire some of their own personnel for associating with him. They claim that Trae's music glorifies violence and is better left off of the radio. Trae responds with this powerful mixtape, letting it be known that he won't stand for that kind of bs. Support REAL Hip-Hop: Buy this, give it a genuine listen and you will almost be compelled to scream, ""F*** 97.9,"" for what they are doing to Trae. Like I said, this mixtape stirs up emotions that you just don't find in Hip-Hop nowadays. Trae Tha Truth forever.

Why Purchase??? Good lyrics.....BUT unless you can get your church to memorize a chapter of scripture in under 5 min don't bother with it.  I go to a SGM church and it is really hard to sing along to.  Unless you play this in your ipod 24/7 (including when you sleep).  Ohh and SGM is still stuck in 1990....Maybe 1995 at best...They just realized that Cold Play existed and tried to copy it on the best of there songs.  Good luck.,0
"Major Disappointment I became acquainted with Sovereign Grace Music two years ago at -Worship God-, a worship conference that they host. I was overwhelmed by the depth of the lyrics and the music that gave it breath. Unfortunately in my opinion -Risen- though sound theologically, is horrible musically.
It's not that these songs aren't singable, it's just that they aren't good musically. I plan on attending -Worship God- this year, and hope to find the live versions/tweaking to be a little less boring.

Maybe I need to digest this album more, but as it stands there is no All I Have is Christ, The Fathers Love, Completely Done, I Will Glory in My Redeemer, or Jesus Thank You on this album.
I really hope that SG figures out where they went wrong here, maybe overproducing/too much micromanaging and not enough freedom for the songwriters? Just a guess...",0
"Short song length Kind of disappointing, the Amazon download for this song is cut off in the middle of the song (the length is currently 1:06, just for reference in case they fix it).

Other than the download sucking, the song itself is awesome. Heard it on Last.fm and came here to buy it.",0
"Sweet Little Song I heard this song in the movie ""Apart."" While the movie was just alright, this song stuck with me and I felt the need to purchase it. It's slow paced, melancholic, and at times seems to struggle with continuing to play which makes its fragility all the more alluring.",1

"Biased ""Renaissance"" I like Renaissance music, and have listened to many works or pieces in this category.  This album says ""The 99 Most Essential Renaissance Masterpiceces"".  I totally disagree.  This compilation has Medieval music (eg. Cantigas, Oswald von Wolkenstein, Landini) and early Baroque (eg. Monteverdi).  More surprisingly, I found many unfamiliar pieces.  I had never heard of these pieces such as Georg Bhm, Melchior Borchgrevinck ...  It is a good chance to know these pieces. However, be careful.  I don't think these are the essential Renaissance masterpieces.  This album lacks early Renaissance music especially early English (eg. Dunstable, Eton choirbook, Tallis), Burgundian school (eg, Dufay) , many important Flemish school compmosers and pieces (too many!), and Iberian composers (Tomas Luis de Victoria, Milan).

Overall, it has lots of fan, but not a good overview of so-called ""Renaissance music"", particularly for beginners.",1

"A Stain On The Music Industry Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.

In June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him ""being guilty of a serious criminal offence"". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.

It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.

This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.

More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.

The track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.",0

"Truly awful I have been listening to Curtis Fuller since first hearing him on the legendary John Coltrane album Blue Train. He has always been an innovator and a trombonist's trombone player. He is also a wonderful composer and arranger. This recording lacks everything I have grown accustomed to when hearing Mr. Fuller and I am astounded it was even released. The piano is out of tune, the sound quality and mixing are amateurish and the playing is substandard throughout. The heads are misplayed and so are many of the chord changes. It makes me ask, did they actually have the charts or were they playing from memory? I cannot believe Curtis Fuller had anything to do with this recording and I doubt he knew they were recording his stories for release. I adore his 2010 release, ""I Will Tell Her"" which was also dedicated to his late wife Cathy. Before buying this CD or MP3s, please find a way to hear it first. A lot of music critiques are a matter of opinion and some listeners may like this recording. Anyone with an ear for jazz will (or should) run shrieking from the room upon hearing this horrible CD. My sincere apologies to Curtis Fuller for my comments but the producer of this recording should get another job and should be banned from doing further damage to great musicians' careers.",0

"False Advertsing! There are perhaps two or three Catholic hymns inadvertently included amongst this Protestant collection,  Some, like ""In the Garden"", are actually in conflict with Catholic theology.  Farjeon's ""Morning has Broken"" is a lovely Anglican hymn that then became a pop song (by a singer who then became a Muslim).  Martin Luther, who wrote ""A Mighty Fortress"", is not exactly a Catholic saint.  I don't know what, or if, they were thinking when they named this album.",0

"Beautiful Meditations These instrumental renderings are perfect for quiet meditation. Unobstrusive and peaceful, redolent of all you remember of your early faith.",1
"A lot of NOT Catholic hymns I was hoping to see things like ""Oh Lord I am not Worthy""... and others, but ""Morning has Broken""?  This isn't religious at all--it's a secular song written by a man who converted to some other religion. It's a pretty song--but by no stretch of the imagination is it a ""Catholic"" song.  ""A Mighty Fortress is Our God""  was Martin Luther's battle cry AGAINST Catholics.  Okay--- so if you're strictly looking for nice ""Church"" music... the songs are that... nice.  But to claim these as Catholic Hymns is misleading. Also it's all piano music which can be quite soothing--nothing personal here; but I was really surprised to see so many non-Catholic selections among the list.",0

"No wasted lines in that brilliant show I listened to this because Jeff Daniel's character was singing it in episode 1, season 2 of The Newsroom.  No wasted lines in that brilliant show, so I looked it up.  Brilliantly snide.
So here's my review of the song:  oh my gosh!  friday comes after thursday?  and saturday comes after friday?  who knew?  pretty much the definition of vacuous.  (look it up.  if you listen to this song, you'll probably have to look that word up.)  and the chord sequence is just about as sophisticated as the lyrics are (and her voice is very nasal - not fair to all those amazing vocalists out there).  how does such crap (i started to say mediocrity, but that would be 2-3 stars) get promoted?
This is why it's so funny in The Newsroom.  love that show!  Five stars for that one.

This is quite possibly the worst thing ever made by man. Rebecca Black cannot sing. She opens her mouth and out comes noise. This is a tune that will haunt your sleeping hours...and your waking ones. The music video is equally abysmal, showing all the artistic talent of a young, hyperactive teen's first foray into television.

This song should come with a disclaimer. Listen to it in public and you invite yourself to heroic bystanders coming to the aid of the general public and tackling you to the ground. Listen to it in private and you subject yourself to seizures, headaches, and temporary memory loss.

Anybody who listens to Friday and likes it, should have -- NEEDS to have -- the back of the head swatted repeatedly and remorselessly. Do it for their sake.",0
"Repetitive and dull My seven year old wanted me to download this. Awful music, repetitive and dull lyrics.
Good thing it was free.",0
"You got To Be Either Drunk, Dead, Or Just Mentally Insane To Listen To This Abomination Attention kids or Teens do not listen to this cause it may cause the following symptoms shown below

1. Irritation
2. Hearing loss
3. Sucidal Thoughts

This is for real because this is  the WORST song i have ever heard in my whole life. The senseless autotune the corny songwriting and just the feeling that you regret spending 99 cents on this ABOMINATION. This should not even be called
music it should becould doo-sick",0
Five Stars Just love this song. Haven't heard it before this in years,1
"Would have liked more Very relaxing, although I was looking for more owl noises and without the music.  It does ""put"" me back into the woods, though, and reminds me of nights we camped.",0
"OK music, weak lyrics and vocals I don't remember how I came across this band, but made the mistake of buying both releases without doing much investigation. I gave both albums a couple listens before deciding they just weren't worthy of taking up space on my iPod.",0

Five Stars old time good song,1
Five Stars Great music,1
"Unfortunate Errors Rather than endorse true love, friendship, and peace, the concepts in this song directs people into short term and long term pain, unhappiness, and real sorrow.  The ideal depicted in this song is seeking to fill an emptiness, a void, that only grows bigger the more they are used.  It is like running a car on empty while racing to get fuel by driving away from the fuel station, being so close to getting what is needed but going the wrong direction because of the anxiety of the urgent need, creating total chaos and ultimate failure.  I feel such sorrow for the lunacy of the logic that fuels my friend.",0
"Five Stars Voice of an ANGEL, lol. But also Angel Olsen's voice is enchanting.",1
He does this song justice! Still one of my favorite male vocalists! He knows how to pick the right song for his abilities.,1
"Very disappointing with only a couple of good songs I was really looking forward to this album and bought it without doing any research other than listening to the first single, ""The End,"" which I liked.  If only I could say the same for the rest of the album.  I loved Wired and We Control.  And I salute artists attempting to flex their musical muscles and experiment - but that doesn't mean I have to like the results.

The album is very uneven, with a couple of solid tracks mixed in with some *dubstep* - which I cannot stand - and some too-noisy-to-be-interesting electro.  Some of it's just flat-out awful.  If you like Hyper's previous work, it's worth just buying the tracks where you like the samples.",0
"Not very good This isn't a very good version of A Love Supreme.  It gets better when the horns get busy in the second half, but it's still not amazing.  If you've read my other reviews you know I'm a friend to cover versions, but I don't feel Gordon has added anything to make the composition his own.  I saw the Campbell Brothers do A Love Supreme and they were INCREDIBLE.  This version doesn't measure up.",0
I'm not that old yet. Reminds me of stuffy old rich people. Just not ready for that kind of music. Does sound impressive on my new stereo.,0
"Sophisticated Sexy Romantic A Heart Throb , served rare in my experience.  It will remind you of

someone far away that you always remember even tho your separate

My second favorite Norton Buffalo tune. Another one that keeps getting stuck in my head.,1
Five Stars Awesome disc. So this is what bass heads been raving for... Bass I love you,1
Digital copy sucks Never got it...don't know where to look to get it/,0
"meh! All of the songs in the Album sounds somewhat similar. It appears that he just spent time to make one song good and then tweaked the same song to create others to make it an Album. The 'Bass i love you' song is awesome. and if you like to see your subwoofer moving, choose 'sub excursion'. Other than that it is not worth the money.",0
"Sorry, round file This one failed to please and went into the round file.  Well, at least most of their work is much better.",0
"Perfect! Absolutely beautiful!!!  The hymns are well known, well loved and magnificently sung! Love the organ and men and boys' voices.  Takes me back to my youth singing in the choir.",1
Five Stars currently enjoying these masterpieces!,1
Not for anyone who wants to learn the lyrics of the hymns I wanted to learn some old hymns. I can't hear the words of the hymns. It might as well be instrumental. The Christmas section has seemed to have hymns that aren't familiar. This would be good for someone who is in their 70's or 80's who can remember the lyrics to some of the melodies. They wouldn't however be able to understand whatever lyrics they forgot.,0
"Outstanding song to listen to. Inspirational, uplifting, just what everyone needs to hear to have an uplifting day.
The lift we all need to have a better focus on Christ.",1
"better with tate This is an old Newsboys song but with new singer Michael Tate on the mic. I loved the old version but I'm just head over heals for this one! the production is a little different,where the old version has stringed instrumens this has more synthetic sounds. Better backing vocals. I'd like to see more of Michael Tate singing some Newsboys classics.",1
"Loved this song This band has some great polka music, this was fun to listen to and is more on the modern side.",1
Five Stars Great band,1
"Mighty To Save song by the Newsboys This song is the ""new"" Newsboys remake on a popular Christian contemporary song. Song is very worshipful.",1
"michael tait's resonant voice is clear and still fun a wonderful blend of contemporary, a little hip-hop, with clear&crisp, easily understood vocals, and some traditional sounds. Michael Tait(from DCtalk)is lead singer in this cd and continues the newsboys outstanding reputation for quality music and deep messages.",1
Five Stars I like this song,1
"Jesus Freak by the News ""boys"" This is a really Awesome song done by one of the ex members of Dc Talk it's done different but still Awesome: )",1
She is awesome. You missed her. She is awesome.,1
"This song sucks! This song should not have been added to the special edition version of my favorite album of all time.  The Unforgiven!

It doesn't fit the album and that's probably why it was left off in the first place.

Dubliners at their best What can I say? It's the Dubliners! The Lord of The Dance done by The Dubliners...can't go wrong....get it. OK gotta' write more but I already got my point across...good Irish music praising Our Lord Jesus...Happy Saint Paddy's Day! It is my favorite version of the song.,1

"One of the best Christian songs The Risen Christ is one of my favorite Christian songs. Beautiful tune, touching lyrics, and great performance - it's a true praise and worship from the heart.

The risen Christ my Shepherd is.
He graciously my soul doth feed.
My Christ is mine, and I am His.
How can I lack or e'er have need?

In pastures green He makes me lie.
My soul He satisfies always,
The restful water leads me by,
In fellowship and perfect peace.

I often stray; He seeketh me
To yield my heart to His control.
For His name's sake He leadeth me
And shepherds my oft-shaken soul.

Incredible the thought beside--
Pursuing Thee all care is stilled.
Thy rod and staff support and guide;
My way is with Thy presence filled.

Emboldened in Thy victory,
I feast surrounded by my foes,
My head anointed bountifully,
My cup with blessings overflows.

Thy love the measure of my days,
Thy grace a boundless treasure store;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forevermore.

Praise the Lord!",1

"Not my style I wanted to like this--I first found out about Natasha Leggero from Burning Love (the webseries/tv show) so I thought she'd have my sense of humor... instead she was just well, mean.

Paycheck's last record released on Epic. (1982) Underrated. I love every song on this album! Surprised the only hit was D.O.A. A  few others made it as 45 rpm singles as well,1

"best  thing  stampede  ever  did wow  i  was  thrilled  to  hear  this  long  lost  uk  outfit  was  back  together  a  year  or  so  ago  but  i  had  no  clue  this  comeback  cd  would  be  as  good  as  the  archer  brothers  said  it  was  going  to  be,  this  album  is  even  heavier  then  there  classic  white  wine  n  roses  ep  or  the  live  bootleg  from  1982,  it  leaves  there  last  opus  (hurricain  town  1983)  in  the  dust,  to  bad  it  took  28  years  for  this  to  follow  that  album  up  but  this  is  about  the  best  comeback  album  ive  ever  heard,  very  oldschool  production,  very  oldschool  sound  a  must  for  nwobhm  fans,  there  is  nothing  modern  sounding  about  this  record  i  could  play  this  for  you  and  if  you  did  not  know  any  better  i  could  tell  you  this  was  recorded  in  1982  and  you  would  belive  me  that  is  how  oldschool  this  is,  a  total  must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"I close my eyes. The only reason I have this CD is that my sister got a copy for free and gave it to me.  I guess the idea is that it is supposed to be ""lounge music"" with a modern dance beat.  Whatever they were trying to do here, it doesn't work.  It is very boring instrumental music, other than ""Away"", which is a song sung by an anonymous female vocalist who is buried so far back in the mix that it's hard to undertstand what she's singing.  I have no idea who is responsible for this dreck, since there are no producer, writer or musicians credits on the CD.  Too embarrassed to take credit for it, guys?  Can't say I blame you.",0
"""Vegas"" doesn't really describe it well. From the title, you would think it's lounge music, wouldn't you?  WRONG!  It's trance meets Macarena meets Oxygene meets Adiemus meets Legend of Zelda.  Still, it would make fine background music for a lovemaking session with a woman you didn't really care if you ever saw again.  A cow-orker got this as a freebie from some DVD-of-the-month club and gave it to me.  I am glad that neither of us actually paid anything for it.",0

(Which is as well; the last time I suggested a change to Amazon back when it was possible- suggesting to Amazon that a book by Donald Francis Tovey could not have been copyrighted in 1870, given that he was not born until 1875 and was not known to have been much of an embryonic talent in the making - my suggested change was rejected. So goes, though, so goes!)",0

"Donaggio's not Brubeck's compositions Oh, I did NOT read the fine print, so to speak!  I was so excited when I saw the title I neglected to look at the artist/composer.  I was looking for Dave Brubeck's jazz compilation and not what I received. The selections are similar; I enjoy soundrack scores and if there was more variety I would have given it more stars.  Maybe when I am less disappointed I will re-listen to the soundtrack and enjoy it more, but today, quite dissatisfied.",0

"Carter Family...really??? I bought his CD because it has A.P., Sara and Maybelle on the cover and I figured it was their recordings from the thirties. Wrong. I don't know the various relatives of the Carters, but this was recorded in stereo, thus had to be at least late fifties, sounds like the seventies (electric guitars and a Bobby Goldsboro tune). There are no liner notes, just song titles and no song writers. It was made in the Czech Republic, so maybe they have no idea who these people are (is this the family that lived in the White House in the seventies?). The music's not bad, but I'd sure like to know which generation of the Carters is singing (third removed nephews and nieces?). Finally, the best compilation I have is ""Keep On The Sunny Side: An Introduction To The Carter Family"" which has a great booklet and cover.
Hope this is helpful.",0

Great epic music I crave new epic music and this one delivered. It has a very dynamic range. It's a blood pumping score done in a very classy style. I highly recommend it.,1
"Defective MP3 file This recording contains a fine performance of the first two movements of Richard Strauss's Sonatina No. 1 (""From the Workshop of an Invalid"").  Sadly, in place of the third movement, the MP3 download simply repeats the first movement.  Hence the single star.",0

"You will still need a french language course I am a fan of subliminal programs although not of brainwave binaural beat programs, and I bought this one to motivate me to try a French language course. However, I must say I am tired of subliminal CD's and MP3's that do not let the buyer know what messages they will be receiving in their music, nature sound, or ""silent"" programs. Silent? Does that mean homeopathic subliminal, ie-nothing in it?
A list of the suggestions would be especially nice on the subliminals that cannot be heard over music, nature sounds, etc.. This is one of those programs-ocean sounds to learn french. But it does not say crave french language studies,  learn/adapt to French more easily, or actually learn the language, ok, clearly the last one-not. Should one listen during studies,at night, before study, after study, what is the purpose? Also, if this is a brainwave or binaural it should be labled as such.
Now here is the truth, the most one can hope for in subliminal language learning programs is to heighten the desire to learn the language, take a class in the language, or heighten the ability of the listener to learn or develop linguistic skills when they are in classes, working the speech lab, or using a language course/album. This album lacks a description of which type of message you are getting.
Although this is a pleasant sounding program, nice ocean sounds, etc., I prefer the types of programs where one can audibly hear the suggestions even if only as a whisper in the background. Also, whether I can hear the message audibly or not, I cannot see why the makers of these programs are unwilling to provide a description on the site of the messages used in the programs. Some of the programs I purchased for weight loss were nicely effective after a couple of weeks. They had audible messages in the programs and lots of reviews.
I have not yet gone 2 weeks with this program, but a similar program I purchased for another issue with ocean waves and no audible message has not been effective. My husband said at this price just try it. I gave it two stars for having really soothing sounds. If if works I will update the review. I will try it but it is time to get message descriptions on these subliminal MP3's &CD's. If you listen to the previews, some of them are great, some are not informative of content other than a title, some include binaural programs but don't say that on the covers/titles, some are simple meditation programs, some appear to be scientology subliminals,& others are downright weird. Please start giving clear content/message descriptions so buyers can be sure of what they are buying!",0

I then joyfully discovered this EP and a second called, ""The End is The Beginning."" After listening to the samples I bought them both. What a great voice and great lyrics. The band and the songwriting are also excellent. There is a lot of Christian music today that is good. These guys are a cut above. I hope people will fall in love with them as I have and their success will mean more great music from Cloverton.",1
"Good Song I heard this on a tv program and liked it, so I paused the program and, using my Shazam app on my cell phone, identified the song. We have found a lot of good songs that way because programs like The Black List and CSI have great music.",1

Love this song My favorite song!,1
"Love this soundtrack, have no idea where it went So I bought this a couple years ago and I loved it so much. I use these sorts of soundtracks to help me concentrate when writing my book and I got a new computer since I bought it, and now I can't find it. I know I bought it from Amazon but now it's not in my cloud, which makes me very sad because this is a beautiful soundtrack for a sims game. Usually The Sims doesn't make me think of wonderful soundtrack music, but this one does. So now I need to figure it out so I can listen to it while I write again.",1
"I'll say it again: Very Underrated Artist I wrote a review for his sophomore album prior to this one (in case my headline didn't make sense). I love both of his albums & I'm eager to hear the rest of his 3rd album. My favorite song on this album: All Night to Get There. I first heard his music about 3 years ago & he's been a daily listener for me ever since. It'd be nice if the current country ""hits"" now sounded like this.",1

Perfect Part of my wife's themed going away party for her friend!,1
Great CD. This CD has you going.  E40 is a great artist and i cant wait to see what he comes out with next.,1
"The Bay Area King is Back! As I said in my other review this album is fire. Both albums are great and if you are a true 40 fan you will not be disappointed!  The beats and lyrics are bangin, a true spitter is what 40 is.  You do not find to many albums where you can listen from beginning to end but on these two albums you can.  Some of the songs have ok beats but that doesn't matter because the lyrics make up for it! I would definitely recommend getting both of these albums!!",1
"Entrancing sounds for your background! After being linked to ""Saying"" from a friend, I sought out and purchased the EP. After hearing ""Saying,"" the other four tracks on the EP are well varied, really only tied together by Vital's interesting voice and the upbeat feel of all the tracks. Vital's voice reminds me of Kid Cudi, though his lyric work is simplified, mellow. He ""ooh""s and ""ahh""s quite a bit, and I can hear his voice over a Telepopmusik track. Neither bad things, mind you.

The five songs travel from relaxed and atmospheric (Saying) to bubbly (Going Back) to radio-friendly, rock-ish songs (Read It and Airport). While I overall enjoy the sound and feel of the Vital EP, I enjoy it more as background music and not as a direct listening experience. Worth checking out if you like laid-back, aurally varied music.",1

"MP3 details... E-40 (Hillside)
This file was D/L'd and upon review had a bitrate of:  237 kbps (variable)

Also, for some reason (either, originally made or was file modified-upload),
but this file had massive ""clipping"" and distortion. Used Audacity to detect
clipping areas in the file... the results looked like a solid red-brick. Not only
was certain and various or specific bass note freq. enhanced/modified/gain
but also higher frequencies at ""in-consistant"" cycle through-out the song.
...
Imagine a repeating 5 second tempo or rythmm.  It would show clipping or
distortion for a ""certain"" note but may or may-not (consistantly) clip/distort
the same note when repeated (if that makes sense). It's just odd that some
notes were adjusted/increased w/ no consistency or pattern....in the scale.",0

"This one should have done better! Here is one that slipped by a lot of fans of UO, this is the bands 2011 comeback album.  While this isn't a blockbuster comeback CD this is a good sturdy addition to their catalog that will please most of the bands fans.  It should have done better!",1
Five Stars A masterful album. Abdullah Ibrahim and Ekaya at the height of artistry.,1

Joan Sebastian Great artist.... Always has something new to listen to. Great song with such good quality. Just about love any song this person composes.,1
"Tina at her finest! Phil Spector was perhaps wise to ban Ike from the studio when Tina laid down her gut-wrenching vocals. The urban legend has it that the lack of success of his ""Wall Of Sound"" crowning achievement in the U.S. angered him to the point that he nearly disappeared from the music scene until he got hold of Let It Be...although this track was a massive success everywhere else. I'm glad this version is now widely available as opposed to the lame non-Phil re-recording that shows up in later greatest hits packages. Now, if we can just talk Celine Dion into releasing the version of this song she recorded with Phil at the controls, and not the so-so Spector-less version that was released.",1

"IKE AND TINA TURNER PRODUCED BY PHIL SPECTOR. HOW COULD THEY MISS!

"I have been a huge fan since the 1960's! I first heard Tracy Nelson in the late 1960's, early 70's and bought everything I could find by her. She has an amazing voice and can really do the blues. This CD does not disappoint, but then I have loved Tracy's music over 4 decades. She is a vastly under appreciated artist in my opinion, but then, some of the best never made it big in mainstream commercial music. Good seller, no problems.",1
"Blues News I wasn't sure how I would like this album once i heard it fully. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was much better then I had expected. A Winner!",1

"Not ""Complete"" How this can be called the ""complete"" soundtrack is beyond me, when Ray LaMontagne's adaptation of ""Empty,"" is missing?  The ending-credits song was obviously adapted from Ray LaMontagne's ""Empty,"" but it is not quite the same, and it is missing from this soundtrack.

"This song is on fire! The first time I heard ""Ring of Fire"" it was a version by June Carter Cash.  I hated it.  Hated everything about it, from the country twang and plodding beat to the cryptic yet sappy lyrics to Carter's painful-to-listen-to singing voice.  Johnny Cash's interpretation wasn't much better with mariachi band overtones, but at least his voice was easy on the ears (as is the original release by Anita Carter, June's younger sister).

When I first heard Adam Lambert's cover, I had no idea it was even the same song.  Pitched in a minor key with middle eastern overtones, Lambert's musical phraseology breathes new life into the previously incomprehensible lyrics.  In fact, they are so sensual that I took some time to research the song to see if he changed any of them.  While I didn't discover any significant changes by Lambert, it seems there is an urban legend that Cash actually wrote the song but gave Carter credit for it so it wouldn't get tied up in his upcoming divorce from his first wife, and that the phrase ""ring of fire"" is a reference to female genitalia.  (I wonder if Adam knows...?)

My only complaint is that the song is over way too quickly.",1
"Great release from a fantastic band I fell in love with this band's debut album, ""There be Squabbles Ahead,"" and purchased this release afterward.

It's not as upbeat as many of their previous songs, but I believe it fits their theme perfectly while at the same time sounding different from the rest of their work. A lot of great bands don't do that so well, and I was very pleased with this song.

If you like dark, original, musis, unique in both vocals and instrument, I recommend giving this song, and this band, a try.",1
"The song's light tempo and simple melody is very good to listen. Someone recommend me this song, so I listened on Kevin's website and decided to purchase it. The song's light tempo and simple melody is very good to listen.",1

"Marvelous Rachmaninov...Marvelous Sound I have some of these recordings on a late 90's Great Pianists/Phillips recording  but have read glowing reviews about the latest transfers  by Mark Obert-Thorn,who has remastered the original 78's in 2008 or 9  for Naxos.  Unfortunately, they are not being sold in the U.S.  and I had to import from Germany via an Amazon distributor for  about $10  delivered.  Still, it was worth every penny  as  Rach's piano now sounds almost like it was recorded in the early 50's ..so noticeable are the improvements to the piano timbre and solidity of sound.  I have ordered Volume 3, which includes him  recording all of his solo works  plus those of other Russians . Can't wait to get it...  and also VOL 1..which is not currently available via Amazon.",1

"Bad Bon Voyage I have much of Stephane  Pompougnac's Hotel Costes collection. While some are better than others, this one (Costes Presente Bon Voyage) is an absolute rip off. The music itself is far less original than what I've come to expect from Stephane. Also It lists 14 tracks on the CD cover. The disc only has 12. Thinking it was a bad disc I exchanged it with the dealer through Amazon. Still the same problem. So, Buyer  beware. Thankfully, Amazon and the dealer have integrity. Can't say that much for the original distributor who put this on the market to begin with.",0
"This makes and otherwise good recording totally unusable for teaching the song to preschoolers A slightly longer sample or one from a different part of the music would have alerted me to the fact there is a very strange note 11 seconds in. The second occurrence of ""David"" has a pitch on the second syllable that is different from what anyone else sings or appears in any of the printed music. This makes and otherwise good recording totally unusable for teaching the song to preschoolers.

Only a boy named David
Only a little sling
Only a boy named David (""vid"" of David is the problem pitch)
But he could pray and sing
Only a boy named David
Only a rippling brook (preview sample begins on the word ""brook"" and continues to end of song)
Only a boy named David
But five little stones he took
And one little stone went in the sling and the sling went round and round
And one little stone went in the sling and the sling went round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round and round
And one little stone went up in the air
And the giant came tumbling down",0

"A Great  Early 90's OOP Soundtrack This is truly a great soundtrack
If you love the Adventures of Ford Fairlane it a must have
I came across the cd soundtrack around 1996 in a used cd, vhs, video games Store
I know at the time i over payed $9.99 give or take but, it was just very cool to find this cd
Since i loved the film I mostly got it for
Cradle of Love but, this soundtrack is really good top to bottom
It's a strong album to a film that came and went due to various special interest groups, etc,
(See my Love letter to the Adventure of Ford Fairlane Blu Ray)

Track Run down listing is as follows:
1.  Cradle of Love (Performed by Billy Idol) you can know gets this song on Billy Idol's Greatest Hits Album
2.  Sea Cruise (Performed by Dion it's a so/so cover.  now it's sounds a bit dated Not the worst cover though!
3. Funky Attitude (Performed by Shelia E.) Still a very good sounding pop song it makes me wonder where Shelia E really went the chick can sing!
4. Glad to be Alive  (Performed by Teddy Pendergrass & Lisa Fisher)  Awesome SOng!!!!!  this track alone should make any music fan pick up this cd not sure if you can get this on mp3.... Great simple song but, it's so good perfect song! I'd love to know if Electra Records ever tried to push this song as a Radio Single it's really good
5. Can't Get Enough  (Performed by Tone Loc)  this is the track on the cd that dates this entire cd doesn't hold up terrible song
6. Rock 'N Roll Junkie  (Performed by Motley Crue) Great Rock song I'm pretty sure you can find this song on other BO Albums too though
7.  I Ain't Got You (Performed by Andrew Dice Clay) Not terrible but, it's a novelty song
was there smoke and mirrors during the studio time while he did his vocals??? maybe? maybe not??? people forget The Dice man use to be able to Mimic people like Sylvester Stallone,  and John Travolta
8. Last Time In Paris  (Performed by Queensryche)
9. Unbelievable (Theme from ""Ford Fairlane""  performed by Yellow
10.  The Wind Cries Mary  (Performed by Richie Sambora)  another cover but, a HQ cover this is another song that makes this cd a must have

You can still snatch this for a pretty cheap price
It's without a doubt worth it
It's one of the most unrated motion picture soundtrack with 8/10 very strong tracks

9.5/10",1

They seem like they were recorded in down time on the tour and aren't terribly serious. There are no ""hits"" amongst this collection. And unfortunately, while most of these tracks aren't bad, they would be filler tracks on a regular album. So you end up with a CD of nothing but filler tracks.",0
"The goodbye letter to C.C. DeVille Native Tongue is a very strange album mostly due to the shift
C.C. DeVille was thrown-out of the band publicly and grunge rock was becoming the flavor of the week

They went from Glam rock band to a stripped down blues rock band
Not nearly as cringe inducing as when Staind's Aaron Lewis went from heavy metal to country
The album itself is average but, has four very amazing tracks on it non the less
""Stand""
""Body Talk""
""Theatre of the Soul""
""Until You Suffer Some (Fire and Ice)""

""Theatre of the Soul"" is  a break-up song about former guitarist C.C. DeVille  and it's down right sad and beautiful at the same time
It's on the same level as the likes of ""Every Rose has It's Thorn"" and ""Give me Something to Believe In""
 You wouldn't know this was Poison in 1993 it's amazing and was never pushed as a single wish makes no sense

I'm sure most rock/ hair metal fans missed Native Tongue due to the likes of Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice In Chains,
Soundgarden taking over the music scene but, the four tracks i brought up should be discovered and cherished
they are all solid rock songs that got buried by a changing fad
Check out Theatre of the Soul and prove me wrong it's not  a flawless and heartbreaking song 10/10",1

"From 1962 ~ a great song ~ a favorite Like to never found this single, 'Life's too short"" to download. A great song from the Lafayettes in 1962.
This pop-rock group had only this one song to chart, RCA Victor #8044 (b/s 'Nobody but you' ~ R&B flavor)
It's chart # (87) doesn't reflect the songs energy and spirit. I loved it the first time I heard it.
In high-school at the time, ran right out an bought the 45 record. Looked for it a long time to download.
Couple years ago happened to find/buy the original recording on itunes. Sadly, for now it's gone from there also.
Both can be found on YouTube

"The sound of this album really grabbed me. I bought this after listening to a couple of tracks online. The sound really struck me, it had atmosphere and emotion to it. Keys play a large role in this album driving a number of the tracks.  It's unique, but then at times still recalled the Thursday of old, with the intensity of the vocals and guitars.

My favourite tracks are: No Answers, Sparks Against the Sun, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart and A Gun in the First Act. But all the songs are well worth listening to. No skipping tracks with this album.

All in all a pretty fantastic album to end their brilliant career.",1
"Love it! I've been a fan of Thursday for years. They can't do wrong in my eyes. I love all their albums. Ever since I got this album I've played it non-stop daily. That's how amazing it is. My favorite songs so far are Fast to the End, Turnpike Divides, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart, No Answers, Milimeter, etc.

The instrumental on Turnpike Divides is awesome. Hearing them play this song live is even better. I just saw them along with Taking Back Sunday in concert and Geoff is an insanely good singer/performer live.

I love how Thursday changes it up on every album. They're unique that way. I don't get why some people seem to want them to make albums similar to Full Collapse or something. I just don't get how anyone hates Common Existence or ACBTLD. Both awesome in my opinion. I listen to both of those albums a lot.

Go get this album. If you criticize it, I just have to shake my head at you because you don't know good music.",1
"Exceeded Expectations I've been a fan of Thursday since I bought `Full Collapse' in 2002; I've since acquired all of their albums with my favorites being `Full Collapse' and `City by the Light Divided' and my least favorite being `Common Existence' (which still  wasn't really a bad album, just uneven).  I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't anything that seemed `bad' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I highly recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the perfect balance of what I believe they were trying to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - maybe 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  However, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes complete sense and is a perfect move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (unfortunately) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any better.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.  It's their best work so far and has potential to go down as one of the best albums of the year, regardless of genre.",1

"Not very good A so-so recording of a not exciting performance. Very sad, I had high hopes. ""Doc"" rambled around the notes, but little solid music. I cannot reccomend this CD.",0
"Awesome Musicians, Horrible Performance First, an important note: this is an on-demand recorded CD-R disk, not a pressed, manufactured audio disk. That means that some audio equipment may have difficulty reading the disk (mine does), and the permanence of the recorded audio is in question as the dye layer of the disk ages.

About the music and the performance-- Vivaldi's concertos are often fairly light music but beautiful if performed appropriately. Unfortunately, some conductors and instrumental groups like to put their own highly individual stamp upon the music they perform, and the original composers are usually dead, so are not present to protest.

These performances are melodramatic and unpleasant. The audio is artificially constrained and too soft for long passages, and then suddenly, overwhelmingly too loud. The violins and other strings, which can sound so sweet, are instead used to imbue a maximum amount of annoying, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard, screechy and grating tonality to the music, as though the conductor were trying to force Vivaldi into the mold of angst-filled German ""sturm und drang"" music, making Vivaldi into high drama, or rather, inappropriate and almost dissonant melodrama.

The musicians are superb, which makes me angry that the interpretation of this music is so idiosyncratic and in a style that I regard as inappropriate for the music and musical period. Although others may disagree, the earnest, aggressive but ill-conceived performance ruins the music, in my view.",0
"This is NOT the Ormandy. The Salzburg Choir w Kurt Prestel is incredibly bad in almost every way... I have three other Carmina Burana CDs pretty much memorized to compare this to, and have seen it performed twice in different cities.

This CD is a DDD recording of Kurt Prestel conducting the Salzbur Choir and Orchestra...

The vocalists are mostly very good performers. They enunciate. They hit the right notes. Most of them are just about perfect. But the baritone is HORRIBLE. He has no strength or focus. There are two important parts during which HE CANNOT EVEN HOLD A NOTE!! He actually takes a breath where NO one else ever needs to.

And the orchestra is small. There is no Gong during the last few seconds of O Fortuna, for example. And they sometimes sound like a High School Band. The musicians almost always hit the right notes, but they are clumsy at times, and the conductor just doesn't seem to get the feel for any of the music, or the work as a whole. The timing is way off. It's staccato too often, and way too deliberate, like a literal reading of music. It's just Not Magical OR Professional.

Technical Quality of Masters Classic CD from Holland
This DDD recording sounds hissy if you don't turn the treble down to -1, where most CDs sound best at +3 (on my car sound system). Plus some loud parts are very distorted. It actually gets much worse in the second half, which never happens on DDD recordings.

* * *

Now, if you'd like to know about the other two in my collection...

* * *

Carl Orff TRIONFI - Rundfunk Sinfonie Orcheter Leipzig

This is a 2 CD set of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana Trilogy.

After Carmina Burana, the Catulli Carmina and Trionfo di Afrodite are quite disappointing performed by anyone, but worth hearing at least once. It's just that I cannot recommend this box set for the performance of Carmina Burana.

The vocalists and orchestra perform accurately, but...

1. Several parts are sung much too fast.
2. In a few parts there is so much R rolling that it is distracting.
3. Too many parts are sung deliberately instead of joyfully.
4. It sometimes sounds angry instead of magical.

The Technical Quality is OK. The highs are bright and clear, but there is hardly any bass, and really MUCH MORE DYNAMIC RANGE ON THIS CD THAN MOST CLASSICAL CDs. This CD goes from so quiet that you cannot hear it, to so loud that it hurts the ears much too often. And again, it does this Much More than Most Classical CDs!!

* * *

The Philadelphia Orchestra, Eugene Ormandy ****

My favorite so far is not as bright and clean as the Ozawa, but is the best performance I have heard on CD. It is an older recording with The Philadelphia Orchestra led by Eugene Ormandy, and The Rutgers University Choir. Harve Presnell is the featured soloist in this performance, which is a claim to fame for my area since he went to Modesto High School. Also, if you watched The Pretender (1996-2000), he was Miss Parker's ""Daddy.""

This was the best performance over all that I have heard on CD, but if you want the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana...

* * *

The Berliner Philharmoniker, Seiji Ozawa ***

Seiji Ozawa conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker is not the very best performance, but definitely the best sounding CD of Carmina Burana that I have heard. It's bright, deep, clean, and clear with full range and no distortion. It also doesn't get too quiet in the quiet parts, and then too loud in the loud parts. That never happens on this one. It just sounds fantastic.

But apparently others are even better. I'm going to get the highest rated one I can find.",0
"Galuppi Served Well This album has haunted my aural memory for a long time. This is the second copy my husband and I have owned---having given our first away to a very good friend. Galuppi is one of the marvels of Venetian baroque music, but his works have seldom been recorded well. Often, the harpsichord pieces sound too reverberant---possibly because of the conditions under which they are played and recorded. This Claves recording is marvelous in its balance; and the pieces performed are simply sublime.",1
"Mozart, Lord of Oboes Nowadays I rarely hear new Mozart but here is an occurrence: this is my first encounter with K 293, the unfinished Concerto for Oboe in F. Resident in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the autograph consists of 61 measures of its opening movement. The entire ritornello and first two bars of the soloist's entrance are fully instrumented. Thence, the oboe presses on alone for the remaining eleven bars before petering into silence. The instrumentation stipulates Violins, Violas, Bass, 2 Clarinets, 2 Bassoons, 2 Horns. Chronology-wise, here is one instance where K1 was right on the money.  Einstein's attempt to reclassify the fragment as K 416f was discredited by Tyson.

The music itself is a delight. It is less perky and more pastoral than K 314. Robert Levin - the defiler of K 297b - undertook this reconstruction. If one did not know better, one would assume that Mozart had completed the work. The cadenza itself is highly inventive. Bobby, if you're reading, the Australian Knappertsbusch Association has reduced the dollar figure on your Wanted Poster from ten to five bucks and a couple of Mars Bars.

Ingo Goritzki, the soloist, has a beautiful reedy tone. I invariably find Polish ensembles to be musical to their bootstraps: the Polish Chamber Philharmonic is no exception. To fill out the program, the Flute Concerto (K 313) & the Andante for the same instrument (K 315) are transcribed for oboe and successfully so. When added to K 314, this is a generous program, stylishy and vivaciously played. The Claves recording is excellent.

This is a winner.",1

"not a professional job This is a notably poor disc (which I did not acquire at Amazon). My copy is going right to the used-CD market, where maybe a listener less exacting than I will get some pleasure from it. From the first seconds, I was irritated. Jacques Parrenin, the violinist and leader of this ensemble, was associated a while ago with some decent recordings of Faure's chamber music. It seems he hasn't recorded anything else besides this Lalo, and it seems like justice. I now have terrific recordings of Lalo's first and third trios (by the Caecilian and Jean Martin trios)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/French-Trios-Quartets-Debussy-Lalo-Faure-Ravel-Saint-Saens/dp/B000001K6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">French Trios & Quartets: Debussy, Lalo, Faure, Ravel, Saint-Saens</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lalo-Sonate-Op-12-Et-Trio-Op-26/dp/B0000AKOI7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lalo: Sonate Op. 12 Et Trio Op. 26</a>, so now the Parrenin goes back to the universe, where perhaps it will find a home more receptive than mine. As with all great music, and Lalo's trios are firmly in that category, one shouldn't waste time with sophomoric renderings. Traffic to this selection doesn't seem to be too intense, but whoever glances here should just keep on going.",0
"What a disappointment! I had so looked forward to having a ... What a disappointment!  I had so looked forward to having a clean version of the 1955 recording, and I thought that it would be worth the $32 splurge.  But this record, although it looks like the original Columbia 6 eye, sure doesn't sound like it.  It is mushy and lacks definition, just not right, just not beautiful.  I tried three different cartridges and 4 different styli.  I played it against the cassette I made 45 years ago from a friend's 1955 record; the cassette was noisy but far superior (and it was made with a mediocre turntable cartridge and stylus and a cheap cassette player).  I played it against the CD from A State of Wonder, that I never liked much; the CD was also far superior.  I don't know what they did wrong is engineering this record, but do not be deceived into thinking that it accurately portrays the 1955 recording.  It is in fact the worst version of the 1955 recording that I have heard.",0

"Not by The Shadows???? When I first heard this instrumental in my teens, I thought it was a new release by my favorites, The Shadows. A cousin who was the lead guitarist of an instrumental band and who played the tune note for note told me that it was by another English band called The Fentones. After getting the 45, I tried hard to learn how to play it but didn't nail the chorus until I can slow it down with my Vox JamVox four decades later! Always been a lousy guitar player, anyway! But I love this tune and always enjoy myself listening to it. I just wish it was recorded in stereo and that would have been great. It was released as a single in my country with ""Lover's Guitar"" on the B side. This tune was in turn covered and released as a single in a much, much better version that the original sounded amateurish. I've always wondered if the songwriter(Elleen Davies)ever heard this version. She would have been delighted as legions of Filipino players made the recording the standard of their guitar playing capabilities. The band that released that recording will forever be recognized as one of the best Filipino rock bands ever, if not the best. They were The Electromaniacs, led by Mr. Ernie Delgado who is widely looked up to as the best Filipino guitar player of his generation.

"Live Show First Ummmm...wow. I saw this guy live in a rainstorm at the Mighty Mississippi Music Festival in Greenwood MS. The rain was coming down, the wind was coming up, and they had already shutdown the North Mississippi Allstars show at the Main stage because of the weather.

We're on a way back to our tent to ride the storm out...and in the distance, on the blues stage, this guy is just rippin' it up...soaked already, we take the detour...<lightening overhead>...

It is just us and about 25 other drenched fools and this band...this bass player, dancing like it is the end of days as he plays, a stern drummer keepin' it together and a keyboard player who knows his role and excels at it. Jarekus tapping his foot in a rain puddle on the stage next to a 4-socket extension cord. Rain steams off of his body in the heat of the stage lights. <lightening overhead>

This CD is great despite the shortcomings of the mix. Reflects the rise of the New Urban Blues (as I call it) also in view in Gary Clark Jr. and Eric Gales, and puts Jarekus Singleton squarely in that company of fine new blues talent.

Our live show had no horn section and Jarekus carried the show in an impressive electric fashion. A fine player, song writer, singer, and someone to expect great things of in the future. <crash of thunder>

"""Sahara Rain"" take their melodic hard rock to the next level! Swiss melodic hard rock band ""Sahara Rain"" return in 2011 with their brand new second album ""Eternity"". The line up once again features lead singer Ricci Domenico, guitarist David Silhanek and Adrian Honegger, bassist Boet Haas and key-player Bo Rebsamen.

In comparison to its predecessor, ""Eternity"" retains the hard rock edge of the debut album while taking a considerable AOR turn. While their debut ""Sand in your hands"" drew upon German melodic hard rock, the new album comes close to the sound of Swiss melodic pioneers ""Gotthard"". For that matter, the production of the album as well as Ricci's vocals are the main points of reference for ""Gotthard""s influence on their sound; in fact, ""Sahara rain"" will definitely bring ""Gotthard"" to the experienced fan's mind once they play ""Eternity"".

Focusing onto the performances, it has to be said that `Sahara Rain's style had become substantially sophisticated; Yes, you once again get the thick riffs, the melodic guitar lines, the flawless rhythm section, and the harmonious shredding, only this time adding more keyboards into the mix. In fact, most songs are supported by piano that contributed both melodies and rhythm parts, becoming a large part of ""Sahara Rain""s sound. Songs like ""Shout it out"", ""Miss you"", ""Will I ever be"", ""Live Earth"" and ""Starlight"" uncover the musical class of ""Sahara Rain"" hence making perfectly clear that the group have effectively raised their game with this second effort.

Having played the album a good number of times, I would go as far as saying that ""Sahara Rain"" are creatively in the same league as ""Gotthard"" on account of the music found on this second effort ""Eternity"". For fans of the Swiss/German/Danish hard rock scene, ""Sahara Rain-Eternity"" is one of the best albums out there, at them moment.",1

"LOL, no! The biggest problem with a song like Nuestra is that it doesn't offer anything new or inventive to the table.  It is a tired and repetitive rock beat that continues to escalate into nothing special with some chanting and then it goes back to the same redundancy of the musicality, which is seriously lacking in depth and talent.  Now the actual album has gotten a few short raves from reviewers who happen to think this is a great album.  Maybe the album is better, but judging from this one song, I wouldn't give the album the time of day.  I'm certainly not impressed by this groups bottom feeding.

Four Stars good tun,1
Ugh The intro with the cheesy rhymes is so bad the song just never recovers.  I guess they can't all be good.,0

disappointed The Motivation single never downloaded. So I was not pleased. Money wasted. The song sounds good on the radio.  I will have to stick with itunes or purchase cd.,0

Five Stars The most beautiful music to totally fall in love with Jesus all over again....Highly recommended...,1
Too much taken from lyrics Change in the song made it not a very good listen nor dance matraial.,0
"Nah Most remixes enhance the original song. Not this one. Atleast not for me. Downloaded without seriously checking it out. I went under the ""I really like this artist"" assumption, plus when a girl plays this song to you in the bedroom for the first time, it leaves an impression.",0
AWFUL remix! I thought this remix was the one with lil wayne but they all have lil wayne. Buy the original one. This remix sounds like your speakers are going out part way through. It's terrible!,0
"Dishonest motivations An insipid attempt to not only promote the field she works in but also to exploit it to further her singing career. The lyrics could be read as a Hallmark thank you card. The promotional photos of her pretending to actually be in the mines, all dirty and proclaiming that coal mining is a ""dirty business,"" and the sexily clad ""coal turns me on"" tee shirts further warrant discrepancies in her integrity and hypocrisy as she is only an accountant for a coal mining company. I question  how genuine her motives are in this disappointing avenue..",0
"This Looks like a great album This Looks like a great album, but I would not really know because every time I try to down an MP3 from Amazon there is always a problem.

ZOEGirl rules!!! I have no words for this song but these: LOVE IT!!!!!,1

Great song as we all know but the original is ... Great song as we all know but the original is many stars better and the vocal cords are just not hitting the notes in this live version,0
"Empty, plodding, and tiresome I have tried and tried with this album, due to so many positive words written about it in so many places.  But there really seems to be nothing here.  Grooveless monotony, awash in reverb and bong gurgles.  There is no funk to this dub, no rock to this pseudo-psychedelic haze.  This has been a real endurance test for me to listen to, and I'm finally giving up.",0
"Passable It contains his signature hit ""I Love"" and was the debut album for the song, but like Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"" album, the rest of the songs on it are mere album fillers and never made it off this album that I know of. If you like the ""I Love"" song, buy his compilation albums instead, unless you like collectors items and nostalgia.",0
"missing tracks There are 9 symphonies at 4 movements each, that should make 36 tracks, yet there are only 34 tracks. This compilation is missing the 4th movement of both the 5th and 6th symphonies. Why would anyone buy and incomplete collection?",0

waste of time This mp3 is not the original songs it is covers. This seller is not promoting the right product no where does it say that these songs are remixes or remakes. FYI LISTEN TO THE SONGS BEFORE YOU BU!!!,0
"WOW really? Seeing as it says HIP HOP and the first song is by Black eyed Peas, it should have been a clue that this album was going to suck. Well, I was right. It DOES suck. And worse of all, it's a bunch of remade songs by some random people. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.",0
"DO NOT BUY This albumn is not done by the actual artists, it's a recreation by another group.  They don't sounds anywhere near the actual musicians. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!",0
Not the real artists... This album sucks. All of the songs are re-recorded because whoever put it together was too cheap to buy the songs from the real artists. Do not buy it is a waste of money.,0

Four Stars It'a good and inspiring work.,1
"Good clean fun I heard Isaac Air Freight back in the late 70's or early 80's and I thought, not only are they funny, but it's something I can share with anyone, because their material is clean and wholesome. This, unfortunately, is not always the case with other music and/or comedy media. Thank God for Christian entertainers who care about providing family entertainment. This was funny then, and funny now.",1

"my favorite is ""Call Me"" I had the privilege of seeing him perform in NYC, years ago, the headliner was Dave Koz. I had never heard of Phil before then, but doubts turned to Praise once he opened his mouth. What a voice, my favorite is ""Call Me"", and you also will love his version of ""By the type I get to Phoenix"".

Love you Phil.",1
"Wonderful Inspired by the folk song ""Maid in Bedlam"" this is a beautiful movement in Holst 2nd Suite in F major.  Gorgeous performance.",1
Fun in the Son Ha! what a hoot! and oldie but goodie for Christian comedy. you can take scripts out of this CD and use for youth group skits. it is fun with the Son. :),1
"Should be an EP There are only like 4 actual songs on this album and 10 interludes/skits.  Most of the skits are seemingly random movie quotes.  I don't know if he is going for a pseudo Jay Electronica thing with the movie quotes, but for such a talented rapper he is way off base with this CD which features him rapping for maybe a combined 10 minutes.  I would recommend buying Blu & Exile's 'Beneath the Heavens' which is one of the best underground CDs ever and paying 99 cents for the track Amnesia on iTunes.",0
"Beautiful sound Great music for gathering, reading your bible or just pure enjoyment. This is jazz that glorifies the Lord with every single measure!",1

"It is my go to feel good theme song My mom bought me the ""Doc Hollywood"" sountrack years ago because that is where I first heard this song but it wasn't on the soundtrack. I was very excited to find it on Amazon. It is my go to feel good theme song.",1
"Fun This song is fun, a classic early '90s song. Nothing deep about it, and it's pretty self-centered. It may be annoyingly catchy. The sound quality is not particularly high, but it is over twenty years old. It'd be a great song for a '90s party--even if you didn't know the song then, you'll instantly recognize the time period influence.",1

"One of the Best Jazz Fusion Albums of the Decade If you're looking for great music, look no further. Sylvan Street is one of the up-and-coming bands in the world of jazz fusion and they've gotten to that place for a reason. This music is hot and the fast songs really make you want to swing. Featuring incredible soloists on nearly every track, Here in America is the perfect album for anyone looking to enjoy the future of jazz fusion.",1
"Great EP This is a fantastic ep, I've listened to it through about 10 times already. I can't wait to hear more from this awesome new band!",1
Not It Not worth the price: this digital download was free! I'd like to smash the person who chose to advertise this track.,0
"Awesome Sound Enjoying this cd purchased, and surprised of the low price. This is far the best LoneStar cd vocally that i have purchased.  Great Cd but wish there were more songs to hear.",1
"Not what you would expect... This compilation is some of Lonestar's best songs, but the lead singer on these versions of the music is not Richie McDonald, whose voice made these hits what they are. While I appreciate the low price point on the album, I wouldn't recommend it for a true fan of Lonestar's music.",0
I am sure the receiver liked it ( Bought as a gift...  I am sure the receiver liked it (?),0
"El Shaddai Love this song! What a beautiful soft & gentle praise & worship song, very good to play with prayer & bible study.",1
Best Song of Album-Pure Rock In my opinion this is the best song of the Album.  It is very upbeat & reminds me of Vertigo from U2.  I only hope this song is released as a single/it has the potential to top the charts.  It is a very different sound for Mana and It could be played in night clubs as it has a dance beat to it.  This song takes the pop out of Mana and will stay in your mind while making u sing it over and over.  Gracias Mana por esta cancion.,1
"Meh Dear Mana,
  In the unlikely event that you read this review, in English, I beg of you to please return to your old style of music. This new ""stuff"" is decent at best.

"This song is one of the most beautiful. While listening to this excellent example I am fond of Scottish song and Jean Redpath's singing.  This song is one of the most beautiful. While listening to this excellent example, I finally learned to sing it as I would wish to do whenever hearing it in the past.  It no longer haunts me, and I can enjoy it anytime I feel like singing.  It has thusly become for me now a happy ending -- and for a wee $1.05.  MADE M' DAY!",1

For this 1965 LP, sung entirely in Nabors nasal Gomer Pyle voice, his singing and comedy came together. With songs written by the legendary Billy Edd Wheeler, John Loudermilk and Roger Miller, the material is several cuts above the typical TV star cash-in, and with Nabors twin talents as a vocalist and comedian, the results are funny, entertaining and endearing. Like any comedy album, its not likely to get spun as frequently as a straight music album, but youll be surprised at how quickly youll be singing along, and if you have kids, they may just love the tongue-twisting Hoo How, What Now? and the corny rock n roll of Heart Insurance. [2017 Hyperbolium]",1
kenny rogers number ones Boy was I surprised when I started playing this and it turned out to be trace adkins what a surprise,0
"Gomer Pyle Sings Here is Jim Nabors singing in the  character of Gomer Pyle. Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. was one of the first shows I watched as a child. Many shows just lose their appeal as one grows older. This is one of the rare shows that is still entertaining now, as it was 40 plus years ago. Thats the sign of an excellent show. This album was advertised on the back of the record envelope of an early Nabors album originally issued in 1966. Hilarious music and highly reccomended",1
One Star not many songs on it that I like,0
Five Stars Excellent experience,1
"Bluegrass gospel favorite I had initially purchased this CD solely for the song ""Across the Miles"" that I had heard on Pandora radio. After listening to CD in its entirety, I fell in love with the way the voices blend and mesh in the good ole gospel tradition. As a HUGE fan of bluegrass music and its history, and this CD has quickly become a favorite in my collection. I will look for more CDs by Russell Moore and iird Tyme Out.",1
Classic Song with Good Memories Classic song by Tanya Tucker. Was very popular in the 1970s. Worth a listen and maybe add to the collection.,1
"Another amazing song from this soulful band I fell in love with a few songs from this band on Youtube, so i bought their first full length album, ""Ode to Sunshine"" which has become one of my favorite albums of all time. (On the short list with a few albums from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, Foo Fighters,  etc).  Delta Spirit is both  old-school and new school: While they don't seem to be virtuosos on their instruments, the music they put together is unique and hits you right in the heart",1
"Not the same Lamb This is not the same Lamb (Andrew Barlow and Lou Rhodes out of Manchester England) of the hit Gabriel, Gorecki and Cottonwool.
Though disappointed and feeling foolish that I didn't know this was not from the duo (I thought there were industry rules that prevented bands using the same same with the same exact spelling); the music is good and I will give it a second or more listen",0
"Club ready banger. I love this song, it has a great club beat, but its the beat that is also the songs greatest flaws, its showcases how thin and kind of high his voice is, especially when compared to his sister, Brandy's. He still good but at times he struggles to be heard over the music especially since the uncredited background dancehall singer can be heard clearly. I think if a R&B version of this song with just Ray J would be better. But despite its flaws or maybe because of them I still think its a really good song and lets be honest on most club songs, the vocals aren't the main focus, and to this the song serves it purpose quite well.",1
Five Stars Love it! :D,1
"!!!! never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-

had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!

close to $100 worth of music never received!!",0

"Skrillex and Mortal Kombat!!! I was skeptical of the almighty and great Skrillex making a song for a video game but after Wreck it Ralph and Bug Hunt the man can produced for an adult movie and probably make it sound good lol!!

"NOT Don Dorsey. Disco beat to weak, almost 8-bit, midi synthesizer. Hi - you could do better downloading the midi files of these inventions and just playing those on your computer.
This album takes these inventions and plays them on some weak midi program, with a disco beat backing. So, it is like ""Hooked on Classics."" Except not even as good. The sound is almost ""8bit,"" the sound that comes out of pccket video games.

They use the name ""Bachbuster,"" but do not get confused with Don Dorsey's awesome Bach-on-synth album, ""Bachbusters."" That is awesome. Dorsey throws a backing beat in there at a point or two, but his whole album is not ""Hooked On..."" Dorsey was or is an electronic music composer and arranger for Disney, and got really good  at electronic music scoring and production. So, he went and put out his own album, Bachbusters. He has probably been te only artist since Wendy Carlos and Isao Tomita to get broad attention for an album of classical music played on synthesizers. I think Bachbusters may have won a grammy. Dorsey had 2 more, as far as I know - 1 with Beethoven, and one a melange.

So, if you are gonna spend the money, I would say get Dorsey vs. this 8bit Hooked-On-Bach. But, for a lark, or who knows - exercise music? - you might want to try this album.",0

"Bootleg unauthorized release. Poor packaging and sound quality. These recordings are available legitimately. No point in this. ""Mason Records"", the label on this release, is a bootleg label. Quoting from Discogs: ""BOOTLEGS Cd reissues label. Please list the CDs as Unofficial releases. This label name is plain fantasy, there is no company behind them. Information ""Made in Geramany"", ""Digitally remastered"", Barcodes are plain tricks or gimmicks.""

The packaging on this release is poor, as is the sound quality.

In other words, if you buy this, you're buying someone's low grade attempt to copy music from legitimate releases and sell it as their own. The source of the recordings is questionable, and not a penny goes to the artists, or their label.

Since both of the recordings on this release are available, legitimately, as reissues on Collectors Choice Records, see:

"They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier Ive been a fan of Mist of Avalon since 1998 after I accidentally stumbled over the song Lost In Feelings on their self-titled Mist of Avalon CD. They had a haunting distinctive sound with influences from The Sisters of Mercy and slight touches of the Ramones here and there. I live in the USA and at that time their music wasn't available in the States so I contacted them in the year 2000 and Erik Sjlander, the guitarist, contacted me immediately. He helped me out big time, thank you Erik, and I ordered the 3 CDs they had out at the time (Mist of Avalon, Sleepless, and Here And After). In 2001 they released the CD titled Tears. It is after this that things in the band changed drastically. It wasn't until 2007 that another CD was put out titled The Mist of Avalon Limited. They no longer sounded like they did back in 2001 and earlier. Instead of the haunting vibe they morphed into a euro-pop rock sound.

The Dinya CD released in 2010 has all of the songs from The Mist of Avalon Limited CD plus 6 more songs. The CD isn't bad, but the sound is so different from their previous work I personally feel they shouldnt have used the Mist of Avalon band name when they released these last two CDs. The best song on the Dinya CD is Negri. That is the only song I like on this CD, whereas on all the previous CDs from 1998 to 2001 I like all of the songs. I attempted to contact Aram Yildiz the singer, but he did not respond. Im guessing he no longer looks at their Mist of Avalon web page anymore and has moved on to other musical interests.

In any case Dinya is a good CD if you're looking for a Euro-pop rock vibe, but if you're looking for the classic Mist of Avalon sound Id pass.",0

"Not Technomind's Standard I love Technomind's stuff, but this one sounds crude and disjointed. Maybe it's supposed to, but it distracts me. I'd highly recommend their ""Flow State"" album instead of this one. It is excellent.",0
"Strangely works... Oddly, it does work. However, I can't listen to it for long stretches of time. I'm an author, so sometimes, what I need is noise that isn't entirely music, but I need something to drown out the ever barking dog three apartment buildings down. You know? The pulsing beat? It takes a second to get used to, but if I cut it off too soon, my brain says, ""WHAT?! Turn that back on!""

The writing doesn't happen right away. It takes about a minute, but then? Get out of the way. The keyboard is on fire!

Interesting...and odd.",1
Worked fabulous The music is good. I used this for background in a video. It would also work really well for fighting or adventuring music for table top RPGs.,1

I love Saul, and I thought his first album was the strongest, next I thought the trent reznor's collab album was rocking as well.  But this?  what the hell is this?  A bunch of pop - poppycock. Wake up. Get back to your rootz.  Revolution of the mind.",0
I love it. This single is a very good single. I love it.,1
"too pricey love this song, but very expensive for a single! I anticipated more than just the radio edit and acoustic version of one single. This is NOT an entire CD, so do not buy if that is what you are looking for!",0
SUCKS!!! I really did NOT enjoy the way this man sounds. This guy sounds awful! I would not recommend buying this crap!,0
"Delightful and upbeat! This is a great collection of Celtic songs with plenty of upbeat, toe-tapping tunes. When my daughter heard it, she said it made her want to get up and dance a jig! Perfect for lowering your blood pressure and facilitating the release of endorphins. And better than coffee to wake you up in the morning. I wish they had liner notes, though. Maybe they have liner notes on the CD version but I bought the MP3 download and it didn't include any notes about the songs or the performers.",1
Such a great band This is a traditional Irish music band. They have solid sounds and the voices are deep and melodious. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Irish music! Let your self be entertained and soothed.,1
"Small Town Girl by Kimmie Rhodes Small Town Girl by Kimmie Rhodes is about as bad a CD one can buy.  On any given CD, I can find at least one song, which makes the CD worth purchasing.  That is not the case with ""small Town Girl""  - - this album does not do Kimmie Rhodes justice and detracts from her other fine albums.  Don't buy - save your money.

"Not the best selection I don't like the music, and the beat isn't consistent",0
"The acoustics are awful. The CD is awful.  Some songs are very loud; some are soft; you can tell it was copied from other CD's.  After about the fourth song there's a terrible screech in it, as if, in the past when we had records, someone pushed the needle on the record.  I'm afraid it's going to break my stereo; listened to it twice and I will throw it away.",0
"I Love Rock and Roll was sung by a man to ... Threw it in the trash.  The songs were barely recognizable.

FAKE The pictures lead you to believe that these tracks are from original artists.  Please do not be fooled and waste your money.  The original versions are much better and full of life.  These are boring and horrible vocals.  I sampled 3 tracks just to make sure.  FAKE FAKE FAKE.  I am a collector of remixes and original mixes of 80's music and can tell right away.,0
Awesome I've always liked Trick Pony and was disappointed when the group split up.  She has such a clear vocal and it really shows up in this song!  Its beautiful and reminds me of what love should be.,1

great compilation A good sampling of Brel's career and a real bargain!  The audio quality on most of the tracks is good although a few of the (earlier?) recordings are muddy.  Well worth it.,1

"Wow This is part of the Impulse 'New Wave' series issued in the sixties to showcase the new world of jazz post-big band. It was one of 4 albums I needed to fill out my set of A-1 through A-100 (A-41). As usual, Paul Gonsalves does not disappoint. Cleo definately has the groove and loved it. He is one of the giants from his work with Ellington (Wow, those who know remember ""Live at Newport', his collaborations with Sonny Stitt and sooooo much more. Definately a keeper.",1
Five Stars Beautiful  song,1
"SHERI MILLER IS ALL IN on ""WINNING HAND"" I've watched this talented singer, songwriter, guitarist/pianist blossom over the past few years, from ingnue to troubadour to exciting, mature artist. ""Winning Hand,"" Sheri Miller's new CD, packs an emotional wallop to go along with its tuneful, impeccably produced music. I liken Sheri to my favorite female singer/songwriter, Karla Bonoff, in her fearless ability to range from the precincts of despair (""Guarded, so brokenhearted/I kept the world at bay"") to the pinnacle of joy (""Love, Love, Love, Love""). It isn't easy to channel your inner self this forthrightly, and this nakedness adds depth to ""Winning Hand's"" hit-potential pop-rock (""Spoons,"" ""Everybody Feels This Way Sometimes""). With this lovely, assured CD, Sheri Miller is pushing all her chips in on the river card. I wouldn't bet against her, if I were you!",1
"Great beat, very catchy This is a great, catchy song, that came from a popular YouTube video.  It's a Miley Cyrus take-off (pre-twerking, but very much post-Disney Miley) that also used video footage from Snoop Dogg (pre-Snoop Lion, I think).  The lyrics are less interesting than some of BLR's other work, but otherwise very much inline with what BLR usually does:  goofy, crass, but catchy.  However, the beat is one of BLR's best and the weird impression of Snoop is pretty great in its own way.

If you're not familiar with Bad Lip Readings (""BLR""), the idea is that the author, who can read lips, used to joke with friends that people looked like they were saying ridiculous things if you were only mediocre at reading lips (or if you were joking around and trying to misread what they were actually saying).

The BLR author took that concept and ran with it, making various political, movie, and music videos where he used actual footage from politicians, movie scenes, and music videos.  For music videos, the BLR author would also make a new musical track and do his own impressions of the artist (or maybe he has friends do the impressions, I don't know).  However, in place of the real words of the song, the BLR author added goofy words that either made little to no sense but were amusing (like this song's lyric ""Tiny Timmy Tokyo"" or the song ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn"") or were otherwise just ridiculous (like the line ""Let's buy two industrial windmills"" from this song, or ""You slapped a fiiiiish"" from a Twilight BLR).  The BLR replacement words are generally very entertaining, and the impressions sound pretty good but still have their own interesting style.

However, a funny thing happened when he was making the goofy music videos:  they turned out to be really good songs on their own.  The beats are impressive, the tunes are fun, and the tracks overall are very catchy.  So while you would probably be fairly confused if you heard this song without knowing what it was, you might still find yourself singing it later.

I highly recommend BLR's songs to others.  They're fun, catchy, and worth a listen.  I can only hope that, like Weird Al's stuff, BLR can work with authors and create more great BLR music videos.  (At least some artists, like Michael Bubl, think what he did with their songs is hiliariousBubl has a YouTube response praising the BLR ""Shoot a Russian Unicorn."")",1
"Very good music.  I play it all the time. This is a great album.  I play it in the car, and at night, really I listen to this a lot.  My kids seem to relax and trip out on the many amazing tin whistle melodies.  I'm not an expert in Irish music, but to me this sounds like a cool fusion of Irish music with a sort of modern flare that makes me actually stay awake and become energetic.  Some of my other tin whistle music makes me snooze.  I highly recommend this album!",1

"So good, I bought it twice. I enjoyed this album so much that I bought it again off Jim's band camp. It feels oldschool, but new at the same time. The game that wasn't a game that this music plays in fits perfectly. The colors and setting are completely in sync with what you are hearing. You don't even need to have played the game in order to enjoy this album.",1
"Our Gang Gang Like so many offbeat or experimental bands, each successive release by Gang Gang Dance finds them sporting a progressively accessible sound. ""Eye Contact,"" GGD's fourth proper album, is not only accessible, it's ""pleasant."" Compared to their past work--even immediate predecessor ""Saint Dymphna""--this is practically Easy Listening music for them; spacey synths undulating through leanly arranged melodic numbers, each track flowing perfectly into the next as if it were a Paul Oakenfold mix.

Is this cause for panic amongst the GGD fan base? Hopefully not. While this one certainly is as smooth as a whale's tail, the spacey feel is closer to Cocteau Twins than Enya or Moby. And it's still inimitably, unabashedly, a Gang Gang Dance creation. As with past albums, percussion still takes precedence here, so ""Eye Contact"" is not some dippy trance mix; it has some great rhythms, from the crashing dubstep of ""MindKilla"" to the skittering ""Sacer"" to the thunderous stomp of ""Thru and Thru."" And Lizzie Bougastos is as colorful a vocalist as ever, turning ""Adult Goth"" into a stoner-friendly Bollywood anthem. That may sound silly, but the song's beauty and emotional heft totally transcend any campy trappings such a reference might hold. Such is the power of Gang Gang Dance.

The seamless synthetic approach to the album's production does give ""Eye Contact"" a deceptive feeling of sameness, not to mention of fluffy superficiality. Subsequent listens, however, reveal the character behind each song. Admittedly, I was initially underwhelmed, but now I can't get enough. Similar to Stereolab's ""Dot and Loops,"" an impressive and ambitious album eventually comes out of hiding. Just give it a chance, let it get to know you.",1

"Stunning! As a fan of Studio Ghibli and also of face meltng Heavy Metal even i didn't dare to hope this tribute would be as good as it is. But this is quite simply one of the best metal records for ages.

Thundering percussion, screaming power metal riffage and soaring solos meld the Ghibli tracks into an altogether unforgettable modern metal experience. They lose none of their melody and even keep a great deal of their original charm, helped in no small part by the dual male/female vocal combination. The male vocals are low and gutteral but perfectly listenable, we're not talking nu-metal or screamo and the female vocals, lead on most tracks, are still very sweet, girlish and deliciously kawaii ^^ , riding beautifully over the metal roar.

And what a roar it is, prime power metal straight from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonforce/dp/B000FKO5DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonforce</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helloween/dp/B001EKH094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helloween</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Japan/dp/B000RZGFIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Japan</a>&nbsp;school of rock.

There are so many highlights it really is a moot point! And it's wonderfully produced, too, not a hint of evil compression or digital clipping. You can turn this up to 11 and still enjoy!

It is, of course, sung almost entirely in Japanese but that should not put you off. You'll be missing out on an absolute joy!",1

"Oh how I wish this was reissued on cd My vinyl copy of this album hasn't stood up to the ravages of time very well and I have been hoping for a cd reissue since cd's first hit the market.  This is a program of pop material that stands apart from this great singer's usual repertoire. It's all good, but her rendition of the Stones' ""No Expectations"" is better than good, it's magnificent and deserves to be preserved and remembered.",1
"KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BUYING! There's nothing here that isn't freely available on other sites. Someone basically downloaded a bunch of MIDI files off the internet, played them on his computer and captured the audio, and is passing it off as an album.

If you enjoy this, and feel it's worth your money, all the power to you, but I think it's only fair that you know what you're buying: An album that is NOT PLAYED BY AN ARTIST, but rather generated on someone's computer, using low-end equipment.

I could understand if they at least bothered to use a decent synthesizer or sound font...

OK, I'll stop my rant there, but sifting through ""albums"" like this one is a real annoyance for those of use who are looking for actual music, played on a real piano and recorded with at least half decent equipment!",0
"Horrible MIDI junk. Stay away! Now that most ""ragtime era"" compositions are in the public domain, MIDI files of ragtime pieces are widely available all over the internet. Clearly, all the producers of this MP3 set did was nab a few, convert them to MP3, and post them for sale here. They didn't even bother to render the MIDIs in a half-decent soundfont! All you get here are monotonous, rigid computer renditions of the rags in a cheesy synthesized piano sound. Yuck! Who cares if it's cheap? The non-copyrighted source MIDI files are free and widely available. (Just use your search engine.) I love ragtime, and but rather than waste your money on this junk, look for CDs or MP3s of *real* performances by *real* human musicians: Max Morath, Joshua Rifkin, John Arpin, Guido Nielsen, Richard Dowling, Morten Gunnar Larsen, Trebor Tichenor, etc. There are plenty of talented musicians playing this music with much more feeling and passion. For decent performances you might not get 50 tracks for such a cheap price as this compilation, but you're much better off getting a dozen or two dozen really good performances than 50 lousy ones. Skip this garbage.",0
"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Bronwynne Brent - Deep Black Water (Independent)
New Orleans singer-songwriter Bronwynne Brent recorded her debut in Austin, Tx. with Mike McCarthy producing and a stellar band, including David Grissom on guitar and The Faces' Ian McLagan on Hammond B-3.  That's a heavyweight cast for an artist recording a debut album, but their judgement was good, and ""Deep Black Water"" is a super album of gothic Americana and indie folk songs. The title track is sheer perfection, but it's not alone. ""Like The Thunder"" is just beautiful, a haunting pedal steel guitar snakes around Brent's words, and ""Tell Be Sweet"" is a devastating love song. Fans of Jesse Sykes and Joanna Newsom should hunt a copy down.",1

"40's Style Songs, Some Live Tracks, Not-so-good Quality CD was made in Holland in 2000.  It is said to be by original artists, which it seems to be.

I generally look for good quality original hits by the original artists.  I shy away from re-recorded or live versions, and I usually don't seek album tunes that weren't individual hits. Remastered original hits are ok if the remastering was done well.

Here are some quick observations that I made on the individual tracks of this CD.

1. Granada - Frankie Laine : Appears to be a re-record based on comparison to tracks available from iTunes. Quality is good with a couple glitches.
2. Love Letters - Perry Como: A live version with front end conversation.
3. Blue Skies - Dick Haymes: A nice version but not a hit by Haymes.
4. Swanee - Al Jolson: a good track, but I'm not sure if it is original.
5. Send My Baby Back to Me - Jimmy Durante: A live version with clapping.
6. My Heart is Taking Lessons - Bing Crosby: A good track, but not a tune I wanted.
7. Mona Lisa - Nat King Cole: A live version.  Not bad quality.
8. Cry - Johnny Ray: A live version with clapping.
9. Life Is a Song - Tony Bennett: Generally good quality; not sure if it's live.
10. In the Still of the Night - Nelson Eddy: A live version with clapping.
11. A Foggy Day - Fred Astaire: Nice version, a wee bit grainy sound.
12. Stardust - Louis Prima: Very poor quality. Hashy.
13. Song of Songs - Perry Como: Live recording with clapping.
14. The Touch of Your Lips - Bing Crosby: Pretty good quality.
15. Young at Heart - Jimmy Durante: So so quality. Talking introduction.",0
Five Stars Good music,1
Unenjoyable I listened to this once and haven't gone back. I don't know what happened to Brandon's voice but he went from purring to whining. I'm glad I got this single for free so I knew not to waste my money on the whole album.,0
"The days of Fungus Amongus and SCIENCE are long gone. This... is garbage. Sure, it's listenable, but Incubus has grown into a band that's far from what they founded themselves on. Ever since their bassist left the band it has just been a disaster. I was foolish enough to buy Crow Left of Murder, but I won't be fooled again.

Seriously, check out some other bands. Don't buy into this crap anymore. I know, you'll be tempted, but Mutemath's album is coming out soon. Check out some decent blues bands or something. Try something different. Don't support a band that puts out dull music that only sells because their band's name is on it.",0

"Adolescents?  Incubus knew what good music was back then.... This new single had some promise and maybe I thought it was a slower picture of amazingness to come. How utterly wrong I was. I read some of the reviews around the internet and in many ways they're 100% correct. It's almost as if Incubus lost its way completely. Like someone got hit on the head, woke up famous and completely forgot how they got there. The new CD is laughable and nothing other than terrible and forgettable. After listening to the Foo Fighters new CD, I thought ""WOW! Bands can still make amazing music."" Which only made this situation that much worse. Adolescent is the only song on the entire album that anywhere near resembles Incubus. Where's the unique turn tables mixed against hard charging guitar? This CD sounds like something my Mom would listen to (shes in her late 50s). It's boring, ambiguous and nothing Incubus. People say ""well they've matured! Their sound is different."" There's a difference between maturing and changing who you are completely. Eminem has come into his own and ""matured"" his sound.....meaning he made it a better more confident rendition of who he is/was. He didn't turn to Opera and claim it's him ""maturing.""

There's no maturing to this album, if anything it's just a transition into a bad Coldplay/U2 ballad cover band. They took five years off and forgot who they were. Brandon lost his edge...the band lost it's edge......they're no longer unique in literally any way, shape or form. Before I was worried Incubus would make a bad album.....now I'm concerned Incubus has just become a terrible band.",0

Bands evolve, and their fan-base should at least give new material a fair shake. 'Adolescents' isn't quite representative of most of their latest album and I found it to be one of the better tracks. The uncomplicated lyrics stand out and the instrumentation is quite good.

"Dreadfully amateurish and BADLY read in a rushed manner from a script, VERY robotic. Very unprofessional, amateurish. She sounds like a BAD actress reading BADLY from a bad script. There is no calm flow here as with most hypnosis recordings or guided meditations. I've heard better reading from grade school kids.
She can't even keep the flow of words going from the end of a line on the page into the one below it, automatically making it sound as if the next line on the page is an entirely new sentence instead of a continuation of the previous one. VERY robotic and rushed.
She must say ""You are feeling more and more relaxed"" 100 times instead of switching up the ""commands"".
And who the hell counts down ""Number Ten"" ""Number Nine"", ""Number 8""......  ????????",0

"Miserable When it has came down to Glee, they've done some really bad covers since they've begun the T.V. last season. But what really has made it clear to me, is that when the cast does a cover song, it feels like they've taken the magic out of great songs that've been strong for others, and turned them into disgraces. That is the case with Misery, their latest song from Glee. Taking the upbeat delight from Maroon 5, and not really making it their own, hasn't been anything new to my ears. If you really want to be put out of misery, stick with the one from Maroon 5 instead. Adam Levine has a better drive with his music, than Glee does in a single note on the music scale.

"Missing The Best Song How come every time I look for this product it's always missing ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" from the tracks? That was my favorite song from this album! Until it is added it won't be a complete offering.",0
"Heavy, plush, dull-edged Diabellis Paul Lewis' Beethoven Diabelli Variations is the follow-up to Lewis' supremely acclaimed Beethoven sonata cycle. It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself. I own the sonata box set, and was disappointed with much of it. Here, I hoped for better from Lewis, but came away I am even more disappointed.

The Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon/obstacle courses in music, taxing and trying to performers and audiences alike, and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression. Sadly, I don't think Lewis fared well.

On both this recording and the sonata cycle, I hear from Lewis:

-Plushly upholstered, dull-edged Beethoven.
-A big, thick, dark, heavy piano sound, that you will either like or not. I don't care for it. Lewis piano tuning (on a Steinway) and technique add to the effect.
-An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects (and I think more pedal) than most, which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness.
-Dull-edged centrist/middle of the road interpretation and performance. Thoughtful to the point of being overthought, and at many times lost and meandering. Often boring. Better on lyrical and hushed passages, awkward on the rest. Lacking variety in character and expression.
-Soft, rounded off legato phrasing. This is my main issue with Lewis. He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music, far beyond what is called for. Edges are blunted, rounded, and smoothed over---no chiseling, no pinpoint articulation. Musical lines, dynamics, accenting, and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged (even when he is more forceful and aggressive).
- Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side, further accentuating thickness, fuzziness, and heaviness.

Some of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas, but this is not necessarily for the better. Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively. There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded, meandering in others, and some passages where he is just leaden. Midrange and mushy, and at worst, almost unctuous.

Im a fan of the approach that in theme and variations, the opening theme is usually something quaint, therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek, to set the stage. Or it must be done with flair and attitude. Lewis does neither. He starts by bullrushing through it, and with legato, charmlessly. And then promptly, starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit, he is dull and leaden (and legato), and pretty much stays there for dozens more.

I took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas, and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character, and here on the Diabellis, I hear much of the same again. Especially for this work, there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement, but it all sounds too alike. The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters. Things don't improve much as each variation passes by. More legato.

Lewis is better in the most hushed and quiet variations, but still manages to make these sound less than riveting. Most importantly, there is a lack of movement to movement connection---a point of view--- that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive, tricky work. At times, Lewis seems to go off on tangents, lost in the woods. There are dead spots, including in the all-important final variations, where poignancy is required.

It did not take me long to lose interest in this performance.

It reminded me of Andrei Vieru's version, which was also big and (too) legato-edged.

To be fair, there are many recordings of the Diabellis that, for various reasons, also fall short. It is tough work to pull off. Some interpreters, including big names, also have a bad legato habit. So Lewis' version has a lot of unfortunate company.

Compared to Lewis version, Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a huge breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief. Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference, so comparisons are inevitable. I hear far more fine detail, crispness, wit, depth and insight with Anderszewskis. Every variation is distinct and different, as they should be. More importantly, Anderszewski did a better job holding my attention through the entire work, while Lewis did not.

Besides Anderszewski, there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer, each with better energy, expressiveness and clarity. They include Filippo Gorini, Vladimir Feltsman, Ingrid Andsnes, Laurent Cabasso, Christian Leotta, Igor Levit, and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings, and also Richter, John O'Conor, and Alfred Brendel (Lewis' mentor), just to name a few others. I like William Kinderman's recording, and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture. Gorini, whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis' should have been, is also a Brendel student. (Let's see what happens to him from here.) Pier Paolo Vincenzi's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven's and the 51 other variations of other composers. So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis'.

Can I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone? If you like legato, a thick warm piano sound, and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven, Lewis might satisfy you.

For more jaded ears, who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven, you may, as I do, find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag.",0
"""old-school"" & stolid The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the better.",0

"United Together With Our Own Kind And Solve Our Problems How to understand Malcom X? Go to the source!
Each of these speeches needs to be heard and taken alone with enough time for contemplation. Why? Playing these one after another will only stoke anger. Contemplation of MalcomX's and knowing the timeframe he gave these speeches gives one a sense of hope: When Malcom X gave these early speeches Kennedy hadn't set forth the road that would lead to Johnson's Civil Rights Acts. There was no hope. Water fountains were segregated to white and 'colored'. Bathrooms as well. We don't have them (as much) now but department stores such as Woolworth (think Walgreens and Target) had cafes where no 'colored' people were allowed to sit & have a (Starbucks) coffee with a croissant. These were not gang members wearing bandanas of a certain color and having tattoos on their faces scaring little children ->served today with a smile. These were women who might have worked on the NASA program that launched John Glenn into space & they couldn't order let alone sit and drink a cup of coffee let alone have lunch at these department stores in the south. In the north, where Malcom X was in Harlem, it was more subtle - with rents for apartments and pricing differences. Those were the times. Malcom X was aligned with Elijah Mohammed of the Nation of Islam after serving time in jail. He freely admits he was not a good person. It was the Muslim religion that saved him (in the late 50's). When he got out of prison he became the spokesman for the Harlem unit while Elijah Mohammed was out in Los Angeles. Tensions came between them as Malcom X became the more quoted, more sought after face of the Nation of Islam by the Main stream media & when there was a shooting of a Nation of Islam follower by white police, Malcom X wanted escalation where Elijah Mohammed did nothing & According to the Smithsonian special ""The Lost Tapes - Malcom X"" 2018, this was the first crack in the relationship. In 1963 Elijah Mohammed does not want Malcom X involved with the civil rights movement. Too late. Its already happened. Next came the Kennedy assassination & Elijah Mohammed wanted nothing said. Malcom X was stopped by the press and asked about the shooting & whereas he said nothing about that he did speak to the press which got him a 90 day suspension from giving speeches. He tried to comply but again the press came and tried to confirm the 90 day suspension, Malcom X gave a glib answer and Elijiah Mohammed/Nation of Islam extended the 90 days to which Malcom X decided to leave for his turn at Mecca. While there, he noted that many white people were also Muslim & it changed his thinking so that he came back, split up with Elijah Mohammed, started his own foundation and finally reached out to Martin Luther King Jr. who he had previously pilloried relentlessly for being too soft on his Ghandi like approach. In the end, Nation of Islam had had enough and three of their followers shot him at the beginning of one of his speeches. He was rushed to the hospital where he died. If you want to hear his own thoughts (EARLY in his own development of what it means for the human condition as these were prior to his trip to Mecca and his full conversion to Sunni Muslim belief of inclusion) verbalized then this source is 100% optimal and can't be matched by text.",1

"Kevin Barnes has a beautiful mind, but this song was a little too dark and discordant for my tastes. This is the first track from Of Montreal's EP titled ""thecontrollersphere.""  It's a dark, heavy, haunting track, full of discordant noises and reverberating vocals.  It's kind of a departure from the rest of the album, which doesn't rely as much on dissonance.  Of course, this sort of song symbolizes why Of Montreal is so interesting in the first place.  If I ask you what kind of music you listen to, and you say, ""I really love Of Montreal,"" then I actually have no idea whether we have similar tastes in music.  Because while I didn't really enjoy this song, I would be happy to listen to ""Requiem for O.M.M. 2"" on every significant road trip I take for the rest of my life.

My review here is intended to reflect my opinion, but I hope this won't dissuade you from at least giving this track a try.  And if you try it and don't love it, then please don't let that dissuade you from listening to some other songs in Of Montreal's body of work (some of their more popular tracks include ""Fugitive Air,"" ""Gronlandic Edit,"" and ""Wrath Pinned to the Mist and Other Games"").",0
"Huge fan of Kevin Barnes, not so much of the EPs To say of Montreal is my favorite band is a gross understatement. Their music can be passionately exciting and transcendent. It wasn't always this way--their early albums, apart from Cherry Peel, are just exercises in absurdity--but Kevin Barnes' creativity and talent just keeps improving and changing over time. Yet for some unknown reason he feels like he has to release these mediocre EPs. If you've never heard of Montreal, don't base your opinion on these tracks!",0
"Not my cup of tea I was expecting something profound based on the lyrics, but from there it went downhill fast. It's just noise with a drum beat. Rather dissonant and annoying, actually. While it might make a great audio accompaniment to something, by itself I couldn't stand it.

"One of the best game covers Game covers aren't a rarity (just check out OCRemix.org), but high quality, faithful interpretations of game music are few and far between.  So often they go into the realms of badly cheesy and terribly modulated synth, in the expectation that, since it's better than a triangle, two squares and a noise channel, it's ""good"", and since gamers are a goofy bunch, we'll love goofy renditions.

Project X doesn't fall into either of these traps; the challenges posed by the skeletal framework of good instrumental music provided by the Mega Man 2 soundtrack are taken seriously in this album.

One of my favorites, ""Crash Man"", invokes a futuristic funk that was totally not present in the orignal, but is both completely compatible with it, with a crunchiness that helps recall the frustrations of that level in the game.  Even in the most synthy of the tracks, ""Metal Man"", the heavy ""wah"" effect used on the synth melody is carefully orchestrated to match the intonation of the tune.  ""Air Man"", another favorite, is brilliant in its simplicity - it uses synth more or less equivalent to the original, but adds a D&B track that reinvents the whole thing.

I give this a four stars because while I love - LOVE - this album, I recognize that some of that is nostalgia for the game.  There is, however, so much more to it than just being a cover of an awesome game.

Incidentally, this - as well as their earlier cover of Mega Man 3 - used to be available free online.  I was terribly disappointed when I couldn't find my copies and went looking to download, and found that the hosting location had died.  I'm very happy to see that not only is this album available again, but that the band found a way to get rewarded for having recorded it.

Hex Map: I'd love to see MM3 up here again as well; I know it wasn't as good a work, but it's still worth making available.",1

He is from back in the day, but classics do not go out of style or season..Even though I do not understand most of what he sings, it does not seem to matter because he is so interesting in the way he does it.  : )  I now have a library of his material and enjoy it often.  Of Special interest on this album are ""Ding Dong,Ding Dong,esas cosas del Amor"" and ""O Quizos Simplemente la regale una Rosa""",1
"This Should Be Amazing... I'm a fan of Rihanna. I'm a fan of Britney. A Rihanna song featuring Britney should be amazing, right? Well, something got lost in translation, because this is not what I was expecting. Let's see what went wrong:

-The song: S&M was not built for repetition, and as such was already a bit tired when this remix came out. Without any sort of change in beat, this seems like a loose use of the word 'remix'.

-Britney: I always used to make excuses for Britney, but lately I've given up. She sounds like she has a cold while underwater, and that just doesn't sell this song at all. In fact, it takes all the sexiness (there wasn't a ton to begin with) and sucks it bare.

Here's what went right:

-Rihanna: The 'Na Na Na's don't seem to ever get old, and that growl she adds to certain bits is quite nice.

-Britney: The fact that Britney is on a Rihanna song earns this two stars by default. Her delivery on certain lines is also pleasing, in a way that only Britney can sometimes deliver (see the pronunciation of 'hazy' on 'Hold It Against Me').

It's pretty obvious that this was a ploy to get S&M to number one on Billboard, and it worked. Both the song and this remix will likely fade and not be remembered amongst either of these women's greatest achievements. For now, it's kind of a nice novelty to hear on the radio, but that's it.",0

I immediately knew something was off when the first track jarringly jumps straight into a song. The transitions between songs, and within songs themselves, are terrible! Perhaps this album will sound good to someone who hasn't already listened to ""These Hopeful Machines"", but I hope people read this and other reviews and buy the right one!",0
"disappointing. i know bt can do much better. Save your money. The tracks on this album are extreme over cooked with vocals and cliche riffs. I am disappointed because I have heard BT live with some amazing progressive works recently which i was hoping to hear on this album. This is not it.

I feel as if BT is more concerned with getting the next big dance track hit. All the songs are misses.

I like BT and his earlier works. However he is going in the wrong direction.

Sorry BT.",0
"Decimates core of epic ... Huge disappointment.  I am able to promote the parent album (""These Hopeful Machines"") to fellow audiophiles but casual listeners are not geared for 10 minute song arcs.  I was anticipating using this as a bridge.  Unfortunately ""Humble"" guts the first three songs.  Their mixes/arrangements are baffling.  As tho someone imported MP3s and spliced them up in Garageband.  The transitions spike all over the place.  The remaining song tweaks are okay but many have the advantage of previous mixes.

To complain more specifically, if the original ""Emergency"" had its final 3 minutes faded out and its first 2 minutes mixed (properly) down to 30 seconds the nature of the song would have been retained.  That would have left it at about 6 minutes.

""The Emergency"" is my favorite song in ... years.  Past 5 at least.  The mix on ""Humble"" fails the song.  I will keep pointing others to the original.",0

A Complete Miss A complete miss on all counts. Color it bland. Every part of this CD was uninspired.  Most of the songs sound alike and that is not good. Dreary songwriting and an even drearier delivery. I am not sure if the horrible instrumentation hurt or helped the album by covering Emmylou's voice which was definitely not up to the level she is capable of.  I have been a fan for decades but lately Emmylou has become increasingly morose.,0

"Worthy of the classic music by Spence--best volume in series As a boy I owned all the LPs with the great music of Sam Spence.  Of course Autumn Thunder was like the Holy Grail when I found it. Naturally I was skeptical that Robidoux would measure up, and I wanted to wait a while and give him a chance; now, with so much of his music published, I think it is worthy of the tradition. For me this album is the best work he's done and the best work from this series, particularly the ""dynasty"" variations. I'm pleased his work is available and happy to add it to my NFL music collection. If you've always enjoyed NFL films, I think you'll find that while Robidoux can be overly cinematic at times, he can also do what Spence did: make me feel like I am listening to true NFL music at its best.",1

"Funny funny stuff Amy Schumer's act is completely shock value. There is no getting around that. But she delivers it perfectly so it's hilarious. Her timing is perfect. The way she delivers the hidden punch line softly after the louder set up without pause is just perfect.

It's also REALLY dirty. So if you're an easily offended precious snowflake you might want to skip Amy Schumer. If you have no sense of humor you will not enjoy this at all. Her entire act is built around sex jokes, hardships of being a woman jokes, hating other women jokes, religious jokes, and ethnicity jokes. So pretty much every hot button topic that's liable to make easily offended people angry.

As for this album, one of the best things about it is that it doesn't need the video to make it funny. Some stand ups using facial expressions and body language has huge parts of their act, so the audio only version doesn't work as well. Amy Schumer's act works fine in an audio only version. The only exception is the very last joke on the album. She does something the audience can see that they apparently find hysterical, but the joke is completely lost with this audio only version. That's the only instance though.

When she does her bit about how she's Jewish and a Christian tries to tell her about Jesus.......let me just say it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard in a stand up act. I don't want to spoil the punch line but it's in track 7. If you listen to nothing else....check that track out. It happens near the end of the track. Keep listening into track 8 as the bit continues.",1

"Great Recording, Horrible Sound. I was shocked and happy to see that ""A New Shade Of Blue"" had finally come out on cd. Next to ""Total Eclipse"" released on Blue Note, this recording is my favorite of the Land - Hutcherson collaborations. The one star is definitely not for the music, but for the sound. Obviously, they had access to master tapes because they found an extra track that wasn't on the original LP. Either the master tapes were in bad shape or the remastering engineer just didn't know what he was doing. I don't mind tape hiss. It's part of the whole analogue domain, but Harold's tenor sounds rather grainy and you can hear wow, flutter and way too much tape hiss. Some of the tracks sound like the transfers were from cassette tapes. I know many of you hard core fans of this group are going to buy the cd because of the extra track (""Dark Mood""). It is a delightful track well worth checking out. Otherwise, buyer beware. I see on Amazon that there's another version of this same cd. I'm not sure if the sound is any better or if it's another knock off of the same thing. Your best bet is to search Ebay or Discogs for a LP copy. It sounds a 100 times better than this cd.",0
Blah Don't waste your time or money.,0
"Wondeful 1989 ocassion marred by some solo singing Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.
I am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?
I did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).
The above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.",1

When I first heard Charles Wood, playing with a bluegrass band at a wedding reception, I thought he was just another bluegrass banjo picker, albeit a good one. Not until I heard this CD did I realize what a magnificent talent he is. Five-string pickers are a dime a dozen here in the Appalachians, but someone who can demonstrate the banjo's versatility as Charles does in this collection is a rare talent.  From The William Tell Overture to imitating the magic piano sound of Floyd Cramer, his adaptations of popular and classic ballads will keep you spellbound! If you like the banjo, and appreciate a true talent, you will certainly love this CD!",1

One Star ok,0
"I bought this because the track line up is a literal ""best of"" collection for my favorite Stone's tracks Some standouts that are well done, but for the most part there aren't many genuine ""alt country"" groups contributing to this album.  I bought this because the track line up is a literal ""best of"" collection for my favorite Stone's tracks, but aside from Sweet Virginia, Dear Doctor, You Got the Silver, Coming Down Again, and a few others, there isn't much of that genuine country blues groove or feel.  My favorite Stones song of all time, Torn and Frayed, sounds painfully awkward and robotic, completely missing that fantastic loose vibe and rich fullness of the original. Streets of Love made me wonder if I should have had a Care Bears backpack and Glow sticks with me before heading into the Rave that the covering artist plays.  Loving Cup sounds like it tried to be some sort of mix between the Exile version and the classic ""Drunk Version"" outtake from the Let It Bleed sessions, but without any semblance of blues or country to be found anywhere.

I appreciate the attempt to put a different spin on these timeless gems, but the name of the album is a bit misleading.  This album is long on Alt, short on Country, and devoid of the blues influence lurking behind all good country music entirely.  The Deadstring Brothers, arguably the best Country Blues ""Stones Influenced"" group since the Black Crowes, are nowhere to be found on this album, which was sorely disappointing.

Worth a shot, but don't get too excited.",0

this is not NO POCKY FOR KITTY  (you've been warned) superchunk at their weakest....for die-hard fans only!!,0
"Here's where you take out your wallet... This album represents a turning point for the band. Long time 'chunk fans point to the lo-fi abandon of No Pocky for Kitty or Foolish as the pinnacle of Superchunk's impressive 15 year (and counting???) arc. However, for my money, this album combines the frenetic pogo hopping style (Hyper Enough comes to mind) of their early albums with the more hypnotic, pensive sound (Eastern Terminal) that will emerge on later albums. This is a strong album from start to finish, one that I return to time and time again. It's a great place to start your collection because the band's past and future are echoed so well.",1
"A classic indie rock album I know most Superchunk fans consider their debut or ""No Pocky. . ."" the best in the band's catalog, but I disagree.  While their first two albums are great, they represent Superchunk as nothing more than a great garage/punk band.  And that's not a bad thing.  But ""Here's Where The Strings Come In"" proves that Mac and the band are capable of more than just catchy, three-chord power punk.

""Silver Leaf and Snowy Tears"" starts with a mellow picking pattern and evolves into a driving rocker by the end.  ""Animated Airplanes Over Germany"" is easily one of the most complex songs the band has ever written.  I consider this album to be their peak and it does not get the attention it deserves.

If you want to dig deeper into the Superchunk catalog, beyond the immediately catchy tunes like ""Cool,"" and ""Throwing Things,"" pick up this album.  That's not to imply there aren't catchy tunes on this one, they're just not as obvious on first listen.

If you need an immediate hook, then the first track, ""Hyper Enough"" should do the trick.  But stick with the rest of the album.  These songs will grow on you quickly.",1
"Beginning of the softening of their sound. This came out in 1995.  Indoor living, from 1997 was their last of 5 great albums along with indicental music, foolish, no pocky for kitty and mouth to mouth.  This is the beginning of the slide to a generally more gentle sound.  They got declawed a bit.  Worse, they didn't write any of the real together, soaring, 2 guitar power songs here that they did on those 5 albums.  I'm glad I got virtually all their records.  Who knows, in 10 years when I'm 61 maybe I'll be more into this and their other late 90's/2000's records, less fast, less powerful.  Though, on listening to this, none of the songs hit that great musical groove that 5 to 11 of their songs do on those 5 great albums.

"Terrible Recording....... I first heard this on the Heineken Commercial and really got intrigued.....so I came to amazon and looked over all the ""Golden Age"" offerings by The Asteroid Galaxy Tour and really liked what I heard...this 5.05 recording SUCKS.... if it is supposed to be remixed to be un-listenable and un-understandable...we...the customers need to be warned.....the little bit of the sample are not a good offering of 99.9% of the recording offered, especially if you do not know the music very well.....
Personally I thought this was just a longer version with a weird intro..and being a psychedelic band that would be normal......but not this and it sucks....I hate to say.",0
"Really, really bad mix Why is it whoever produces this crap insists on mixing in random noises from the audience?  It's annoying to get the crowd sounds at full volume during the song.  Please, it's live.  I get it.  I don't need you to crank up the hoots and hollers to get the full effect.",0
"Foul language? Shame on Amazon for not giving a warning about foul language. I am sorry if I am wrong, but I have searched the net for lyrics for Runner. I hear the word ""G..D..."" many times throughout the song. I downloaded the mp3 without knowing this.  There was no warning, now I am trying to get a refund. I like this band. The lead singer has a unique voice.  Why does she think this language is necessary?
Does Amazon think that their customers are ok with this language? I will have to somehow be more careful. Amazon, let tv advance the moral decline, don't help.",0

"A tiny taste I do not quite see the point of selling five minutes worth of Ralph Fiennes reading ""Kim"".  I thought $.99 was incredibly cheap, but then there are sometimes bargains to be had on Amazon.  The description listed the length if this audio file as 5:19 (or something like) minutes.  I could not tell if it meant five hours and 19 minutes, or five minutes and 19 seconds.  I decided to risk a buck. Just so everyone knows, it is the latter.

"Dear God why? Why have they released this at the wrong speed? I bought Steady Rollin' Man album that slowed this to the proper 78 rpm from the 81 rpm it has been heard at since 1937.  Instead of Alvin the chipmonk on crack you get a full throated Robert Johnson on Steady Rollin' Man. It is a revelation to hear him as he actually sounded. Released a couple of years ago, I see it is for sale used for one cent.  The folks who released this I assume know about the controversy over the speed issue. It is all over the net. There is no question that the slowed version is right, so I ask why this release?",0

"Beautiful song for wedding march. Beautiful song. I never really listened to the words from the pop version, it irritated me. However, this version/cover (original version?) is very slow with piano and strings and a soulful male voice. It is beautiful. Especially for an outside setting. We used it to walk down a paver garden path to the lake for our wedding. Very sentimental. Not a dry eye in the place! The song finished with about 30 seconds to spare after we walked and was perfect for the lake back drop to start the beginning of our ceremony.",1
"Meaningful I like the original version of this song but after hearing this I'm tempted to change my mind. Jason Walkers take on it is much more personal, deep and thoughtful than six-pence-none-the-richer's fast version (no offense guys!) I love it!",1

Five Stars Petra sounds better than ever.,1
"Best Live Album ever!!! As a lover of both Petra and loud, heavy guitar; Bob Hartman and company out-do themselves like never before with this AWESOME live offering! I don't particularly care for live albums because the production quality isn't that great, but his live version of Classic Petra hits is way over the top with HUGE, GIGANTIC guitar never before found on the early Petra albums with Greg X Volz. So for me being a major metal fan the big, heavy guitar is an enormous plus! Also, the vocals are amazing! Greg is wailing like old times and the mix is wonderful! This is the Petra I seen in the Ohio Theater in Columbus in 1984 only better...if that's possible! LOL! Also, and more importantly the anointing of God is ALL over this recording! Oil drips from every song as Jesus is lifted high and given glory! This is my new staple album and will be for a long, long time. If you haven't gotten this yet...GET IT! You won't be disappointed! Blessings to you all!

"Not my type of music I bought this album at a vintage record shop.  It's a rare and hard to find album and therein ends it's charm unless maybe you are from the era of peace, love and better living through chemistry.  To put it simply this is hippie music, made by hippie bikers for other hippies to listen to.  Maybe that's your thing and maybe you'll love this album.  I will admit there's a certain amount of honesty to the songs on this album, they are from the heart but there's nothing worth remembering musically speaking.  They just don't stand out as something special.",0

"Not bad A ""Warrant"" album without Jani Lane - it just didn't seem right to me, especially after his death. So I resisted this for a long time. I finally decided I'm a fan of more than just Jani Lane. I enjoy the guitar team of Erik Turner and Joey Allen as well. I decided to give this a chance.  I don't love it, but I do really like it.  It has some very solid tracks - ""Home"", ""Life's A Song"", ""Sunshine"" being my favorites. No real clunkers on the album. Solid album.  No, it will never be the same without Jani, but ""The Show Must Go On"" right?",1
Oops. I bought this for one of my friends as a part of his Christmas gift because I knew he was really into this band. Unfortunately I found out he already had this vinyl. The shipping dates were outrageous for expected delivery. I didn't know it was possible to order from the moon. The package came in this morning after I nearly forgot about it and the corners of the vinyl casing were bent. Now I'm going to try to sell this to Newbury Comics in hopes of buying another vinyl I'm praying he doesn't have.,0

"Great Sound This is essential for any Orbison fan. Sure, you could buy the albums but you'd miss hits like, ""Falling"", ""Mean Woman Blues"", ""Uptown"", etc. I highly recommend purchasing this and the Monument Boxset, which includes the three albums (Roy Orbison Sings Lonely and Blue, Crying, In Dreams) he originally recorded at Monument plus a previously unreleased album, ""Oh Pretty Woman"". This collection also includes individual sleeves for each record plus a full sized piece of paper with Roy's image and a little backstory on him.",1
Avoid Like The Plague Not only are these covers but they are covers sung badly by people who can't sing.  This is truly a worst buy and hopefully Amazon will remove it from the list of availalable music.,0
Still Rocking!! Great sound from the boys of Warrant. Jani Lane may be gone but his influence on the band is very much alive. Killer track!!,1

"The Corners top their first album This album is a must have for anyone who enjoys unique, moving lyrics combined with music that is folk and yet modern. The Corners do a great job of conveying powerful truths through song, but on top of that, they will also get you to tap your toes along with them.
Each song is distinct to the style of the band, but each track shows the diversity of the members' talents. The flow of the album is great, and you don't feel like it's anything you've heard before.
The Corners are a gifted new band that you will enjoying listening to until your iPod explodes.",1
"Won't even play It said that you're downloading the MP3, but when it finished downloading, it's a MP4, and that won't play on my computer or on my MP3 player. What a waste.",0
B Side Wins I heard this song before the album came out and thought it was a B-Side that wasn't gonna get light on an album. So glad it came out on Fear album.,1
"Lyrically Excellent, Musically Boring First, let me preface this by saying that Sojourn is a great ministry full of talented artists.  Isaac Watts has written some of the most inspiring hymns the church has.  Mixing these two things together can only be good.  My review has nothing whatever to do with the lyrical content of the songs - it is solid and awesome, without exception.  I'm only focusing on music here.

Like the other commenters, I really like Sojourn's music. ""Over the Grave"" was my 'gateway' to Sojourn and I was very eager to see what the second volume of Isaac Watts hymns would sound like.  Unfortunately, not being much of a blues fan, I have a really hard time getting into this album.  Aside from my own preferences, I still gave it several careful listens to write a review.  I have to conclude: this album is also not half as musically diverse as ""Over the Grave.""  It does sound earthy, as other commenters suggested - a little too earthy - and also just plain slow, boring and predictable. With one or two exceptions (""Compel My Heart to Sing""), gone are the creative, unexpected progressions of ""Living Faith"" and ""Refuge.""

Sorry, Sojourn - I deeply love a lot of your music, but where did the fire and energy go? Some of the music also hit my ears as wildly incongruous with the lyrics - ""Let the Seventh Angel Sound"" is a song about the triumph and terror of the last day, but the music sounds like a silly Blues Traveler jam session.",0
"Beautiful Performances of an Extraordinary Composer's Compositions These piano pieces by Dana Suesse are superbly performed by Sara Davis Beuchner in an excellent recording. I have heard other pianists perform some of these pieces, but Ms. Beuchner's renditions are the most successful at preserving the spirit of Dana Suesse. My only complaint about this CD is the conspicuous absence of the haunting 'American Nocturne.' Perhaps Ms. Beuchner will honor us with a performance of this lovely composition on a future CD. Concerning the pieces themselves, it is unfathomable to me that they are not well known. They can be heard repeatedly over time and new things are discovered with each listening. They are indeed exemplar of the times in which Suesse blossomed, nostalgic in a way, but they stand on their own and are elegant, beautiful works of art.",1

Lamb of God (Instrumental) I was looking for a song for a family video I was making and fell in love with it's beautiful sound. I no plan to listen to it often on my play list.,1
Not Version I thought This version doesn't start with the slow sad part of the song - it starts out energetically and the slow sad part is still pretty jazzy.  It bugs me that I had to buy it to find that out :/,0
"ARE YOU FREAKING ""SIRIUS""???!!! It's bad enough that I have to give this even one star just to leave the review. This sounds like complete trash. As if the mic that the ""singer"" used was his computer mic, and that the band is using toy instruments intended for 5 year olds (who were probably the ones that wrote the lyrics).
If they had fun making it, then that's great, but I'd hate to see anyone pay money for this.",0

"Slapped together, but worth the download Note that the official orchestra which will play at Will and Kate's wedding will be the London Chamber Orchestra, not the orchestra featured on this recording.

You should get your first clue on the hurried assembly of this album by looking at No. 56 ""The Marriage of RIGARO.""  Um, what?  Also, after downloading, I found that quite a few of the pieces didn't have the composer's name attached.  This really wouldn't have taken long to do.  If you like to keep your classical collection cleaned up by composer, you'll have to fill them in yourself.

I highly doubt Kate would choose ""Amazing Grace,"" [track 4] complete with banjo backup for either her ceremony or reception. Just my opinion.  ""Dies Irae"" by Benjamin Britten [track 7] means ""Day of Wrath.""  Also can't imagine ever hearing this one at a wedding.  Overall, there are some random warhorses of the popular classical repertoire here, which would not make good wedding or reception music.

On to the good points.  The recording features some notable orchestras and ""The Royal Wedding Orchestra"" does a fine job, particularly on ""The Earle of Oxford's March"" and Mendelssohn's iconic ""Wedding March.""  There are some satisfying long tracks like the 1812 Overture (with cannons and church bells!) and the Emperor Waltz.  The full spectrum of musical eras is represented, from William Byrd (Renaissance) up through Vaughan Williams and Britten for the 20th Century.  It's a nice collection if you don't have these standards already, or are seeking alternate versions to possibly improve your collection.

Edited to add:  Tracks 36 and 51 are virtually identical.  Both are solo piano versions of ""Liebestraum"" by Franz Liszt.  More evidence of the sloppy nature of the compilation.

If you're seeking artists that Kate and William will be hearing, I'd suggest you look at the recordings of Claire Jones, who is the official harpist to the Prince of Wales and will be playing at the reception.  The London Chamber Orchestra also has extensive listings on Amazon.

Overall, I recommend this album at the $1.99 price.",1

"The only saving grace is Nadia Ali's vocals When I first heard the announcement I was uber excited.  Iio has been my favorite since they started!  However, I am also a big fan of Nadia's solo act and instantly wondered why she wasn't promoting this work.  It was very odd considering she promotes her work quite aggressively.

However, I patiently waited for Amazon to release the downloadable mp3s and finally purchased it.  I've listened to the entire album about 3 times now.  Like the title says, the only good thing about this entire album are the seductive and mesmerizing vocals of Nadia Ali.  The production is quite one-dimensional, boring, and plain.  In some tracks it's flat out bad.

Marcus Moser needs to dig deep within himself and produce something original and something that has soul.  I think it's time for him to stop making money off of Nadia Ali's older recorded songs that didn't make it into the Poetica album.

The Iio duo - Nadia Ali was clearly the stronger artist.  Now that she's gone, Iio lacks soul and vision.",0

"This song helped me through a hard time. When I lost my great grandmother, it was like I lost my mother.  My mom was a struggling single parent, and my great grandmother was my main time caretaker when she was gone working long hours.  My grandmother's death was like losing my other parent and hurt so much that I could hardly breathe.  This song helped me open up my grief and pour out all the pain I had tried so desperately to hold.  By doing that, I could finally set myself free from my made prison inside my soul.  If you feel disconnected from God because you are struggling, this song sings deep into your soul and gives you the ability to get down on your needs and ask for God to help you.  Even if you are not going through any trouble, this song satisfies from mainstream music that may lead you toward a more desperate and hurtful direction should something arise.

"5 stars for sure. i've been listening to this for over a week straight ...  (maybe ""daily"" would be a better way of putting it.. lol) .... and i don't see me stopping anytime soon. it has some very unique and clever tunes in it, and lyrically it isn't piled full of rubbish. Buy This... 5 stars no question.",1
Instrumental Music for Infants Album contains 51 peaceful songs for infants. Very conducive to lulling a baby to sleep. Can also be used to provide soft background music for child's playtime.,1
"Meh. This album was... ok. Unfortunately it all has about the same feel and pattern so there's very little diversity to the music, which can seem a bit monotonous.",0
I dislike. The song skips and stops everytime I play. It stops then comes back on and it was for the baby. I love the song but I cant listen to it all the way with out it stopping.,0
Rock On! I have to re-download this song on my kindle since my wifi was lost during the sync.  But other than that this was one of my first purchases and I love it!,1

"Blast from the Past In my attempts to replace a single 45 RPM of this song I once had in the 60's, I listened to samples of quite a few versions.  My research lead me through groups like The Ventures, but this version is the one I remember.  What was great about this version, was I could imagine a horse and rider galloping on a prairie.  One hears what could be sounds of hoofs hitting the ground at galloping speed, possibly a bird whistling, and this pretty tune.  I'm sure all the sounds were from guitars and the effects they could produce at that period of time.  Out of all the single versions of the instrumental ""Apache"", this is my favorite.",1
"All Synthesizers. No steel drums! I previewed every song in this collection and it is very obvious that every sound is being played by a robot on a synthesizer. The steel drum sounds are not even good ones. They sound like any Casio keyboard. They should not be allowed to sell this rip off under the name 'steel drums'. It's false advertising and you will be able to tell right away too. Don't waste your money on this. There are many excellent steel drum albums available on Amazon. Unfortunately, there are also many fakers like this. Just preview them first and you'll be able to tell the difference.",0
Great music for the ages I really love rockin to this with my nephew.  I think this is great because as he grows older he'll recognize more and more of the music that his family already listens to.  Thanks!,1
"The worst Omnia album, unfortunately! Let me just start by saying that i was really eager to buy this album because i have really loved Omnia's previous offerings for the most part. This one was a real let down! Steve has gone off on some misguided idea that he can rap (as Dr. Sic... blech) . The instrumental songs on this album are really really nice, and i recommend downloading those if you are an Omnia fan, but basically all of the tracks with vocals are not good. Just plain not good. The first time i  listened to this album i didn't like it but i thought, ""hey, i'll give it another chance, afterall, it's Omnia!"" And i listened to it again two more times, and liked it less and less each time. I liked this album so little that i actually decided that it was so bad that i no longer liked Omnia at all, in light of this present incarnation! And i liked Omnia a LOT! But after a year or so after listening to this album, i have come back to Omnia and i still enjoy their other albums very much, and like i said, the instrumental tracks off of this one. I feel like maybe they are just trying to reinvent themselves in a fashion, or trying to incorporate other influences, and it hasn't gelled yet. Hopefully in the next album it will gel! i hope so!",0
"The ESSENCE of Beautiful Music Daniel Michaels is almost forgotten, but his terrific arrangements of the standards from the great American songbook are unparalleled. These tracks are selected, I believe, from the many Reader's Digest LP's that were the backbone of every, great beautiful music station in the country in the sixties.

Buy these, put them on, reach for a Negroni with your someone special, and take a trip to paradise!",1
High Quality! High quality! Amazing collection of talent!!!,1
"One of few songs on this album to rate 5 stars Omnia went someplace that didn't appeal to me as a group but this song captures all the old magic, literally. It's a soulful instrumental, not one of their wild (and wonderful) pagan excusions, but achingly beautiful and I never get tired of it. The other songs on this album that I liked were Saltatio Vita (very similar to their old style) and Shamaniac, though that one won't appeal to everyone. But this song? It captures all the primitive magic of the moon!",1
Gross. Some sort of terrible Miku filter over a real work of art. Don't know how you're allowed to sell this on Amazon.,0
Great Blues Covers of Songs You Already Know The music on the CD was on an old Tribute Album to Eric Clapton that I have had for quite some tie..  I screwed up the CD so I had some skips on it.  Finally found the same music under a different name. Check it out....,1
"Five Stars Product exactly as advertised, and it was received promptly.",1
"Disappointing compilation For me, the weak point of most modern blues albums is the songwriting. With the huge catalog of great songs to choose from here, I figured I would strike gold with this album. Not so. Most of the tunes are bland and lifeless. If it wasn't for Taj Mahal's solo acoustic cover of Honky Tonk Women, this disc would have done a Frisbee impersonation flying out my csr window. Come on, you blues artists and producers: you are recording 20th & 21st century blues, not a lame television commercial or elevator music. Where are the dynamics, the passion? The bunch of you should have listened to records like Exile On Main Street, Derek & the Dominoes, Cheap Thrills by Big Brother before taking a step inside the studio or picking up your guitar. Should have read about those recording sessions or live performances to get inspiration. How can a bus load of amazing modern blues musicians have as their resource a catalog of songs like the Rolling Stones body of work and not come out kicking, jumping, rocking, swaying, grinding and squealing?",0

"I really wanted to like this. I have seen these guys back since their beginnings when they were a young band in Madison, Wisconsin called 'Stinkfish'.  They went on to become the 'Siren Six!' & then 'Big City Rock'.  Although, in my humble opinion nothing will ever top the energy & fun they emitted on stage & musically as they did with Stinkfish & Siren Six!, I was really happy to have seen them finally get some attention & mild success as Big City Rock when they left the midwest & headed into the sunny hills of CA.  I enjoyed the first couple of EP's BCR put out, but the s/t album was a stretch for me.  They clearly wanted to write a pop album & stand aside bands like the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, etc. of the time.  I never saw them as that kind of group.  It felt to me these guys (from BCR & before) always had an edge to their sound even when they were reaching for the mainstream audience.  They could still write awesome hooks & deliver the pop without the pretension & maintain having an identity.  With the Remainers, I listened to the clips of all 6 tracks of the EP & have to say their is nothing on here that keeps my attention whatsoever.  A huge disappointment for me.  It definitely picks up where BCR left off in the consistency & style of the songwriting but on a downward slope.  So, if you really liked that BCR s/t album then by all means, but I was hoping they would have returned to an earlier style of material they did (like the original cut of 'Human').  The Remainers songs are well crafted, recorded, & produced.  Nate's vocals sound crisp & plush, Frank's keys are good as always & the drumming hammers out like it did in BCR.  That being said, this beat goes on to orchestrate an utterly forgettable list of assembly line pop songs with not much to be desired.  Even the song titles are flat & uninspired where they have to be overtly pronounced in every chorus, as if trying to be a #1 single at every opportune moment.  They have lost their artistic balance of the pop/indie sensibility they once had & just wanted to continue to set sale into that forgettable sea of mundane dance/pop & WB network serenades geared up to appropriately target kids in their teens & early 20's.  I'm really not trying to be harsh.  I'm just not sure how else to describe it accurately for what it is & what they seem to be going for.  I think they are better than this material here & need to find their center again.  I'll have to check in at a later time & see what they go on to try next, but I don't think I can take much more of this.  For those that really, really, really, really like modern pop then give this a shot, but if you were even slightly on the fence with that last BCR album as I was then don't waste your time.",0

"It's so cute.. I love how Jenny's Mind works. She reminds me of me. Mini Lopez. The music video is just hilarious, and I haven't laughed so hard for a long time. The senario, the creative outlet. Like the shyness, the "" what's going on"" look?! Like she's lost, confused. In the music video it's like a ""CURSE"". It's like she see's this fortune teller, the fortune teller told her to take a ""SMALL"" bite out of the heart- shaped cookie. The cookie was so ""SWEET"", she made a mistake and took a ""BIGGER"" gulp. She say's ""true"" love would find you. LOL! Apparently, lol. It didn't turn out exactly the way she wanted it to be!!

I guess.. it magnetically drawn guys to her, became magically obsessed with her. lol. Everywhere she goes.. guy's keep stalking her, fighting over her. Fighting to where it's very dangerous, she needs to "" stay away"".

But the daring, Bold Lopez.. is a little mischevious, looking into trouble. Or trying to be ""curious"" of what's going on around her. People getting into car accidents, are WILD!! But, sometimes.. Curiousity ""kills"" the Cat. But.. the funny part is!! She acts like nothing ""happen"", is just dancing with a bunch of guys and Joking around.

I don't really consider that ""flirting"". It's more comical, and a cute Senario, joking around. Then her Papi comes, saves her. All the other guys are sulking, like "" screw this"". She forgets her purse, none of the guys take it. They don't want money!!

She runs off in her MINI Lopez car, is with her Papi. He's in the military. He looks like ED Tempelton. in the video. I was laughing. It was her twin.

But music videos aren't real. It's just for fun. Don't believe everything u hear! One time.. I was watching a music video, this guy had a bunch of hoochies all over him, it turned out he wasn't like that. He was actually not ""kissing"" them. They were all over him but yeah he wasn't a player. He was actually shy, modest. I remember.. jay- Z was flashing his Euro money in the camera. People were like ""yeah"" he's all cocky, greedy an flashing his money around.

It turned out Jay-z isn't cocky, greedy. I heard he's actually real, has a heart.

I suppose they say never judge people by it's cover, unless u really know them. Like the rumors of Jenny, her being a ho. They're not true! It's just gossip.

Don't believe in her music videos as well. Just because she's flirting in the video or whatever it maybe. It's the senario that's trying to match with the song.

Like "" I'm into you"". It's about a women who's into a guy. Not Jenny into that guy! People are so naive, dumb. They think because she's all over a guy in the video she's a ho. It's not true!

Only a person with a brain would understand that!",1
"Jennifer Lopez this is a hot song, i really enjoy running to it, thanks I love it, I will order more songs",0
"Not Into You When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has a lot to really think of for the next few years, aside from the cancellation  of American Idol, and her own personal life in the ruins, with the end of her relationship with her boyfriend Casper, she honestly has a whole lot  to look forward to in her future. Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.

"Old Master From 1940 Remastered to Sound WORSE Than in 1940 I bought this recording to hear Strauss' Japanese Festival Music, Op. 84 (1940). The full title is Festmusik zur Feier des 2600jhrigen Bestehens des Kaiserreichs Japan fr groes Orchester (Japanische Festmusik), since it was the only available option.

The Japanese government commissioned music from composers of six nations to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire. Other composers writing for the festivities included:

Hisato Ohzawa who wrote his Symphony no. 3, ""Symphony of the Founding of Japan""
Jacques Ibert who wrote an Ouverture de fte ""pour clbrer le 26e centenaire de la fondation de l'empire Nippon""
Ildebrando Pizzetti who wrote a Symphony ""In Celebrazione dell XXVIo Centenario della Fondazione dell'Impero Giapponese""
Sndor Veress who wrote his first symphony, ""Hungarian Greetings on the 2600th Anniversary of the Japanese Dynasty""
Benjamin Brittens Sinfonia da Requiem was also commissioned in this process, but was ultimately rejected by the Japanese foreign ministry as an insult (good for Britten!)

Japans request for a composition from an American composer was turned down due to the deterioration of relations between the countries.

Joseph Goebbels assigned the Japanese commission to Germany's most prominent composer, Richard Strauss. Strauss, age 75, put aside composition on his opera Die Liebe der Danae to work on Japanese Festival Music while staying in the Italian Tyrol. He completed the work on April 22, 1940 and received 10,000 Reichsmarks for his effort. If nothing else, the Nazis made life more enjoyable with easy money.

There are five sections:
Meerszene (Seascape)
Kirschbltenfest (Cherry Blossom Festival)
Vulkanausbruch (Volcanic Eruption)
Angriff der Samurai (Attack of the Samurai)
Loblied auf den Kaiser (Hymn of the Emperor)

Japanese Festival Music is written for a large orchestra 3 Flutes (piccolo), 2 oboes, English Horn, 4 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 8 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 2 Tubas, 14 tuned temple gongs, timpani, various percussion, two harps and strings. There is also an option for either an organ or an additional 3 trumpets, 4 trombones and 2 French horns. One of Strauss' works for chamber orchestra, in other words...

The premire was at the Kabukiza Theatre, Tokyo on December 14, 1940. Helmut Fellmer, a music professor in Tokyo at the time, conducted the NHK Symphony Orchestra augmented to 165 musicians for this occasion. The audience for this occasion also heard the other three commemorative works. Fellmer conducted this orchestra again on December 19, 1940 for a recording on Nippon Columbia.

Japanese Festival Music is probably Richard Strausss least programmed work and is often described as one of his weakest compositions. Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium (Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another. Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra (possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere); this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works (catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3), and four years later on Preiser 90205.

I didn't do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate (though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English). It would seem that these CDs are a knock-off of the Columbia Nippon 1940 recording. I was amazed at how bad the sound was, regardless of when it was recorded. In 1940, the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound, though they may have kept this capability secret, given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches, so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere. Being a murderous dictator, I presume that he wouldn't have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear ""live"" so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead (something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions, which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin, probably prompting many angry Germans to shout ""MEYER!"" in frustration). I guess that's why they didn't share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime.

At the very least, considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - don't trust those ""Strauss' Complete Symphonic Works"" CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to. As it is, I wouldn't bother listening to this recording, though from what little I could hear, the music wasn't as bad as del Mar made it out to be. Even uninspired Strauss writing music for dictators didn't sink low enough as to produce complete musical drivel bad enough to get called ""Meyer"" by detractors. The NHK's playing is otherwise tolerable, though there are some major intonation bloopers audible through the snap, crackle and pop.",0

"Let down for a huge fan I have to say that for a very adamant fan that I was very let down by this release. I've tried giving it a couple of chances and hoping that the next listen will yield a better experience but it never does. This album fails to do what their past albums have done which is to inspire awe. When I listen to old tracks such as, ""Threads"" or ""Quiet"" or basically any of their other tracks I feel  a sense of utter power. Tunnel Blanket is aptly named because while listening to you will want to curl up with a blanket and go to sleep. Gone are the tracks with ethereal guitar and pounding drums this is just now a lullaby and a bad one at that. There is a lot of synth on this LP but the whole thing to me at least just lacks substance it's very ambient but by being that way not one track on this album sticks out. I would love to listen to this to go to sleep because it is beautiful to a degree but just way under the talent that This Will Destroy you possesses. The whole thing feels a little effortless and a giant step back in their amazing music catalogue. Let's just hope on the next project they step it up a bit. I'm still a fan but I guess I expect more from this band.",0

"No way Jose I was expecting something else, no wonder it took me so long to finally give it a listen. It is a mix of ""Timbalero"" that I do not find that fantastic except for the parts that have flashes of the original melody. Honestly, this is not one of my favorites, and I say if you are going to remix something, then make it comparable (e.g. Natural Woman Carole King/Aretha Franklin, Say a Little Prayer - Dionne/Aretha, Annie's Song Anne M/?, Frio Frio Juan Luis Guerra/N'Klabe) or even better.....but this version is just plain annoying. The only way I could recommend this would be if you were a collector of all and everything EGC, otherwise why mess up a classic.",0
"Maturing, Like Fine Wine I have been listening to the music of John Michael Talbot for almost 35 years. From his early days singing with his brother Terry to his move into the Catholic Church, from his folk- rock days to his contemplative liturgical style, the center message of his music has always been to glorify God the Father, worship Jesus Christ the Son in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Whether you are an Evangelical, Charismatic, Anglican, Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran or Catholic, the message and spirit of John's music lifts you into the presence of the Lord. His latest offering is the reflection of his journey further down the road towards the Kingdom of Heaven.",1

the album sounds lazy and rushed, the 2-3 awesome tracks are all bunched together near the end but a lot of the album sounds like  lazy politics over music which comes nowehere near the excellence of 'sands of time'.

"Need more security I was inspired to listen to this gem based on the unique and complex illustrative cover art.  The second I pressed play I knew I was being taken on a musical journey.  The sad, off-tune guitar twang really set the mood and relaxed me.  I imagine this song would be great if there were lyrics and a lead singer.  Sadly, a man with a terrible cold bypassed the recording studio's security and was somehow able to begin yelling out nonsense into the microphone while this incredible band was performing and trying to create art.

Perhaps next time the studio will have more security in place to prevent masterpieces like this from being destroyed again.",0
"Intentionally bad I agree with most of the other reviewers; this song is pretty awful, although I think that's on purpose.  The fact that it's intentionally lousy doesn't make it any more listenable, though.

As far as these free ""song of the day"" offerings, another site I frequent is KCRW's ""Today's Top Tune.""  Their song today is good.  It's from Release the Sunbird, a side project of Zach Rogue of Rogue Wave.",0
"I'm an indie guy, but this is just unartistic atonal amateur hour You get used to a certain level of indie DIY ethos on many of the free downloads and that is to be commended, in my view. However, this track is of such nominal quality, both musically and artistically, that I can call it reprehensible. It's not art, it's caterwauling. You want to hear atonal art - listen to EN, Sonic Youth, Throbbing Gristle, et. al. This is just amateurs pretending to have an independent ethos and failing miserably at it. Weak sauce. Fail. Rag and bone.",0

"What the heck did I just listen to? If you don't understand what on earth the singer's trying to say in Joan of Arc's ""Love Life,"" it could be because he brays the words in such a tuneless explosion of noise that it's sometimes hard to make out the individual syllables.  Then again, it could simply be that the lyrics don't make any sense.  I'm not one who balks at deep or complex song lyrics; at the age of six or seven I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel and pick apart the meanings of songs such as ""El Condor Pasa.""  If the lyrics to ""Love Life"" go over my head, I believe it has much less to do with any lack of sensitivity and insight on my part than the fact that this sounds like the kind of nonsense I've found written in my journals after being overmedicated.

If I weren't committed to writing a honest and thoughtful review, I think I would have turned this off after the first thirty seconds.  As it is, I've listened to it several times through, I've written my review, and I can't wait to get this exercise in meaningless angst off my computer lest I get into one of my masochistic moods and succumb to the temptation to listen to it again, rather than do something far more constructive such as bang my head against the wall or beg for a reconciliation with my abusive ex.",0

"PRODUCT DESCRIPTION COMMENTARY BY JOE DROUKAS

At this point talking about each song in detail I think would be a little tedious and redundant. It's just all about a simpler time when all you needed was one pair of Levis, a guitar, a place to play, and people to listen. Like the kid in ""Thyroid Eyes"" and ""Crazy Man Band,"" it's about loading up the van with equipment, riding forever, playing as hard as you can, having some fun, then moving down the road. It's about falling in love, growing up, making choices, chasing down a dream, and saying goodbye. The old ""Yankee Trader"" peddler gave way to Woolworths and Newburys, which in turn, as the song suggested, gave way to Wal-Mart and Kmart, which is effectively killing Main Street. This album brought me to New Hampshire, and happily it has been my home for many years now. And if you drive far enough into the country you still may find that old Yankee Trader selling goods and swapping lies. I've written many songs since this album, which have gone on to have lives of their own. But it all started here. And in truth, I guess Joe Drake and I never really said goodbye, since Joe Drake the rock and roller and Joe Droukas the singer songwriter are still at odds with each other, but continue to make progress.",1

I truly wish there was a way I could return it and get my money back, but with it being a digital purchase, I don't think that is an option.  If you listen to the samples, it sounds like a handful are midi tracks, but not all of them.  After you buy it, it seems like all but a few are midi, and that isn't worth paying to hear.",0
"Quantity isn't always good I think this entire CD was created using a handheld Casio.  It sounds like MIDI files.  I had hoped that, out of 200 songs, I'd like 5% or 10 songs.  I was wrong.  So far, only two are actually good.  Oh well.",0

The words could be interpreted various ways but the fake ""Mexican"" accent describing his plan to take your stuff is absurd.

"1970 2 LP Box Set This 2 LP set that ABC/Dunhill issued of one of their biggest artists, THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS was released in early 1970. It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group's music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled "" The Last of the Magic Groups "" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group's first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70's and 80's in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed "" includes many photos "". The later pressings by MCA just stated "" includes many lyrics "" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album "" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS "" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.

This album is the last and only time that ABC/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970's, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that's the sad case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist's royalties. How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group's master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren't any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the "" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS "" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter/rehearsal takes of some of the "" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS "" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the "" CREEQUE ALLEY "" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK "" COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY "" 4 CD box set.

In addition to the collector's item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.

Side One: STRAIGHT SHOOTER, MONDAY MONDAY, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, I CALL YOUR NAME
Side Two:DANCING IN THE STREET, ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT, CREEQUE ALLEY, DANCING BEAR

"the best album nobody knows about I think I found this album randomly one time I searched here on Amazon for this band. I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his previous albums. Still to this day I haven't met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to review it.
This album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that instead of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more 'pop' than the previous, but I believe that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.
but on past my rant: I'll review the tracks:

Gold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace's amazing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it's pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can't resist singing along with. (8/10 rating)

Lame Duck - Beautiful mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn't have anything in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I love lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5/10)

Connected - Amazing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10/10)

Complications - While this track seems overshadowed by ""Connected"" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn't have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I've listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you'll be glad you did. (8/10)

Had To Be There - Don't discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to ""Complications"" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), however this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I'm never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I love singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9/10)

Don't Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace's unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perhaps because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5/10)

Misery -  after listening to this album this has become my new favorite. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn't seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else's favorite, I just absolutely love the lyrics because of the way he defines Love. Normally i'd probably give it an 8/10, but because I love the lyrics it gets: (10/10)

Gods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don't sound 'beautiful', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn't care for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8/10)

Train Stop - This song is refreshing if you've listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There's a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never boring to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5/10)

In conclusion this album is what it is and won't make excuses for it's possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan. When compared to the previous I Can Make a Mess... albums, this one earns it's spot as equal to them.

"Wrong Song By the time that I notice that I had picked the wrong Hells Bells, if was too late.  I wanted the original, this version sucks.

"Another Sad Cover This review is actually a repeated opinion of another cover work that was bought at the same time. But my opinion still applies to this work for the same reasons.
  ""This is a talented band. I think they can be proud of the quality of the music they play. However, they are not AC/DC and they should be more forthcoming in titling and labeling this product they are selling. Is there confidence so low that they cannot present themselves clearly and openly as providing cover work? Or are they just scheming to make more money by having the public buy their product without realizing these are not the original songs? Go to youtube and listen to the original versions. I think it is worth the effort to search and buy originals. I appreciate these covers too but not how they are selling them.""",0

"The worst thing is... The artist used a stock, royalty-free sample from Apple's iLife software suite to base his song upon. Not only does this qualify him as a total hack without a creative bone in his body, it also creates problems for anyone else who wants to use that royalty-free track as background music for - let's say - a video on Youtube. Youtube's music recognition software recognizes the music in your video, and because this idiot has somehow gotten his ""song"" published, they mistakenly credit him for your music track. This dude isn't the first to cause problems for people across the internet by doing this, and he probably won't be the last.

"Lack of Info Wheras the quality of the recording and the artistry of Ales Barta is excellent, the information is catastrophic: None!
Whenever we see a ""BWV-Number"" next to a piece, a connoisseur  knows that the composer is J.S. Bach (e.g. pieces No. 1-3)
What about the rest? Who knows for example that no. 4 is from Joh. Brahms, no. 8 from  Lon Bollmann and no. 9 from  Olivier Messiaen ?
Why are the composers not mentioned?",0

"Old school redux I remember this cover of a song that was popular when I was in junior high from when it came out while I was in college. I still like it. Lydia Lunch was one of those slightly off center not-quite-punk artists of the late 70s (""No Wave"" according to Wikipedia). The vinyl was relatively scarce and sought-after back then. No such issue with downloaded MP3, and not the Classics IV.",1

"From MainlyPiano I have been a big fan of Robin Meloy Goldsby's music since Robin Spielberg introduced me to it at least fifteen years ago with an unreleased cassette tape. I have also been a big fan of her writing since she asked me to write a ""blurb"" for her first book, ""Piano Girl,"" several years ago. Five CDs and three books later, I'm a bigger fan than ever! Goldsby recently released a new book and companion CD both titled ""Waltz of the Asparagus People."" The book is subtitled ""The Further Adventures of Piano Girl,"" and each chapter is an autobiographical story, most of which occurred after the tales in ""Piano Girl.""

The fourteen piano solos on the companion CD correspond to the stories in the book and richly illustrate them with sonic colors and textures.  They also make me wonder how Goldsby could ever feel that her playing isn't ""good enough"" for a concert stage. What I DO understand is the feeling of absolute panic at the thought of a full room of people sitting and listening intently rather than simply enjoying her music in the background over dinner and drinks. Goldsby's piano touch is graceful and elegant, but is also completely approachable and inviting. Eight of the tracks are originals, five are her arrangements of favorites, and one was composed by her daughter, Julia. Some of the cover tunes would be considered pop music in most pianists' hands, but Goldsby adds such a warm and personal interpretation to them that she elevates them to a higher dimension and makes them her own. Her original compositions are even more personal and come from deep within. All fourteen pieces are exceptional with no filler anywhere on the album. The covers include Yiruma's popular ""A River Flows in You,"" The ""Feather"" theme from ""Forrest Gump,"" the theme from ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Comptine D'un Autre &Eacute;t&eacute;, L'apr&egrave;s-Midi"" by Yann Tiersen, and ""Air on a G String: The Glass Piano"" based on JS Bach. I love all of Goldsby's originals, but especially like ""Mother's Hands,"" ""Till I Lost You,"" and ""Little Big Soul.""

Including its whimsical title, ""Waltz of the Asparagus People"" is exceptional in every way and is sure to be on my list of Favorites for 2011. I give it my highest recommendation.",1
"I Don't Like This Album...I LOVE THIS ALBUM! Yes...I admit it!  I'm a HUGE Debby Boone fan (and Marie Osmond fan too...but...DON'T JUDGE ME! LOL!)

Debby's first two albums, the rushed debut (to build-on the hit ""You Light Up My Life"") and the better 2nd album, ""Midstream"" showcased just how good Debby's vocal chops were.  However, it wasn't until her perfect 3rd album (""Debby Boone"") that made this guy stand up and shout ""I LOVE THIS WOMAN""

The album starts with 2 fantastic songs, ""Girl Don't Come"" and ""Jamie""...uptempo songs for Debby and she just nails them both.  Track 3, ""The Worst That Could Happen"" makes me forget that it's remake and fits perfectly after ""Jamie"" but before ""With All Of My Love"". Ending Side 1 is ""I'll Never Say Goodbye"", a ballad that entices you to flip the album over for more.

Side 2 begins with Debby's version of ""Choosey Beggar"", one of my alltime favorite songs by this woman.  The Country-ish ""Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart"" follows and it's just awesome.. Next, comes the only hic-cup on the album, the disco-ish ""Meet Me On The Dance Floor"".  Not my favorite and a bit out of place on a collection of near perfect songs. ""You Took My Heart"", a nice ballad follows all leading up the THE ULTIMATE CLOSING TRACK ""I'd Rather Be Alone"".  A PERFECT beautifl ballad sung like no one could sing. I LOVE IT!

Some label needs to get this classic on CD...like...NOW!!",1

"Italian Formal Imperative & Future Tenses Let's Learn Italian Intermediate Volume 3 does an excellent job in providing examples of two important verb tenses: the Formal Imperative and the Future.  As with the first two CD's in the Intermediate series, Chantal makes the learning process both informative and enjoyable.

The first part of the CD covers the Formal Imperative, which is the form you're most likely to need unless you're visiting friends or relatives.  Commands are kept simple but useful: ""Vada in quella direzione."" (Go in that direction.)  One example shows that even a simple phrase like ""Mi dica"" (Tell me) can change meaning depending on the context: ""Si, mi dica?"" (Yes, what can I do for you?)

Most of ths CD is devoted to the Future tense, equivalent to ""will do"" in English,
using widely-used verbs in common situations.  Some examples show how direct and
indirect object pronouns are combined with these verbs in sentences: ""Glielo diro
appena lo vedro."" (I will tell him it as soon as I see him.)  Other examples
demonstrate the Future in idiomatic phrases: ""Se le cose non andranno meglio, ci
daremo al bere."" (If things don't improve, we're gonna take to drinking.)

For those who are familiar with LLI Intermediate Volumes 1 & 2, this CD will feel
very familiar, continuing in Chantal's molto simpatico style.  I highly recommend it.",1

"Somewhat disappointing Being a fan of Alec Empire's other recent releases, Futurist and The Golden Foretaste of Heaven, I was really looking forward to this one, so much that I bought the mp3s without even previewing any of the tracks and without reading any reviews.  I should note that I'm also a fan of his earlier album The Destroyer.

This album starts off great.  The first track, Control Drug, is exactly the style that I was hoping for - nasty synth sounds with drum & bass / jungle style drums and distorted vocals.  But things quickly go downhill from there.  The next track, Shivers, is plain boring.  It's one of those slow and simple songs that Alec Empire simply shouldn't be doing because it's not what he's best at.  Stick to what works.  Although I certainly dislike the cheesy, dated, 4/4 ""house"" style of the third track, Baby Skulls, the rolling bassline, the cool synth sounds, and the way the song builds, all make up for it.  It makes me nod my head and crank up the volume, so what more can you ask for?  Track four, If You Live Or Die (Live 2008), was surprising to hear for the first time because I like that song (it's from The Golden Foretaste...) but there's really no reason to hear the live version more than once.  It's not much different than the non-live version.  I would have preferred to hear new material such as the next superb track, Vampire State.  It's kind of dubstep sounding but more unique than most of the dubstep that I've heard.  1000 Eyes (Film Version) combines the dullness (slow and boring) of Shivers with the pointlessness (another old song?  really?) of If You Live Or Die (Live 2008).  The album ends with t.o.t. which has some kind of dated blip sample in it that reminds me of old Aphex Twin material, over another one of those house beats.  It's a very uninteresting way to end this album and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

If you are also a fan of the same Alec Empire albums and styles that I am, I recommend taking advantage of this ""mp3 download only"" album and only downloading the tracks Control Drug, Baby Skulls, and Vampire State, which I'd give 4 stars average.  But the album as a whole - 3 good tracks, 2 tracks that put you to sleep, and two versions of old songs - is somewhat disappointing.",0
"Pretty good remix of an enchanting song, but there's a better remix out there I used Shazaam to find out the details of this song, which i heard as part of a DJ set that a friend of mine recorded and made available to his friends. The Nobody Remix is slightly different than the one in the DJ set, though, and it's not quite as good. The mixed in beats don't quite settle in my opinion. I still like it, but it feels like it needs tighter mixing on rhythm and relative volumes of different pieces.",1
"A ""Crank the Window Down"" Set I won't claim that this CD sets a mood; the tone of ""My Boyfriend"" and of ""Hide From Me"" are completely opposite. However, if you want something very definitely not mainstream pablum, but rocking enough to crank down the windows and turn the radio up, then I recommend Dick Tracy Must Die.

Yes, I own the CD. Yes, I DID crank the windows down and turn the volume up...on a very hot day, too.",1

"CAREFUL - This is simply a reissue of a 2002 Rutter Album I was looking for John Rutter albums on Amazon, while listening to ""The John Rutter Collection,"" a 2002 compilation put out on Decca.  (It just arrived today from one of the Amazon used music sources.)

The cover of this current 2011 album, titled ""The Very Best of John Rutter"" has also been put out by Decca and even uses the SAME PICTURE of the tree by the lake, backed by mountains, that is featured on the 2002 album.

When one looks at the 22 songs listed on this Amazon Web Page for ""The Very Best of John Rutter,"" surprise of surprises, the choral numbers are exactly the same as my album, ""The John Rutter Collection.""

"Uncommonly Terrible Mozart.  Nothing like described. I bought this a year ago, excited to hear Mozart in 5.1 surround.  I was expecting a symphony.  It sounds like something made on a cheap computer.  I couldn't listen past two minutes.  I thought it was a joke at first.  I guess the joke is on me.  I'm sure I own over 1,000 CDs and DVDs, and this is the worst of them all.

Wish I could give it ZERO stars.",0
"Warning: This Is Not What You Think This disc is really nothing more than midi music recorded on multiple channels. If you want to know what it sounds like, listen to a Casio keyboard playing public domain classical music. Rubbish of this kind of  is available many places for free. All they did was add the extra channels, but this adds no nothing whatsover to the experience of listening to this and is of very poor quality. Again, it just sounds like an electronic keyboard playing on your sound system (awful). There is nothing artistic or creative here whatsoever. That is the reason that you do not see any samples here.

Here is the kicker and what really throws up the red flags though: It seems that all of the positive reviews here are fake, designed to convince you that this is a actually a good product worthy of buying and listening to. I have investigated the histories of all of the 5 star reviewers and commenters for this series, and you can do the same. This is a known guerilla marketing tactic perpetrated, I believe, by one person. You can see this for yourself by simply clicking on all of the reviewer's (and commenter's) names and looking at their other reviews, comments and lists. You will find that they are ALL for this series only, with a very few for others, BUT even those few are cross-linked right back to promote these. In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest reviews by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake review under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest review, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this review as well.  It has already happened to my review of another disc in this series (Bach). You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.

I hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics. Amazon reviewers have steered me clear of other bad products and consumer rip-offs while greatly aiding my many purchase decisions, and I feel happy to be able to give back to the community here.",0

"Brand new-- old school feel The band hails from northern Virginia and I got to see them a few times and they were tremendous.  Bass player Christian De Mesones is a master with the funky groove lines and soultry feel.  The band overall is a great mix of talent and they blend well together to create a jazzy-cool feel.  Most of all, this is an example of local talent from Northern Virginia that is available for all to hear.  It is great to see Groove Skool making it big time, they deserve it and hard work and dedication does pay off.  My favorite song is Latin Jive and it is just another example of their versatility to create a mix of Latin Jazz and Soul.  The songs are all different in style and sound that will appease to all Jazz, Latin Jazz, and soul music fans. A must have.  Good luck guys and keep it up!

"Incomplete episodes. The first story ""The Case Of The Roving Corpse"" is missing at least one part. The announcer says to ""tune in next week for part Four"" but there are only two parts in the collection. The worst thing you can do with a mystery is to leave out the ending making the mystery a complete mystery!
Also the story ""Rendezvous With Death"" is actually a shortened version of ""Death On The Nile"" which is not the fault of the seller. It's what the broadcasting company renamed the episode when it was produced.
Additionally, Harold Huber may not be the actor playing Hercule in every episode since the voices are not the same in all stories and there isn't always a mention of who the actors were.

"The Orchestration in this recording should be Taboo. I gave this two stars not because of the incestuous subject matter. The two stars are for orchestration. Personally, I hate musicals that use cheap keyboards to replace or fill in for musical instruments. Most of the songs in this recording have that cheesy string setting, the kind you'd get on a cheaper brand keyboard or what would be used in karaoke clubs. Maybe this was budget or maybe they wanted it to sound cheesy. In any case the sound of the band or orchestra in this recording is really bad. The singing is ok, not broadway great. The price to download or buy is a little high for the so -so quality that you are getting. In terms of the story, you don't get much listening to the recording. Listening to the CD I picked up it was a  love story between siblings and going to prom. That's all I gathered from the recording. I have not seen the movie. But.. I'd guess the movie is not any better then the CD. If you are going to write a musical about a subject like incest or anything taboo, put some money and time into the CD. Make it at least sound good orchestration and singing wise... even if the plot is thin, cheesy and taboo. I would NOT download this recording, you'll only delete it later.",0

"Music After seeing Jake Clemons in concert at a small venue in Vermont, it was clear to me that here was a man unafraid to write and sing from his heart, to give his soul voice and encouraging others to do the same.  The energy put out there by him on stage through spoken words and his music is so honest that it reaches into your own heart and soul.  Now having some of the songs I heard live is like reliving a moment of deep feeling, good vibes, and realizing that who he is, he can be nothing but honest.  Love him!  And his saxophone playing speaks volumes as well, as though Clarence is doing a duet with him.  As Jake has said in speaking of his uncle, ""It takes two.""  The entire band exudes wonderful energy as well.  It is clear Jake is careful who plays with him and finds the best.  I hope this band goes far, as it brings a new and more pure energy to music.",1
"it's super noticeable and super annoying There is a skip in this version of the song, it's super noticeable and super annoying. It's on the word 'farm' in the second line.

Very weird and throws off the whole song, screwing up the rhyming scheme of the first part.",0
"Alert!  Needs to be re-recorded! There was a skip in this version of the song!  Please use a new track of this song, there was a skip in it at the beginning!",0
this is a good song to purchase I rated only 4stars for the simple reason I have another version on my blackberry phone that on is sinking hot but this one is good I recommend this,1
"Overrated and out of date...good efforts here, but only for fans of the artists I don't expect this album to one of the alltime best sellers since it's release is ill-
timed and most of the artists involved had no connection to John Lennon, esp-
ecially Paul McCartney. Understand up front that I am no Beattles fan. I like Geo-
rge Harrison solo, especially (I Got My Heart Set On You, for instance), even his
videos (The Moose singing in there is precious!). Only Robin Zander of the Cheap
Trick bands has some connection in that the original Cheap Trick's Bun E Carlos
and Rick Nielsen did studio work with Lennon on his double fantasy album with Yoko
Ugly, er, ah Ono (she isn't!). Two or those songs got cut from the final project at the
last minute. Zander, comes off well here. But I suggest you get Siren - All Is Forgiven
, w/ Jon Brant.",0
I didn't enjoy it I took a chance and paid .99 for the CD. There is a reason why it was being sold so cheaply.,0
didn't care for most of the songs. only 3 only liked 3 songs. wanted more broadway like material. many songs too young for him. hope next cd better. ok,0
Amon Amarth I am a bit biased as Amon Amarth can do no wrong in my eyes. This is an older Album of theres but a good one nonetheless.,1
"Be careful, this is a digital instrument soundtrack. Fortunately, I wasn't tricked into buying this particular CD.  I have accidentally purchased a MIDI CD before, and what an unpleasant surprise.  I don't know why these are made, or who gets paid to make them, but they're terrible.  The software is mid to low quality, and the programing is very robotic.  And, worst of all, they are riddled with mistakes!  Wrong notes, wrong chords, wrong rhythms...  these digital instrument soundtracks are an insult to the composers they're stealing from.

Do yourself a favor and buy the actual release.  Alexandre Desplat's score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 are wonderful.",0

"Awful covers by no-names you'll want to forget This is a collection of truly awful covers by no-name bands trying to play great works created mostly by fabulous bands. Even the title, ""Punk Goes 90s"" is a miss since various tracks in the collection -- whether one is talking about the covers or the original tracks they so badly emulate -- aren't punk at all. It's hard to understand how this collection went so wrong. My wife and I are planning to have a yard sale in two weeks, and it occurred to me that if I had a physical copy of this collection, it'd be the kind of thing I'd put in a basket to sell for 25 cents. I'd feel guilty unloading it on someone for more.",0

"Brainstorm I believe this was their single off this release which is one great pick,all the songs on this Cd are really great. This Cd was my first introduction to this German metal band. This song has all the trademarks for a metal anthem in it wth a great riff,thundering bass,excellent drumming and superb singing from Andy Franck. This song and their older material waves the powermetal genre full fledged! Get it!!!",1
"Best pop album of 2011 This could be my favorite pop album ever. I don't even know if you can solely categorize it as pop since there is a rock aspect to it, but I can't put it down. It'll be on heavy rotation for a long time. Favorites are ""Keep It Up,"" ""We Don't Care,"" & ""Glow in the Dark.""",1
Five Stars Best cd by far by fates warning,1
"Absolutely AMAZING 'world class' prog rock classic! I'm not going to repeat what other 5 star reviewers said here.  But suffice it to say that 'Parallels' is a progressive hard rock masterpiece, with songwriting depth and musicianship that is... ahem... unparalleled!  Fates Warning has a way of 'painting pictures' with their music.  They can be pensive, melancholy, or downright balls to the wall metal.  But they do it stylistically, with chord and time changes that have garnered them respect worldwide!  These guys are ""musician's musicians""!  The 'give and take' styles between Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti put them in the company of other great rock dual guitarists.  Mark Zonder's drumming is clockwork, and Ray Adler is in top form.",1
"Hayler needs lyrics to match his almost unmatchable, soaring ... Hayler needs lyrics to match his almost unmatchable, soaring voice.  Thrills & chills occur when he's using his upper register.  Some songs/vocals are muted, though, as if he's dummying down his voice for a Christian audience.  Professionally trained by a world-renowned teacher, he could have accepted offers to sing opera in prestigious places around the world.  For all his talent & training, he hasn't accrued a massive library of recordings.",1
"good stuff guitar heaven....riffs that are uplifting, phantasmagoric, blistering, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah----just a great instrumental piece to kick back to",1
This sucks This song was not suitable to her voice. It was bland and boring. She needs to go back to the drawing bord. On the positive side the little girl is cute on the cover. Not my favorite at all.,0
"Jazzy performance by a real talent You have to love Sophie Milman's swinging arrangement of this old baseball standby.  I can imagine Ella Fitzgerald giving a nod to Milman's style.  It's well worth the 99 cents you'll pay to own this version.

Frankly, I find Sophie's video performance sexy, in an old fashioned, classy, there's no one in the place except you and me sort of way.  That's quite an accomplishment using a baseball song.  How refreshing in these times where tawdry is the rule.",1
"Wrong Picture and spelling of name. Havn't heard this album, but I don't need to, to know the picture on it is NOT Ann Sothern (her name was Not 'Southern') The picture is of Ann Sheridan. What teenager put all this together?",0
"Unique interpretation This is a unique interpretation of one of the most inspirational songs for me.  However, the mastering of this track leaves something to be desired, with a very abrupt cut at the end of the song.",0

"Dirtied-up retro? I don't really know how to describe this album with some pithy title. It's mostly rockabilly type melodies, but grungy, crackly, mumbley.

"Gotta love Miss Lee If you're a lover of music and big band then this will be right up your alley. A lot of this compilation reaches back well into the early 40's before we were in WW2.

"Great band I stumbled upon a youtube video or poor quality of a band called Frankie and his Fingers a little while back. The song sounded like it was pretty good but again the quality of the video wasn't so I couldn't really tell. I kind of left it at that but later on I decided to go back and see if I could find a better quality video of the band. I ended up on a myspace page where they were announcing a new record release along with a change in name, to By Land or Sea. I immediately fell in love with the songs and got to listen to that song that I wanted to hear from the youtube video - Hell Broke Loose. That song is so good.

Great songwriting and really catchy songs, I really hope that they become more well known (but not sellouts) because they really have it. I would love to hear these songs with a little better production quality but I really like the 'raw' feeling and the songs sound great. The album is good all the way through, definitely support this band by buying this album!",1

"If ""explicit"" means Christ follower... Those who are blessed to know Parker Bradway know that he would never sing, record, publish or endorse anything ""explicit"". This is a mistake that I hope Amazon will rectify immediately. Parker's music is uplifting, wholesome & represents the young man himself. You can't go wrong being a fan of his.

'Carolina Blue' is a song about two young people (in 'Carolina'-I prefer to think ""North"") who care about each other but know they have to follow their dreams. There is not a harsh word, much less a curse word, in the lyrics at all. The track is professionally recorded & the music is played by a professional country music band.

Parker Bradway is the real deal and I am delighted to support him. It is my honor to write this review & my blessed privilege to know him.

Nashville will love him, too!",1

"Expanded reissue of legendary bubblegum compilation Originally issued by Buddah in 1969, and reissued in expanded form by the UK Cherry Red label in 2010, this historic collection of bubblegum music is now available for domestic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/digital-download/dp/B004Z0PBLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">digital download</a>&nbsp;through Sony's Legacy imprint. The fourteen tracks of the original LP were pulled together from the biggest hits of Buddah's Kasenetz-Katz production team, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's ""Simon Says,"" the Ohio Express' ""Yummy Yummy Yummy"" and the Lemon Pipers' ""Green Tambourine."" Brilliant melodic hooks, crisp studio productions and child-like lyrics combined to produce songs that were instantly likeable (except, of course, to self-righteous rock fans who'd long-ago lost track of music's simplest pleasures) and more importantly, memorable. Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio's gatekeepers.

Though Buddah didn't corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, ""Sugar Sugar,"" was on Don Kirshner's Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre's exemplars. Cherry Red's (and now Legacy's) enhanced reissue drops two tunes by the Kasenetz Katz Super Circus (""We Can Work it Out"" and ""I'm in Love With You""), and adds seven titles, including the 1910 Fruitgum Company's ""Indian Giver"" (which post-dated the compilation's release), Salt Water Taffy's ""Finders Keepers"" and the Shadows of Knight's swampy ""Run Run Billy Porter."" This is both a good place to start a bubblegum collection and a terrific spin for those who are already fans.

"Great opera: Fatally flawed recording This recording quickly convinced me of two things. The first is that Teseo might well rank among Handels ten best operas, and I can imagine fans who might place it in the top five. The second is that this recording is a dreadful choice for full appreciation of this work. The music is brimming with enough beauty and drama to outweigh the plots minor flaws: some illogical decisions by the title character and his would-be nemesis Medea, and a literal Deus ex machina ending. This recording, however, taken from a live performance in Stuttgart, merely suggests what a good version might be. The distracting stage noises and an outburst of vulgar shrieking at the end of one duet might be bearable if the male roles originally sung by two castrati and a woman had not been entrusted to counter-tenors whose skills proved utterly inadequate to the music. During the last forty years we have left behind the appalling habit of the first German revivalists who transposed the castrato parts down for baritones. Unfortunately, the rise of the counter-tenor has often led to an alternative that is only a little better. There are only a handful of counter-tenors world wide who can sing these roles well enough to prevent the informed listener from yearning for the parts to be handed off to a competent female singer. None of them were hired for this performance. So, in between some solid-to-superb singing by the women in this cast, we are forced to endure florid arias that painfully reveal the deficiencies of the counter-tenors technique, and tender, lyrical arias by the same singers that range from adequate to woeful. Those allergic to the goat-bleat of the overstrained counter-tenor should stay away. Its possible that these singers may have something to offer in the studio, where they would be untroubled by the need to be heard in balconies, could enjoy a schedule that sidesteps the mounting fatigue of a live performance, and would have the opportunity for endless retakes. Id imagine that they are embarrassed enough that this performance was preserved in recording, so I won't pile on by naming them and detailing which aria found each of them at his worst. These performances merely convinced me that to enjoy Teseo to the full I probably need to secure the highly-regarded version of Mark Minkowski.
One technical note: if you decide to buy downloads of individual aria trackswhich is a plausible decision, given the bad bits youll want to avoidyou should know that two of them in Act Five are mislabeled. The track listing for the aria ""Si tamo, o caro"" follows an error of the libretto and attributes the number to Teseo (Franco Fagioli); it is actually sung by Agilea (here Jutta Bhnert) as Handel intended. And Teseos aria ""Tengo in pugno ldol mio"" is attributed to Egeo, although if you make the first click to purchase the aria you will then see the correct attribution.",0

If you appreciate blues played extremely well and sung with more soul than you can imagine then give this disc a listen.  One guy singing and playing guitar never sounded so rich and full.  The disc has artfully played standards as well as a number of originals that highlight Ken's great rythmic style. If you want to know what remote is... look up Naples Idaho on a map sometime.

"Tasteful, well-executed album recommend for everyone I had heard some buzz about this album in various places, especially it's unique blend of Eastern and Western influences, so out of curiosity I decided to download it.  I was not disappointed;  this album offers a very tasteful synthesis of the two cultures.  The mood of Beete Pal includes happiness, mixed with sadness and contemplation.  The album is full of engaging colors with both Indian and Western instrumentation and harmonies-- in particular, listen to Raaz ko Raaz (one of my favorites), Madhosh (another favorite), or Kyon Maane to hear how it works together.  (Please check out the samples;  my words here can't describe the overall sound to my satisfaction.)

I appreciate that the execution of the music on this album is very strong, and even from listening to the samples, you will be able to tell that this album was put together with a lot of care.  ""Hats-off"" to Nandini, the band, and the production staff.

Lastly, for those of you interested in approaching Indian music, this is an album worth getting.

Really nice work, Nandini Srikar.  I look forward to your next project!  I am definitely a satisfied customer and music listener, as I have enjoyed every track on this album both at home and at work.",1

"A Serious Contender I heard this band for the first time at Founders Festival 2012 in their hometown of Grand Rapids, MI.  Founders always has some great national acts on the bill and I was really excited about the two headliners. Imagine my surprise when this band stole my vote for best in show.  It is rare to see a group of musicians that can play such complex music as tightly as they do life.

Naturally, I had to purchase one of their albums when I got home.  I am a big fan of jam music.  I love bands like Phish, Widespread Panic and Umphrey's McGee.  Why are those other bands nationally famous, while UV Hippo is not?  Random chance.  Their music has melodic accessibility and rhythmic and harmonic sophistication.  Worth a listen.",1

"Simply gorgeous I am a dilettante when it comes to the work of Meredith Monk, and this was a great introduction to her work! I heard excerpts of this on her interview on National Public Radio's ""On Being"" and had to hear the rest of it. The performances here are energetic and dynamic, exploring the full range of emotion and technical capability. Monk draws from a diverse sound palette including mixed chorus, two vocal groups to augment her own ensemble; string quartet, percussion, wind instruments and portative organ. The result is a stunning composition that is as stirring as it is contemplative; joyful as it is somber; ecstatic as it is tranquil.",1
"Great Song but a Terrible MP3 recording! I would rate the song a 5 star but the MP3 version is terrible. It is supposed to be a remastered version but the sound engineer over compressed the recording and turned the volume way up. This removed all the sound dynamics leaving an overly loud flat recording with limited frequency response to boot. This has got to be one of the worst MP3 recordings I have ever heard! It is definitely not worth $1.29. Since I have had this experience with other Amazon MP3's,I will no longer buy MP3s from Amazon.",0
LOVE THIS BAND! My favorite Vokab song.  I love them and all of their music but this one is my go to.  Thanks!,1

"classic latin I noticed that the release date for this MP3 version of ""Latin Beat"" doesn't quite indicate the ""original"" release date of the Francis Bay LPs that led up to the present offering. Bay's Big Band recorded a number of sessions at the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1958. Included were arrangements of big band classics such as the Dorseys, Glenn Miller, Harry James, and Ted Heath. As a kid back then, I bought the whole catalog, with ""Flag Wavers"" being my personal favorite.

""Latin Beat"" is a brassy compilation of Prez Prado ""hits"" along with some other ""latin"" standards. The Bay Big Band was more than competent, and the stereo recordings (still a bit early in the stereo era) are nicely engineered/mixed. This is a rich translation of classic latin rhythms.",1

I bought this remastered album from Japan when it was first remastered in the mid-2000s. Those contained no bonus tracks, so I was greatly elated when it was included on the 2011 American 40th anniversary album remasters.  Having ""See What A Fool I've Been"" nicely remastered for the 21st Century is an essential track for us Queen completists.",1

"The Score While Good Tries Too Hard To Force Emotions Forced emotions are something that scores shouldn't do. Over my lifetime of listening I can tell when a score is trying its hardest to evoke a certain emotion. However, the listener should never be identifying the emotions a score is evoking; they should be feeling the emotions. Such is the case with the score to Atlas Shrugged. The emotions here are surface level, and while the arrangements are wonderful it can't seem to penetrate anymore than surface value.

Right from the first track that propels you into motion you get the sense of forced emotion. We then segway into the ""John Galt Theme"", which is covered in schmaltzy heartwarming sensibility. Now, the score does manage to go into some wonderful orchestrations that carry some emotional weight. However, once we get into the adventurous tracks the melodies somehow get bogged down by their complexity. They aren't overly complex melodies, but nothing ever builds towards anything grand. The synthetic sound of the whole soundscape doesn't help things either. Clearly this score was meant to be played by a huge orchestra and clearly synths are being used as a replacement. Now I can't speak for what the budget was, and it is very possible that was a limitation. But the score as a whole has a ""mockup"" quality to it.

By the time I reached the end I didn't feel like a progressed anywhere. The music didn't take me anywhere and in the end that's what a score should do. It should push the story, build with the cutting and not try to force it. While Atlas Shrugged isn't a bad score, it also isn't a good one. I don't want to identity emotions. I want to feel them.",0
"Nice score for an awful movie OK first, let us get this straight. There is no conspiracy against the movie. The movie is bad, it is like a grade Z effort made for Lifetime TV. Love or hate Rand and her views, the movie is hilariously awful. The movie tanked due to 2 factors: the movie wasn't marketed to a degree that a general audience knew it was there, so, people can't go see it if they don't know it exists. And then finally, the movie was just awful. Silly, poorly staged and acted.

The score however is very nice and at 7.99, it is a deal to get the download!",0

"Exercise in vocal warbling As has been pointed out this is baby music.  However, as much disdain as there is, the baby music market is huge.  I suppose you could dance to this but it is a bit sluggish / lacks energy / is impotent.  The first portion of the song is virtually a cappella where her voice is accompanied only by a drum beat and then later accompanied by a lacklusterly produced background.  Her voice does not sound auto-tuned.  I think she actually has some raw talent and it is displayed here with some middle eastern influenced vocal gymnastics. So, Beiber fans take heart. As a one star review from a relative codger like me may reflect poorly upon a song that (as I struggled to get through a listen or two) may be just right for your longing of a boy who wouldn't be able to start a chain saw.

On a side note,  I don't understand why someone selected this song off her EP as ANY of the other songs would have scored much higher in this forum.",0
"If you're over 15, don't bother I wanted so much to like Breanne Dren.  I love discovering exciting new artists, and I felt drawn to this pretty young pop singer looking out just a bit shyly from the cover of her first EP.  ""No One Else"" is a song with a sweet, albeit simple, premise: she's traveling the world, yet can't help thinking about and missing her sweetheart.

Then I actually listened to it.  Dren (whose birth name was Breanne Durenberger, without the gratuitously exotic umlaut) is 23 years old, but you'd never guess from the sound of her voice - or the content of her lyrics (""I read that message that you sent me/Baby, like all the time"").  This is teenybopper pop, and not especially good teenybopper pop either.  The singing is adequate at best (I'm still trying to figure out whether it was actually Auto-Tuned, or just SHOULD have been), and layered over a backdrop of synthetic sound, it's catchy, in the way that advertising jingles are catchy: faintly entertaining in a trivial way and simultaneously just a bit annoying even BEFORE you find you still have it stuck in your head five hours later.

""No One Else"" reminds me of nothing so much as Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" - but at her age, Dren should know better.  And unlike ""Friday,"" this song isn't quite bad enough to collapse in on itself by one of those weird laws of quantum physics and become sort of painfully awesome in its sublime awfulness.  It's just an amateurish pop song.  If your idea of good music involves synthesizer-dependence, pitchy vocals, and insipid lyrics, ""No One Else"" should be right up your alley.  If you're over the age of fifteen, don't even bother.",0

"Nothing special I feel bad giving this track by Friendly Fires only two stars.  I didn't dislike ""Blue Cassette"" exactly, but I just couldn't honestly give it that third star.  The lyrics, which speak of the poignancy of memory, are mediocre.  The musical setting is more noisy than melodic, and at the beginning and end there are some weird, annoying sounds reminiscent of music played backwards.  It's not a bad song, but it's nothing special either.  That's too bad, because the album art is perfectly glorious.",0
""" THE BITTER SUITE "" Like the old saying ""you're beautiful when you're angry,"" Carmen Rodgers sounds really good when she's bitter. And she effectively captures the stages of hurt, anger and resignation of a love gone bad on her new EP, The Bitter Suite.

It's been six years since the Dallas-based singer won a sizable number of fans with her debut album, Free, and those fans have been not-so-patiently waiting for more.  Rodgers' full sophomore disc, Intermission, a complete story of a relationship gone good, then bad, then good again, will be coming later; but she is now issuing a big chunk of it (the ""gone bad"" part) with the digital release of The Bitter Suite.

Rodgers lets the listener (and her man) know from the get go where things stand, opening with a defiant tone on the neo-soul midtempo, ""Tell Your Story"": ""Tell your story at the door / 'cause I've heard it all before / and now I'm not so sure if I want this love anymore.""  By the time of the terrific next song, the acoustic gem ""Home,"" Carmen is more reflective but just as resolved to end the relationship: ""You say you want to come home / but home is where the heart lived / and I just want to move on / so should you.""

Male listeners be a bit unnerved by the interspersed table talk of a group of women throughout the disc, who verbally lump men into a pretty bad lot of liars and cheaters.  And Rodgers feeds on that talk, vowing not to get hurt anymore on the nervous, jazzy ""Never Again,"" another EP highlight. But as the disc approaches its coda, she begins to come around, realizing that there may be some value in all that damn pain, and she finishes in a more pensive mood on the ballad, ""Better U Than Me.""

The Bitter Suite has the benefit of holding together quite well as a thematic piece and having songs (particularly ""Home,"" ""Tell Your Story"" and ""Never Again"") that can stand on their own as singles.  But, like opening a book in the middle, one can't help but want to hear the whole story that surrounds The Bitter Suite, one that will be told on the full album, Intermission.  For now Rodgers fans can celebrate the welcome, enjoyable return of the Texas musical chanteuse.  But they'll want more...soon.",1

"The Problem Is.... In the two (as of today) 5-star reviews of Liturgy's ""Aesthetica"" on Amazon, both reviewers mention how Liturgy is ""breaking all the rules"" or ""going against the trends"".  That is true...to an extent.  They don't wear corpse-paint, the album cover is white and, well, that might actually be it. (And can't we say that about a LOT of BM bands?)

You see, the PROBLEM is...they aren't going against any trends, they are part of a trend --  the trend of young American's getting into Black Metal (which, in itself isn't a problem, the conflict starts when their leader starts acting like the Scholar of Black Metal).

The BIGGER PROBLEM is...their music contributes nothing worthwhile or exceptional to the black metal scene. I could forgive the attitude of the band (pretentiousness) if they actually provided notable output, but this is lukewarm black metal. The primary influences of Burzum and Darkthrone are there, a little mid-period Satyricon. Nothing new.

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM is...while these youngsters are getting attention for this mild offering, other great new black metal bands are not -- Negative Plane, Nightbringer, Oranssi Pazuzu, and Blood Cult, to name just a few.  Also, some of the forefathers who Liturgy mooch off of have expanded so far beyond their core that it makes this album sound like a regressive work.  Arcturus, Ulver, Abigor -- they taught us that the rebellion of Black Metal could not be contained to what it was, and what Liturgy is.

Coming back around, the problem here isn't that these guys are posers, it is that they are just another bland, cut-rate black metal band among thousands.  If the album cover sported a grainy black and white photograph and a pentagram, it would of flown under the radar and ended up in a used bin somewhere.  Liturgy is thriving on what they say, not on what they do. Classic American youngsters, all talk, no walk.",0

"I really wanted to like this. This album goes nowhere and that's a shame.  There are some really good ideas in here that get squandered quickly or leave you hanging in every song.  I couldn't even detect where the choruses were on most of the songs.  I had to read the lyrics to find out.  It kind of sounds like they are trying too hard.  Song structures are all over the place.  I like being different but to be different just to be different just doesn't work.  Have an idea of what you are doing at least.  At times it sounds like a bunch of different riffs glued together to make a song.  I really wanted to like this when I found out that Kelly Sundown was in another band.  His talents are wasted here.  He is great as usual but the music leaves you wanting more and it just never comes.  I will not abandon them for this album because there are some good sections but most of the good has a lot to do with Kelly's talent as a vocalist. On the sticker it said Rock Hard Magazine gave it 9 out of 10 and this is the future of metal. I don't know what Rock Hard Magazine is but....Yeah right. Please don't insult bands like Kamelot, Symphony X and Nevermore with that statement.  THEY are the future.  It also said for fans of Iced Earth, Nevermore and others.  Iced earth's music is mediocre at best so yeah they are right there with them.  But to say Nevermore?  You have got to be kidding me.  I'll ride this until I hear another album from them.  They need to focus their ideas.  This just doesn't grab you at all.  If you listen to this pay attention to Kelly Sundown.  This album has its moments but leaves a stale taste in your mouth.

"A Nod to Bob 2: An Artists Tribute to Bob Dylan on His 70th Birthday After stumbling upon the first ""Nod to Bob"" (10 years ago on Dylan's 60th birthday), I couldn't wait for him to age another decade so that another birthday celebration would be produced.  What a tremendous disappointment!

The 60th was fun, full of surprises, and had lots of twists and clever adaptations.  The newly released Nod to Bob2 is just old and tired, without a single cut which I would look forward to listening to again.

I bought this CD pre-release.  It's like that old line from the movie, ""Hey, you screwed up.  You trusted us.""  Never again.

Disc is defective. We were really looking forward to hearing this CD but it is defective. It will not play at all. There's a noticeably darker ring at the outer edge and an odd pattern across the face. I am trying to contact the seller for a replacement.,0
"Don't wait for the inspiration, it will come to you when 'Covers' begins. What a cool album, and such a unique sound. The opening song 'covers' caught my attention in a coffee shop. I asked a worker: ""What is this song?"" I was told within a minute, and purchased The Moonlight Butterfly within the day.

The bass lines are penetrating, prodding, and this forms the BASSis for their sound. The guitar is light, airy and sparse. This does not mean it is easy to play. Making music this good takes talent. These guys have been around for years. Why have I not heard of them before?

Highly recommend.",1
"One of their best new  songs This is my third favorite song (after ""Shake""and ""Pink and Purple"") of the Shook Twins music.  I have listened to all of their songs (some only 30 seconds as they just came out), and this song is really a winner.  Great singing combined with good guitar and banjo as well as a couple other instruments create a positive audio experience.  It's an upper kind of song, so if you are not in the best of moods, this song may uplift you to a better place.  Anyway, it works for me.",1

This is just really relaxing music for me. I have a CD called Zen that I love to listen to and now I have added this to my favorites to play to relax and read with around. I am sure its great for massage therapist and yoga instructors to.  Probably great for meditation.  If your looking for relaxing but not over the top this is it. It might even help you fall asleep if you want to use it in that manner. I use other CD's for sleeping though. I love it and hope you do to. Listen to the samples before purchasing. I am not sorry at all that I bought this. It is great on my Kindle!,1
"An album full of beautiful playing and peace I've really enjoyed Todd Walton's other works so I received this in great anticipation and was not disappointed - it's just brilliant. There is a quality to the playing that creates atmosphere, space and peace. The playing is always interesting, surprising, lovely, never repetitive. And Todd has the gift of phrasing so beautifully - it's not just what he plays, it's what he doesn't play too, the space he leaves in the music keeps me drawn in, listening closer, creating a certain intimacy which to me is so special.

I love putting this cd on - it breathes the spirit of the player. Thank you Todd.

This is highly recommended.",1
Five Stars my favorite tune,1

"Long Time coming! An awesome collection of Tim's own heart and country soul.  Those of us that know him ... Know that he can play and perform anything from Garth Brooks to Pink Floyd. (And do it well!) His own 18+ compositions are what defines him as a great songwriter. This album is just a taste. Looking forward for ""What A Heart Ache Sposed Ta Do""... ""Extra-ordinary Man"" and ""Rabbit Run.""  You won't be disappointed. So spread the word ....He's on Amazon! I Hope Toby's Big Dog finds him!",1

"Hard Rock Music Nothing to do with Dragon Age Game I was sorely disappointed in this album, it's just a hard rock album that uses the Dragon Age name! Yes, I should have been tipped off by the fact they have cover art different from the game's, I thought maybe it was an ""inspired by"" album, but it is nothing like any of the game's music. heck, in my estimation, even as rock music goes, it was nothing special!",0
Five Stars Awesome - love it!,1
"Cuts Off at the End I would give this no stars if I could.  This is a long version of Electric Worry.  It is a nice version of the song, but it cuts off during a keyboard solo, so you don't get to hear all of the song.  The iTunes version is the same and also cuts off at the same place.  You can find other versions on the web and convert those to MP3.",0

"Definitely not Raymond Watts, and horrible to boot! Not only is this not Pig, it is ridiculously bad music! As I listened to the corny and uninspired opening track and marveled at the poor singing and the vapid lyrics, all I could think of was my little cousin, who, at age five, announced his yet-to-be-formed rock band would be called The Beatles. Informed that the name had been spoken for many decades prior, he replied ""yeah, but we can be the OTHER Beatles"". Ultimately, the biggest irony is that my five-year-old cousin had a better chance of living up to his ""borrowed"" band name than this clown ever could.",0

"Beautiful interpretation! Great detail. Beautiful tone. I don't usually play pieces like this one, I do more romantic, contemporary classical pieces.

"An enjoyable 50 minutes of pure escapism Ernest Reyer (1823-1909) is most famous for his operas, in particular the Wagner-inspired Sigurd, which has received a couple of recordings  the later opera Salammbo has been performed since Reyers death, too, but I am not aware of any complete recording. Well, Le Slam, a symphonie orientale in five tableaux for soloists, choir and orchestra, is an earlier work, having been completed in 1850, and there isn't much Wagner on display here. Instead, it is a splendid example of the orientalism popular in France (and elsewhere) at the time; those things wouldnt fly well these days, of course, but I bet there are more people than me who (secretly or not) enjoys the lush, magical atmospheres of many of these orientalist works. The clearest parallel in Reyers case is of course Felicien Davids contemporaneous Le Dsert, which it resembles in style and atmosphere, even though Reyer claimed not to have heard Davids work when he composed his own.

The symphony (or whatever you choose to call it) is in any case a very enjoyable affair, with pilgrims, djinns, sorcerers, shepherds and soldiers getting their turns, and much beautiful, magical scenery paintings. Overall, however, the work is surprisingly restrained  the music is tuneful, but generally gently rocking and slowly building atmosphere; even the orchestration is generally transparent and only rarely veering toward bombast or clutter. I suppose that the material is ultimately not deeply memorable (no Lakm, this), but it is certainly enjoyable and appealing as long as it lasts.

Le Slam comes coupled with expected and, in this context, completely uninteresting excerpts from Bizet (Pecheurs) and Richard Strauss (Salome). Being thoroughly familiar with both operas, I don't think I have ever bothered to even listen to the excerpts here, and I doubt many interested in this release would care either. Reyers work lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the disc is still worth its price, however. As for the performances, I suppose on could imagine somewhat more polished ones. The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Guido Maria Guida plays well, and the soloists and chorus are generally good, but lacks that last ounce of polish and finesse to always fully transport the listener to the magical realm Reyer is trying to conjure up for us (this is pure escapist music, after all), but I suppose that is also to some extent Reyers own fault. The recorded sound is a bit recessed; it is also a live recording , so you get the occasional cough and shuffle. Still, an enjoyable release, well worth checking out.",1

"Finally, a female rock artist that rocks. Guitar, drums, vocals, attitude - that's rock 'n roll. Great energy in these songs. The artist has power and attitude in her vocals, definitely a trained vocalist. The lead guitar is killer and very skilled. The songs have a modern sound with an 80's influence.

"This band is awesome! if you love the blues, this band should be on your must-listen list. Having recently joined up in 2010 with Christy Rossiter as lead singer, the whole band ROCKS. Very talented lead guitar player Michael Beebe invokes Jimi Hendrix, and drummer JE van Horne is superb.",1

"Chris Potter - Big Band - Swingin' Post Bop Overview:
On ""Transatlantic"" Chris Potter switches gears from the small group bands he has been working with and crosses the Atlantic to lead a big band in Denmark.  Chris Potter composed all the songs on the album and conducts the performance by the 18 piece ""DR Big Band"".  Chris Potter also shows off his top of the line sax soloing skills on most of the tunes.  I'm not familiar with the musicians that make up the ""DR Big Band"", but I believe that they are from Denmark.  The music on the album is fairly straight-forward swinging post bop.  It does not get quite as wild as some of Potter's contemporary big band leaders (e.g. Hollenbeck, JD Argue).  However, the songs are quite interesting with many intertwining parts.  Potter, who in my opinion is one of top soloists today, has many blistering solos throughout.  This is one of Potter's best recordings to date.  The big band is the perfect backdrop for his fiery solos.

Song Highlights:
The Steppes - My guess is this tune is inspired by the Central Asia Steppes region.  It has a worldly tinge and reminds me of some classical pieces written by Russian composers about this part of the world.  There is a nice solo by guitarist ""Per Gade"" on this tune.

Rumination - This tune opens with a reflective Monkish statement by Potter and pianist Magnus Hjort.  It quickly segues into an upbeat, funky interlude where the drums and bass remind me a bit of something you might hear in a Super Marios game soundtrack.  Over the top of that backdrop are some nice sweeping horn lines.  About half way through the drums speed up and get frantic and so does Potter's solo.

Quick - This tunes opens up with a staccato brass and drums line.  After a few bars the reeds come in with an intertwining line.  After a few more bars the piano, bass and guitar nicely blend in.  This is a terrific opening to the tune and the album.",1
"Excellent This CD is awesome, every song on it. These players are hot that Chris has on the CD. Without I doubt this is well worth the money.",1
"background music = AWFUL The flute playing is okay, but for crying out loud lady PLEASE hire a new arranger to put together your accompaniment!  Being a huge Madonna fan, I know how to play this song backwards & forwards, on the piano, and every single chord exactly and precisely.  Your instrumentalist's chords were ALL sorts of wrong, in more than half the duration of this track.  A total embarassment!  Next time study the original version of the song your'e covering MUCH much more closely, so your end result won't sound so squirmingly bad compared to the way the chords were actually written & performed.  Sorry!",0

WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND FOUND THIS DEAD RECORD As a Hendrix fan I bought this because of the famous guest appearances. What a shame the recording is so sloppy and Hendrix's playing too. Jim Morrison staggers onto the stage grabs a mic and slurs profanity and grunts and miscellaneous rubbish for way too long and the other 'featured' guests are just as pointless as Hendrix himself. Not an essential album for any collection. It seems it was released on the backs of the artists therein and a quick money-spinner for the label.,0

not up to Jack`s usual standard This was one album I could have done without.  Whoever dreamed it up must have been in a stupor.  The songs seem to have been chosen to please composer friends rather than make a good album.  Very few of the selections appealed to me although the singing and orchestrations were okay.  Love Jack Jones hate this album.  POOR CHOICE OF MATERIAL.  The Kapp recordings were the best.  Only a few of the early RCA albums appealed to me. Jack`s great recordings were already behind him when he signed on with RCA. Without Her (RCA) is excellent but this one was bad news.,0

Note:  I managed to glean Victor 78 record numbers via Joel Whitburn's POP MEMORIES 1890-1954 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-Memories-1890-1954-The-History-of-American-Popular-Music/dp/0898200830/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music</a>&nbsp;and an old edition of L. R. Dock's 78 RPM price guide&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Premium-Record-Guide-1915-1965-78-s-45-s-and-LP-s/dp/0896890546/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Premium Record Guide: 1915-1965: 78's, 45's and LP's</a>.  I'm reasonably certain of the recording/record match, but it's on a best guesstime based on date of recording matching the record release a few weeks/months later.

All the tracks on this Lp are electrical recordings (post-March, 1925), excepting acoustic ""Wang Wang Blues"" from Whiteman's earliest sessions in late 1920.

Per the liner notes, the musicians in the sessions include Bix Beiderbecke, the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby), Frankie Trumbauer, Jimmy Dorsey, Red Nichols, Bunny Berigan, Eddy Lang, and Jack Teagarden.  Mildred Bailey does vocals on ""Rockin' Chair"" and ""Stop the Sun Stop the Moon.""

Lp has great liner notes, two full columns.  This Lp concentrates on Whiteman's later 1920s-early '30s jazzier material; ""Mississippi Mud"" is the most jazzy track on the album.  ""Wang Wang Blues"" ain't bad, from Whiteman's early period.

I bought the Lp to get an example of Whiteman's recordings for Victor, after picking up a copy of a Potato Head Columbia Lp, CL 2820, and being informed by my shellac friend that Whiteman's best known hits were on Victor, not the Columbia cuts.  CD reissues of material this old tends to be legal boots (European expired copyrights) often taken from well-used private collections several (shellac transfer) generations down from the A&R masters, while I'm reasonably certain these two RCA Victor Vintage albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Whiteman-Volume-1-LP-Vintage-Series-1968/dp/B00124WUTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Whiteman Volume 1 LP Vintage Series 1968</a>&nbsp;are sourced from the original masters at Whiteman's original recording label when he was at the height of his commercial powers.  Sound is remarkably clear and sprightly.  I was surprised, while playing these tracks, that I found them more jazz musically satisfying than Glenn Miller's slow romantic recordings (eh, boring would be the word), even accounting for the relatively staid dance beat and rinky-dinky '20s - early '30s arrangements.

Whiteman's recording periods can be broken down as follows:

Victor 1920 to mid-1925 acoustic recordings.
Victor electrical recordings from mid-1925 (about 78s' series mid-19550 or so)
Columbia ""Potato Head"" releases from mid-1928 to mid-1931 (Bing Crosby and Bix Beiderbecke at their peak)
Victor 1931-36.

Record series for the 1931-36 period break down to the following approximate dates:
Victor 22998 - June, 1932
Victor 24089 - August, 1932
Victor 24365 - September, 1933
Victor 24455 - November, 1933
Victor 25151 - November, 1935",1
"wonderful curiosities super rarities,my type is getting old. we really need a cd!!!!",1
"Bootleg CD !! When I opened the case I saw everything was written in Chinese!!  Even the insert with the words to the songs -- Chinese!!  Then, I played the CD.  There are two songs that play twice.  If this isn't a bootleg CD I don't know what is!!  I'm totally disillusioned with Amazon for allowing this to be sold by them.  Oh, and I did not want to give this even one star, but unfortunately I was not able to get to this dialog box without giving it at least one star.  I guess I now know better than to buy CD's from Amazon!!",0
"2 good tracks. I bought this album when I was a poor, starving college student because music was always better than food.  Boy, did I feel ripped off.

White Bird-a short, uninspired version of It's A Beautiful Day's greatest hit. It is only 4 minutes long and not that interesting. It is a pointless remake. It was only included so stupid fans like me would buy the album.

Hot Summer Day-another It's A Beautiful Day classic. This is a seven minute version, with a really interesting, spacy instrumental in the middle. It reminds of Pink Floyd's Echos. The singing isn't on par with the original version, but the music is more interesting.

Swept Away is a jazz fusion instrumental similar to what Jean Luc Ponty or Michael Urbaniak would do. It is very nice, but not up there with the best of Ponty.

Easy Woman is a lounge act song. It sounds like something Tom Jones would do or like the theme song to the Love Boat.

This Man is kind of disco a number.

Baby Be Wise is like a combination of Easy Woman and This Man.

Spirit of America sounds like something Kansas would do, with a little Bruce Springsteen and John Wayne thrown in.

This is really not an album worth getting, but if you do, you will get a nice, spacy Hot Summer Day.
Hal Wagnet, from the first It's A Beautiful Day album, plays bass on some of the tracks.
The back up singer is called Dominque DelaCroix. Her real name was Linda. She ended up marrying David LaFlamme, and became the second Linda LaFlamme. She is not to be confused with the first Linda LaFlamme. The first Linda was responsible for writing much of the great music on the first It's a Beautiful Day album. She also sang and played keyboards. She left the group, and David, after the first album.
After the Linda split from David, David was not as successful at writing songs. After the first album, all the best It's A Beautiful Day songs were written by Fred Webb, who replace Linda on keyboards. Patty Santos replaced Linda on vocals, and It's A Beautiful Day recorded four more albums. For some reason, Santos was not on the first album even though she was an original member of the group.  On the last album, Today, David had left the group. Fred Webb and Patty Santos both died later.

It's A Beautiful Day has constantly been fueding with their original manager over the rights to the group's name and music. For this reason, the It's A Beautiful Day albums were taken off the market and have become very rare.  But, you can now get them and also some wonderful live albums.

David and the second Linda stayed together and have been performing since the late seventies. Currently they are performing under the name David and Linda LaFlamme, IABD, formerly known as It's A Beautiful Day. Val Fuentes, the original drummer from It's A Beautiful Day is also in IABD.",0
"Needs Accompaniment! It's just the artist playing on most selections. I have just seen her live in concert and was exciting about hearing more from Grace. But, I was disappointed. She is a young, exceptional artist who needs to get back up musicians to accompany her recordings. I would not recommend this CD at all!",0
You won't be disappointed with this. You can never go wrong with Willcox and ASMF.  They have been a superior team for generations.  Always exacting in their recordings.,1
Oldie but Goodie This is still the best performance of Vaughn Williams's Old One hundredth.  I only wish we could reassemble the musicians to make a contemporary recording using today's fine digital equipment.,1
This is not one for the Marine Band's best recording. The fidelity is not very good This is not one for the Marine Band's best recording. The fidelity is not very good. The mic placement was awful.,0
"An original Talented young Woman She writes the songs and delivers them in a smoky sultry voice. Wonderful and personable live.
Decidedly bossa nova infused, Hailing from the Twin Cities, she belongs in the heat of the limelight.",1
Five Stars New songs sound good!!,1
"Beautiful singing of the spirituals I love I wasn't familiar with Izez Matthews when I bought this CD. Unfortunately there's not a biography included with the insert and I haven't had much luck finding a lot of information otherwise. Her voice is warm, rich and beautiful. She projects complete understanding of the music, the style in which it should be performed, and the power of simplistic interpretation and delivery. My favorite interpreters of Spirituals are by Marion Anderson, Leontyne Price, Shirley Verrett, Florence Quivar and Robert McFerrin, Sr. Inez Matthews is right on their heals.

It was a real pleasure to listen to the recording with one exception. ""Fix Me Jesus"" has a terrible echo and that must be the fault of the engineers who remastered this recording. Otherwise the sound of the voice is excellent. The piano is a bit distant but that's probably the fault of the original recording.

In all, outstanding performances of America's best authentic folk music. Call them what you like, negro spirituals, slave songs or African-American concert spirituals, the music  comes right from the gut and that's how it should be performed.",1
Great band Love this group. Ww so excited to in a cd with this song. I wish they had more songs available on cd,1
Roll Tide Love it.made it my ring tone,1
"This is a completely forgotten album that really has some great songs on it I found this record at a thrift shop not really knowing anything about this artist. I was just excited to find a North Carolina native folk singer/songwriter. This is a completely forgotten album that really has some great songs on it. The guitar playing style is unique and beautiful at times. The lyrics are simple and he does not take himself too seriously which is refreshing. Have not been able to find out any information about this artist online. If you run across this album , buy it! it is a hidden gem.",1
One Star Hate it,0
"Buy it! This song is absolutely tear-jerking! Whenever I hear it, my eyes water. Daughter's great voice and her amazing acoustics make this song rhythmically mesmerizing while her applicable lyrics make me reflect on my troubled past. Nonetheless, I love this song and highly recommend it!",1
"Perfect Great record, arrived super quick, no issues",1
Sorry I bought it! This sounds  as though it was recorded from 78rpm records. The scratchiness almost drowns out the music! Wish I hadn't bought it.,0
"Disappointing Theo Adam was a great singer, but this album does not do him justice. The Lieder represented do not show his marvelous voice to good advantage.",0
Five Stars excellent,1
. The Amazon mp3s are almost always cheaper than those on iTunes but can be imported automatically. Why buy anywhere else?,1
"Ray Manzerek with the Stooges I love this recording, Have purchased it twice, but doesn't have Ray Manzerek's organ solo like the sound clip does.  Help!  I want this version!",0
"Not impressed This album is example of putting all the perfect ingredients together and coming up with a less then spectacular result.

The material John choose covers some of Peter Allen's best songs and John's voice is pleasant.  What is missing is emotion.  There is absolutely nothing that brings one into the song's stories.  Peter Allen himself was not a terrific singer, but like many songwriters before him, usually has the listener identify with what he wrote.  It feels as if John is trying to be too technically correct and as a result, delivers a nicely gift wrapped box with nothing in side.",0
Two Stars Slow it down.... humans barely have time to catch a breath!,0
"Too Fast The tempo is way too fast, and it really is not very usable. Dynamics are virtually non existent.",0
One Star Ouch.,0
"Too fast I wasn't able to use this music, as I felt that the tempo was too fast for this particular song, and it lacked dynamics.",0
"dele menos vaya, raza fo christ!  ud. no tienen variedad en tu music.  el unico canto bueno es ""verdades descubiertas"", los demas son algo aburridos, aunque la letra es chilero.  pero da dolor de cabeza escucharlo por mucho tiempo.

ud. traten demaciado duro ser como los demas, y la sena q aquel hace con su mano en the cover no tiene nada de bueno",0
Luv it! Outstanding mix of songs.,1
"Ledisi! Ledisi This is a beautiful song and quite frankly, I cannot get enough of this enormously talented singer and her work!",1
Four Stars Real good tune,1
"Old School, ""folky"" blues tune - guitar playing along ... Old School, ""folky"" blues tune  - guitar playing along the lines of Mississippi John Hurt.  I'd forgotten all about this recording until working on  a tax return for a couple who had just separated....",1
"subconscious surf ""Monsters From the Id,"" like The Coffin Daggers eponymous debut, takes Neo-Surf to a new level.  Until recently, their albums were only available in MP3, but this one is available again on CD.

Personnel:  Victor Dominicis aka Viktor Venom (guitar, theremin, echoplex); Eudocia Rodzinak (guitar, piano, organ); Peter Klarnet (bass); David Varriale (drums).

One of the best tracks is the cover of ""A Shot in the Dark"" from the Blake Edwards film of the same name.  The Coffin Daggers would be a natural for soundtracks for films like ""Pulp Fiction.""  The songs sometimes start off with a simple riff you've heard before, then take off in a completely different direction.  By the time you're halfway into it, you don't know where it's all going to wind up.  There's a lot of talent here.

If you download MP3s, download legal MP3s.  Illegal downloads can kill a band like this.  The Coffin Daggers have some videos on YouTube--shoestring productions, but they're interesting.

I hope this band achieves the success it deserves, and ""Monsters From the Id"" isn't the last we hear from them.",1
Cute song not just for kids Heard this on WGBH & loved it!,1
Five Stars Nice head bobbin music.,1
"This is in the wrong category.  It is Rap Music. This seems to be in the wrong category.  In the search box I entered, ""chamber music for horns"", and clicked the play button.  Notice it says explicit.  Maybe nasty is more correct.  It is clearly unlike any chamber music you have ever heard.  It is what could be called unusually bad Rap Music.  What do you think?  Did they give it the chamber music title so it would shock people?  So...it seems it will not sell much, as...well...people looking for chamber music will be appalled (but maybe that was the point)!",0
Just bought this song for my sister... ... Just bought this song for my sister... why is amazon requiring me to download amazon music? I wish it could be downloaded as mp3 files. But they didn't email me the mp3 files. Hopelessly irritating!!!!,0
very pleased I heard Mr. Salomon sing this song live and I imidiately fell in love with it and had to purchase it to listen to it anytime I wish. :),1
"Great! Audio quality is excellent! The song is great, another example of the versatility that Incubus has. Exactly as was expected.",1
"This is Incubus?  Sounds Terrible guys! Well after watching this song sung live in Germany today (6/17/2011).....the crowd's reaction pretty much went EXACTLY along with my feelings on this song.  They cut to a girl's face and she was mid yawn.  Ya, this song is terrible....it doesn't even remotely sound like the Incubus we know and love.  Sounds like a Top 40 pop song made so my 55 year old mom could enjoy herself a little smooth listening.  The only difference is this song will NEVER break the Top 100.  I'm a 10+ year Incubus fan that's met the band and been to 5-6 concerts.  This song is a HUGE disappointment.  The rest of the CD is reported to sound very very similar.  After listening to the new Foo Fighters CD today I just had to have it.  Classic music by an amazing band.....I'm not even a huge fan of theirs.  What I do respect is sticking to their roots and producing a sound they knew their fans would enjoy.  Maybe Incubus needs to take a page out of their book.",0
"What happened ? It's an ok song but what happened to Incubus ?
They're becoming top 40 adult pop or something.
I hope the remainder of this album is ALOT better as I pre-ordered it based some of on my other Incubus albums. Even light grenades had some(although very little) edge to it, but from the first 2 releases off of this album i don't see it at all.
Not even as edgy or upbeat as ACLoTM or Morning View and no where near SCIENCE and Make Yourself.
Probably won't pre-order the next one i'll just wait until i can preview it before I order it this easy listening or light grenades incubus just don't cut it.",0
"3rd movement is incomplete Buyers beware, the last movement is incomplete (it's only 2:56, should be 8:40).  The music stops in the middle of the movement.  I am trying to contact Amazon regarding this issue, but it seems nearly impossible to contact them regarding digital content.",0
great version great version plays in end credits of Goodwill Hunting,1
One Star I didn't purchase this faggoty song!,0
Good listening Beautiful,0
"Best Cover Ever! Granted, TI's original ""Whatever"" is a pretty good Hip Hop, but wait til you hear Amaru's version.  Great Rock version here by Bobby Amaru and as usual, he hits a home run in song production, quality, melody and style.  This is that one tune you'll be singing all day and annoying everyone around you....but you'll be thinking, ""So what dude, this rocks!""",1
Five Stars Great pop song!!,1
Five Stars good,1
"My favorite Foster The People song I heard this song one day on Pandora and thought it kind of sounded like he was singing about God.  It was a love song, so I wasn't certain.  So, I traversed the interwebs and sure enough I found it was.  I thought this was actually really cool.  I'm not super religious, but I like how the song could have a double meaning and could trick people into thinking it's about one thing when it's really about something else.

This song then brought me to the entire Torches album and I thought it was just brilliant and now I can't get enough of the band and the rest is history.

"Big Fat Lie The composer Mamoru Samuragochi today admitted that he used a ghostwriter. Everything turned out to be a fake. What a shame. He did great damage to the community, telling everybody that he composed in spite of having lost his hearing. Hailed as ""The Beethoven of Our Times"" by the press...",0
"Import priced, but well worth it. Saw an NHK (Japan) documentary on Samuragochi (unusual family name) and was impressed not only by his artistry but the physical challenges he endures just to live day to day.  He is self-taught as a composer, did a stint as a video game music writer, and somehow managed to tap into the universe of tone, pitch, harmony, rhythm, and duration to present us with profoundly soulful music.  It is my hope that his work will be released in the US so that it is more widely shared among those engaged in probing the human experience.",1
Gold a song made for us lovers of rock and roll.  I love it.,1

"Excellent CD from original singer/songwriter! In the summer of 2011, I took my first trip to Nashville, TN. As a huge country music fan, I had heard of the legendary Bluebird Cafe. Upon arriving early afternoon and settling my things into the hotel room, my traveling companion and I saw a couple of things downtown, had lunch, and then ventured out to the Bluebird Cafe.

There were 4 songwriters in the round. Among them was a beautiful young lady with a radiance about her that immediately captivated me before I heard her sing. The first song she sang was Ruby Red. Any song that references the classic film The Wizard of Oz is ok in my book. I was hooked instantly. This young artist was Jessica Rae.

Upon her second round, she unleashed a powerhouse song of sorrow, redemption, grace, and hope called 24 Hour Church in Memphis. My companion and I stood there jaws agape at this beautiful song. We were fortunate enough to hear several other songs from this artist and when it was over, we purchased both CDs that she had available.

This CD is raw, poignant, real, stirring, playful, and is still frequently played here. There isn't a single bad track on the album. From the first song (24 Hour Church) to the closing track, this album took this listener on a journey through both the simplicities and complications that life has to offer. Jessica Rae has a way of coining a lyric and then vocally delivering a song in a way that is reminiscent of  Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, and Buddy Miller.

Jessica Rae is no ingenue. She is a seasoned and superbly talented artist who could easily stand equal among more seasoned veterans. This CD should be a part of any collection belonging to fans of country music as well as fans of singer/songwriters. She also blends in hints of rock and roll, folk, and gospel and pulls off each track with soaring confidence and immeasurable vocal control.

I was fortunate to be part of her Kickstarter campaign for her new release, Freedom Avenue. I received my copy shortly before the first of the year and it instantly became one of my Best of 2013 selections for my own collection. While some of the magic from the self-titled CD seems to be missing, the lyrics are strong and the delivery is impeccable. I enjoy all the songs on Freedom Avenue and it's a good, solid CD. Jessica Rae hits all the marks. I will not be surprised when a national record exec realizes what a superb talent she has and makes her a nationally renowned artist. She clearly has the chops and her music deserves to be heard on a much larger scale.

Do yourself a favor, pick up this CD and Freedom Avenue when it becomes available. I guarantee you will have no regrets.",1
"Not the ""Clean"" version, as the album title would ... Not the ""Clean"" version, as the album title would have you believe. ""B!tch I'm a Star"" is still very much in the song.",0

"Sadly was disappointed Listened to the samples and it all seemed good. But of course they are only seconds long.

"Grrrr!!! The men of Max Q are some of the best singers in the entire Barbershop world.  They all hail from vocal excellence in The Vocal Majority.  They all have gold medals from their many many appearances in championship quartets and choirs.  WHY THE HELL DID SOME LOSER IDIOT PRODUCER INSIST ON USING AUTO TUNE!  For example, at the end of Steppin"" Out With My Baby, the pathetic pitch correction makes these giants of the harmonic 7th world, sound like mice.  It's flat out sickening.  I just can't listen to this mess, especially when I know that they would have sounded just fine without resorting to the crutches used by the rest of the ""musical"" world. Perhaps it was prophecy when in 2007, they sang ""This time we almost sang our songs in tune.""  Many of these tracks sound like these simply spoke the words, and let the audio engineers bend them into harmony.

C'mon guys, you can do better.

Two stars because some of the arrangements are great, too bad we didn't get to hear anyone sing them.",0
it is simply amazing what 99 cents will buy these days in the ... it is simply amazing what 99 cents will buy these days in the way of amazing music on Amazon!!!

This one might have been in one of the Godfather movies .. what do you think?,1
"Porcupine Tree meets Pink Floyd and hangs with Riverside. Excellent album.

What I love about Sky Architect is that they clearly know when to amp up the rocking, and when to chill out.
The first song on the album is slower, but serves as mood-setting for the next, and so on.  The climax occurs at ""The Breach,"" which couldn't get better.",1

"Club David I am an advent listener and supporter of Gospel Rap and Holy Hip Hop and have long been a fan of Fedel.  Now, I thought ""Get Live"" was hot, but on the real, this cd is not hot...it is straight FIRE!!!!! I am already on track 9 of 13 and I have not skipped one track and have enjoyed each one! Each track just seems to flow into the other increasing the intensity.  If you like those hard Southern Bangers, this is truly the cd for you, but more importantly, this is Jesus music and God is being glorified and praised in every track! Godly lyrics, banging beats, flawless flows, great features and nice hooks; what more can you want from in my opinon, a 5 Star album!!!! This cd will be in constant rotation!!! Keep the movement going Fedel!! All I can say now is ""Hale, Hale..Hale, Hale..now Work It Out"" and get this cd!",1
"Does not do the legend justice Al Harris's song ""The Ballad of Kate Shelley"" is passable as far as old backwoods folk songs go. Harris's singing is very monotone and the songwriting sounds more like he's reciting the text of the story as opposed to singing about a legend, aka. Woody Guthrie's rendition of ""John Henry""
Scott and Michelle Dalziel's interpretation of the Kate Shelley legend is far superior and more enjoyable to listen to.",0

"My Old Man a wonderful classic! This is my very first Father's Day and I just requested this wonderful song to be played on the local public folk music show. I heard it years ago and it stuck in my head and heart forever, and the connections run so deep for me. In a powerful, warm voice like a timeless sage, John McCutchen recalls his dad, of Pittsburgh steelworker, and lover of the Pirates. I lost my dad in '02 and think about him every day, and he loved the Pirates, Roberto Clemente and Steelers so much, and never moved from the small Western Pa. town where he was born and became a pillar of the community. Thanks John McCutchen for this classic! My little boy is only three months old, but I just filmed him in his little crib with this song playing in the background. He's remember his grandfather and namesake this way, and then his own dad who plans to take him to many more baseball games. God Bless!",1

"what are you waiting for? its another solid album by Poorsport! Over time, I have heard a lot of different music by many different artists, and I have to say Poorsport is one of the best bands I've ever heard. Their lyrics are clean, and the music will be stuck in your head a lot. (which is a good thing) I would have to say they are pros at writing lyrics, and the music itself.

So here you are, looking at this album, wondering if you should buy it or not. The answer? YES! This is one of their best albums. If you want to get into Punk music but don't know where to start, you should get this first. End of story.",1
Five Stars I love it,1
Five Stars shes my favorite Italian singer of all time,1
bad recording The volume is really low and you have to turn laptop volume up fully and the it is still a real low volume. The quality of the recording is very poor. Scratch an distorted all the way through. Definitely do not buy this one. I am looking for a better recording elsewhere. It was only .99 cents us so it wasn't about the wasted dollar. I just didn't  get anything but junk for my money,0

"5 Really Good Songs. The rest... I dunno...? There are about five really good songs on the total album. Overall, it feels a bit drab & depressed. I'm not sure what the audio artist was going though when writing, but the majority of the songs offer little hope or happiness.

I give it 4-stars, still, because those five tunes are so groovy and easy to dance & daydream to. Plus, I believe taste is subjective at best and those other tunes weren't that bad from a logical perspective, just an emotional one.",1
Too much romanticizing of classical period master pieces Beethoven's music is in classical period with well defined structures and tempos. The play tries very hard to romanticize the pieces. Too much rubato. Stops are too long and arbitrary.,0
"Five Stars Beautifully played, this version is top notch!",1
"Great track, but doesn't play but the first 1 ... Great track, but doesn't play but the first 1 min 20 seconds on the amazon player for Android through the cloud.
Wish amazon would fix their stuff..",0
"Dope beats and lyrically delicious. I choose a five star because a friend turned me on to young jeezy by way of my Amazon's Mp3 player today. Great recommendation (Gangsta Music) it's lyrically exotica.  Jeezy had me bobbing my head, and then gifted it to my badass son Zane.  By the way kindled audio kicks.",1
One Star Thought it was a different song,0
"Better than the original This version of ""Dust in the Wind"" is even better than Kansas' original version.  The vocals aren't quite as crisp (as is typical of ""live"" versions), but the strings from the symphony more than make up for it.  Give it a listen!",1
Five Stars Great jam.,1
"For serious collectors only The official remaster of Deserter's Songs is AWESOME.  Even if you already own the record the re-mastering job is good enough to warrant a new purchase.  However I wish this was included as bonus tracks and not a full priced release.

This is the album without vocals.  Not remixed, nor re-balanced.  Just the album minus vocals.  I get the idea of why they would do this, as there are so many beautiful things happening on this record.  But they also did a lot of panning and balancing of the instrumental tracks to fit around the vocals.  With the vocals gone these elements should have been re-balanced to stand on its own as an instrumental release.  As they are charging full price this seems completely reasonable.  It is a shame, as the opportunity to hear all of the amazing orchestrations on songs like ""Opus 40"" and ""Tonite it Shows"" are such a treat.",0
"A player to watch I really enjoy David's playing. Reflections of Themes is a much more polished production than his first cd, True Intent. His tone is very nice and his playing is fluid. If you're a fan of instrumental rock guitar in the vein of Satriani you should check out David Stockden. This cd also features Stu Hamm on bass on one track which is killer.",1
"A singer's singer, a songwriter's songwriter. No one like him. His vocals, his writing, his arrangements, it's all unmistakably Drew. So good to know his health issues have subsided and let him get back to his obvious love of music. Keep it up Drew.",1
This is a great song. this is a great song. I especially enjoy it when riding my mountain bike through the trails. It's very motivational.,1
"I like it but it's not what I ordered I ordered this item specifically for the cover art to add to my collection. It arrived in a plain white paper sleeve. Not what I wanted at all, caveat emptor I guess. It was cheap so I'm not that bothered. But I wish I had the artwork...",0

Two Stars Did not care for these remixes....,0
Two Stars Repetitive. Too new age to be appropriate for hymns.,0
Five Stars The usual great songwriting from James McMurtry.,1
I have vol 1 which is the same as this ... I have vol 1 which is the same as this DVD except with more songs don't know why they call this Vol 2 as there is no new songs and it was the same concert very misleading!!,0
Great movie Great movie as advertised. The annimation was fantastic and the plot was unique. Everyone loves the music.,1
"Very dub/ambient Great album, very similar to Bonobo and/or Modeselektor in sound, great from start to finish. Very pleased with this purchase.",1
"Love it Discovered this artist on Pandora and had to buy the album. It's rare that I like every song on a CD, but this one is the exception. Great album I love it",1
"Kodomo - Frozen in Motion This is a great album, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. Similar to 'Still Life', Kodomo managed to make each song catchy and energetic while maintaining the airy ambiance that makes it so soothing to listen to. It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to when you're falling asleep at night and also when you're trying to wake up in the morning. Great stuff! (:",1

"The wings of the great bird, always cooled by the wind up there The wings of the great bird, always cooled by the wind up there. The sound of the great bird up there, searching for lonely people to devour. I love this song. It reminds me that tonight there will be less lonely people in the world than there were last night.",1
"Five Stars Simply amazing. Reminiscent of French composer, Satie's rhythmic progressive work. IMHO.",1
Two Stars Could help you catch a cold.,0
"What A Disappointment Everyone always say ""I love GLEE but ..."". Well, I now understand why. This recording is so poor that I've already deleted it. I cannot imagine what they must have been thinking with this poorly conceived recording. This sounds like a confusing mess with no stand out melody or hook. I must admit that there have been a few other songs by the members of GLEE that I didn't care for but never to the extent of deleting them.",0
"Don't waste your time or your money! I have been meditating and doing self guided meditation for years, and have listened to more than a few meditation/hypnosis recordings. Many of them are crap, but this one fills the whole toilet full of crap! I say that because Bruce Goldberg has made a career out of billing himself as a hypnotherapist and has become very famous after being promoted on shows like Coast to Coast AM. I have purchased several of his books and found some of the evidence for past lives intriguing, especially when combined with the evidence presented by other reincarnation researchers. He portrays himself as a very credible guy.

With that impression of him in my mind I decided that I would try one of his hypnosis audios. I went to his website first, and that should have been my first clue that this dude is a charlatan. His website was probably built in the late 90's or early 2000's. His proof videos are poor quality VHS recordings from 90's daytime TV shows of him ""regressing"" people. He's offering tapes and CD's. No digital downloads. Interestingly he provides the script for many of his self hypnosis tapes and I read a few of them. All of them start with a short induction about imagining a white light filling your body. Relaxing the tension in your feet, thighs, back, etc. (standard hypnotic induction) ""Play New Age Music for 2 minutes"" Then more script pronouncing that as he counts from 1 to 5 you will ascend to meet your Superconscious Self. So it's that easy, huh? I decided to give this guy a try, but I wasn't about to fork out $65 for a CD! I found an audio on Amazon for .99 cents.

I chose Overcome Procrastination, because I was honestly too embarrassed to pick one like, Make Contact with Aliens. I sat in my favorite mediation chair, put in my headphones and pressed Play. Immediately the crap began. There was no soft music introduction, no calm voice telling me to sit in a comfortable position, take a few deep breaths, some explanation as to the process of induction....just ""Sit back, relax, imagine a warm feeling moving into your toes and feet..take a deep breath etc. (and before I could even take a deep breath), imagine this warm feeling moving into your ankles etc. (and before I could take a deep breath)..same script about moving this feeling into your thighs, hands, back, etc. This process was rushed, and it was obvious he was just reading from the same script that was on his website. The audio quality is horrible. It sounds like he recorded it by placing a microphone next to the speaker on his TV that was playing a worn out VHS tape. Seriously.

I was so annoyed by the crappy induction by this so-called world renowned hypnotherapist that I wasn't even relaxed as the ""New Age Music"" started playing to get me into a deeper state. The ""music"" sounded like it was from the same VHS tape, only it was louder than the voice audio (so if I had been relaxed it would have jolted me out of it),and I think someone's kid was playing the xylophone with warbled piano music in the background. I'm assuming that this ""music"" was from the early 80's and what once constituted New Age Music (little hint Bruce: Update your stuff). Once that torture ended, there was obvious pasted audio of a different session of Bruce telling me to imagine myself going up in a hot air balloon. As he counted from 1 to 5 I would magically ascend to meet my Higher Self. Why didn't I think of that! Is it really that easy? And BAM! There I was, suddenly in contact with the entire Universe! Not eve close. By now I was pissed that I was wasting my time with this low quality, not relaxing, hypnosis session.

After more crappy music Bruce came on and quickly read a script about how I would now finish tasks, etc. I literally heard the pages turn as he was reading! No emotion, no empathy, just quickly reading from a script. All I was thinking was, ""What a great way to make money! Pronounce yourself a hypnotherapist, write a BS script, play some crappy music, tell me that I'm now in the 5th dimension, I'm awesome, all my problems are solved, etc., then count from 1 to 5 and I'm back in my body with all that progress.""

I never write reviews, and because of this fake I've already wasted too much of my life listening to his recording and writing this review, but this guy should not make one more dime selling his cheap, rehashed, 1980's crap!

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY (unless you want to either laugh or be aggravated beyond belief)",0
For Good (Glee) Disappointing version. I can't find the Glee Version I like. 2 guys were singing.,0
"Heavy Crunch Techno While most tracks here are slower in tempo than most techno ( a blessing and certainly what diffentiates this from the rest), they seem to my ears a little dull, yet, again miles above the standard.
What irritaes me most in techno is the tropes and everyone sounds the same. Very predictable with fast beats and boring, boring, boring major note or chord progressions.
Not so much so with Grouch, though he does delve into this stereotype, he doesn't wallow in it.
There is the dub (The Orb) and maybe a little jazz( Leftfield ). Yet...
It is that heavy,heavy bass riff and anarchic topping, slightly unpredictable tghat makes this a joy.
Top tracks to me are Octophlange, Monster, and Minimila.
Grouch has major PO.",1
Solid Chicano Christian Song It was easy for me to hear the sincerity behind Brother lg's convictions and love for Christ in this song.,1
Pick literally ANYTHING else by Fields Just to echo what some others have said here--do not take this album as representative of Fields' other fantastic work.  This album takes his wonderful vocals and craps all over them with house-esque beats and bad production.  Every single one of his other albums is better than this one.,0
"An ill-advised attempt at modernity Lee Fields should stick with the arrangements and instrumentation that he knows.  This album is a poorly executed attempt at updating Mr. Fields sound to something more like modern R&B and it fails miserably.  There's not a single song that is memorable and Mr. Fields' vocals sound terribly out of place.  The lyrics are trite.  The music is a horrible panache of differing styles and even the addition of some real keyboards and wah guitar on the last few songs can't elevate this album out of the morass of crapitude it exists in.

Prior to hearing this album, I would have said that I love Mr. Fields' work; now I have to say that I love most of his work.  This album is terrible and will get absolutely no more listening time from me; once was enough.

(I even removed it from my iTunes immediately after my post-rip listening session.)",0
"review In 1976 Eric Burdon recorded an album of new material with a reformed original Animals line-up.  Legal issues saw the collection shelved for two years so Burdon decided to return to a solo career.  Recruiting an all-star cast of friends and associates including Alex Korner and Zoot Money (who co-wrote the bulk of the album with Burdon), he went into London's Advision Studios, recording 1978's ""Survivor"" with former Animal Chas Chandler handling production chores.  Surrounded by a crew of this caliber and talent, you would have hoped for something inspirational from Burdon.  Didn't happen.  Instead the album showcased Burdon clearly looking for direction - was he a pop star ?  An R&B act ?  A rocker ?  Burdon clearly didn't know which way to turn.  The end result was a mishmash of an album that ended up pleasing nobody.  That was unfortunate since the collection exhibit flashes of true talent; especially when Burdon seemed to relax and let go of the 'tough guy' image he seemed so attached to.  Check out his performances on 'Hook of Holland' and 'P.O. Box 500' ...  fun and way more entertaining than anything else on the album.

- 'Rocky' was a surprisingly decent slice of conventional rock with Burdon finding a key that was both comfortable and attractive.  Picture the kind of stuff bands like Slade and Status Quo were churning out in the mid-1970s and you'll have a feel for this likable number.  rating: *** stars  YouTube has a clip of Burdon lip-synching the song on the German television program PopRock (love the enthusiastic German audience):[...]
- In contrast, the atmospheric ballad 'Woman of the Ring' was a more typical performance in that it aptly reflected the damage done to Burdon's voice.  Quite a pretty track, the main problem with this one was Burdon's frog croak of a voice.  You were left to wonder if he was actually going to make it through the whole song.  Kicking in at the end of the song, Maggie Bell's shrieky voice didn't help the track.  rating: *** stars
- Another Burdon-Money composition, 'The Kid' was another likeable mid-tempo rocker that again featured a Burdon talk-sing performance. P.P. Arnold added her shrill backing vocals to the mix and hearing the pair of them trying to out-yell one another was actually kind of fun.  rating: ** stars
- 'The Tomb of the Unknown Singer' found Burdon trying to do country-blues number...  Pompous and overblown, this one was just plain painful to sit through.  I never thought I'd catch myself saying something like this, but I'd rather hear a Kris Kristofferson LP any day of the week.  rating: * star
- 'Famous Flames' could have been a decent blues-rocker, but producer Chandler seemingly felt obligated to bury Burdon under waves of shrill female backing singers and an overly busy arrangement.  Oh well, this one was at least listenable.  rating: ** stars
- Hollywood Woman' was a catchy enough song, but some horrible lyrics and another strangled vocal wiped out whatever momentum was generated.  Taken from the same German television appearance referenced above, YouTube had a performance clip of the song: [...]  rating: ** stars
- Judging by the lyrics including the classic couplet ""she has a calculator up her red dress ..."" I'm guessing Burdon's affection for Amsterdam didn't have anything to do with the city's museums.  Giving credit where due, this was easily the album's stand out tune.  Burdon actually sounded engaged and as if he were having fun spitting this one out.  rating: **** stars
- Yeah, Burdon's always enjoyed his reputation as a blues singer, but to my ears his barebones acoustic cover of 'I Was Born To Live the Blues' was simply dull and plodding.  rating: * stars
- After the last blues number, virtually anything would have sounded good. 'Highway Dealer'' certainly wasn't any great shakes, but luckily the song included a tasty, jazz-tinged lead guitar solo.  rating: ** stars
- At least to my ears Burdon's always sounded better when he simply relaxed and didn't try too hard.  That was definitively the case on the closer 'P.O. Box 500'.  A rollicking rocker, Burdon sounded like he was having fun on this one and the results were one of the album's best performances.  rating: **** stars

Five Stars Perfect! Great album :-),1
One Star well it doesn't sound any good on vinyl. way too distorted.,0
"inject this This Vaccines was a big album in the eyes of many a few years ago.  Let's listen to it.

""Wreckin' Bar"" is a nice anthemic punk song.  Well it sure sounds like it's in the punk spirit.  Whether it's technically punk or not I haven't a clue!  It's catchy enough.  ""If You Wanna"" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It's really catchy and enjoyable.  ""But if you wanna come back it's alright it's alright, it's alright if you wanna come back!""  That's actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  ""Well I don't want to wake up in the morning but I've got to face the day, that's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!""

""A Lack of Understanding"" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good ""I've got too much time on my hands, but you don't understand or you won't understand"".  ""Blow It Up"" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there's enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  ""Wetsuit"" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The ""ah ah ah"" sounds like the 60's song by Dusty Springfield ""I Only Want to Be With You"".  Pretty decent melody either way.  ""You want to do things differently, you'll do them independently"".  I love the part ""Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!""

""Norgaard"" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  ""Her mind's made up she don't want to go steady she's only seventeen so she's probably not ready!"" is a funny line.  ""Post Break-Up Sex"" is another memorable rocker.  ""Leave it 'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs""  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it's a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  ""Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?""  VERY clever lyrics!

""Under Your Thumb"" is pretty decent pop/rock.  ""I don't mind about taking it slow, I'm perfectly aware of what I'm yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!""  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the ""Eleanor"" part in particular.  ""All In White"" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.

""Wolf Pack"" is perhaps the only song I'm not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it's missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  ""Family Friend"" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. ""You wanna get young but you're just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it's suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it's cool""  Also love the line afterwards ""Half baked girl hey I'm hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody's lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you're trying to get yourself back in, come on in"".

The hidden track, ""Somebody Else's Child"" is a short piano ballad of sorts.  I like how the piano gallops at times.  Touching moment of the album and drastically different from the faster punk/pop rock stuff.  This album deserves credit for the tight songwriting and strong lyrics.  It's a 5-star album alright.",1
"6 cuts only? The original disc has 11. Apparently, whomever decided to issue this, took only the first 6 off the album. Not good.",0
"More like Street Rap I am a huge fan of Christian rap.  I listen to guys like Lecrae, Trip. Tedashii, Flame, and more like them.  These guys however seems a little more ""street"".  I can't really describe what I meant by that, but either way this album is great!  If you like Christian rap, I would definitively give these guys a try!",1
"Brought back memories I was very young when Honey was popular, but I remember my Dad playing this album many times.  The song brought back some good memories of my childhood.",1
Definitely NOT Get Up This CD wouldn't play in my laptop.  It finally played off my PC and I don't know what to tell you.....it's definitely NOT Mac Miller's song Get Up ... Sounds techno.  Eck.....NOT HAPPY,0
"Bought it to use for practice I bought this MP3 so that I could practice singing along with it so that I can sing this song at church.  I don't know that the quality would be there to play live over a sound system-because I didn't try it.

It's a great thing to have so that you can see if you are compatible with the range of the song before buying the actual CD for performance use.",1
Not identical to Laura Story's recording After purchesing and downloading we realized that parts of the song were missing and it was identical the Laura Story's version on the radio. We ended up buying another soundtract at our local Family Christian Bookstore.  The good thing was it cost only .99,0
THanks!!! I love Tiger Army and Nick 13 ... thanks for having this so I could hear his gorgeous voice! TAND,1

"Nothing special here ""Blue Star"" by Seapony has a simple, pretty sound, but something about it just didn't sit entirely right with me.  Maybe I don't like the way the vocals seem to be buried under the music, especially the guitar.  I enjoyed the guitar bit, but I don't like it when the musical instruments in a song overpower the vocals like this.  It feels backwards, inside-out, unsettling, and makes it hard to follow the lyrics.  When I listen to a song, I prefer to know what it's about!  It's not a bad song, however, and I may well hang onto it.  Those who are less lyrically-oriented than I am in their enjoyment of music might actually enjoy it very much.",0
"Pleasant fuzziness This song by Seapony has a slightly blurred female vocal accompanied by a surf-ish solo electric guitar against a fuzzy layer of J&MC-ish electric guitar and bass noise.  As a group, their sound on ""Blue Star"" reminds me of a lighter version of the Breeders.  Anyway, setting aside all of the references for a moment, this tune is good enough to make me want to hear the full album.",1
5 Stars I love this song.,1
"too bad he's growing Sadly, the 4U EP was great pop music.  The track with Flo Rida should have been huge, and the followup, would have been a great follow up.  Sadly, they fell like a thud.  Here, we have CS with a deeper voice, and more of a techno sound.  Not good, not even memorable.  I am thinking Atlantic will drop him before they give give proper backing.  He actually has a stronger voice than the other BOY, but it doesn't matter, if the material is this weak.",0
Great version of this song. The best version of this song.,1
"Missing Song This song, ""Forgive Me John,"" was missing from my Jean Shepard album, so it is nice to be able to buy one or two songs rather than a complete album.",1

"Not the Ella I love... I was disappointed.  This record seems to be a ""young"" Ella-- before she developed the smokey undertones and range of expression  that made her so enchanting.

"Maggie Live! The music is Maggie--the sounds of feeling blue, sad and kinda angry.  Maggie's comments make it all the more personal.",1
"Slightly different, exhibits an untypical playfulness This is a lovely performance. Fedoseyev maintains a light touch, especially in the Andante and the Scherzo, which results in an almost playful feeling to the work; the somewhat brisker tempos contribute to that, no doubt.

The orchestra plays well and the sound is quite nice. This is taken from a live performance as there is a little audience noise apparent but nothing objectionable.

Refreshing to hear a performance that ventures something a bit different from the frequently staid and serious approach to Bruckner.",1
"Don't Look Back Purchased 'Don't Look Back (Fug Remix') after hearing it on Pandora and I haven't looked back! Nice vocals with an underlying beat which, to me at least, makes for great listening. Sounds super on a strong system with plenty of volume!",1

"Witty Lyrics & Fun Music Rigamortis: A Zombie Love Story is a movie musical about a zombie apocalypse yet it's also a love story.  The music is written by Greg Szydlowski & Dave Dewes and is funny, a little zany (""..flesh & chips and baby's feet...""), and also touching when it needs to be.  It's mostly rock/pop style with some good horror stings.  There are some memorable songs in it that are ringing in my head.  I see the movie already won one independent film award and I can see why from some of the music.  If you like funny, zany, and touching music, get the soundtrack.",1
not what I thought. the sample made it sound like it was really close to the song created for the trailer but after listening to it after download it was really off same flow of music but the intensity in some parts were much more toned down compared to the original and just was not what I was hoping it to be.,0

"Weird and Not Worth the Time Made a mistake purchasing music by this Arthur Brown - introverted and weird - really sick stuff IMO - there is beautiful music out there - this ain't it - avoid like the plague

"Get The Heather On The Hill I'm not a big fan of this album in its entirety, not because there's anything wrong with the performances, but because frequently, the arrangements seem ordinary.  The exception is The Heather On The Hill.  The song itself isn't special; just a straight-up Lerner & Lowe song from the 1947 musical Brigadoon.  What is special is this arrangement, which starts with a pulsing 16 bar intro (8 bars of solo bass, followed by 8 more bars of bass and piano).  Suddenly, the original syrupy love duet becomes a driving jazz instrumental with a pizzicato bass line that keeps an eighth-note pulse running for the full 4:20.  Very danceable.",1

I Loved It I bought this CD in Marini Music Store in Alhambra Ca.  It was a great find with original western music just like the old movies.  It brought back a lot of memories and was very well done.  I often travel from my home in the Bay Area to Southern California and the music fits so well into the traveling scenery I see on good old Interstate 5.  The music is just great.,1
"Beautiful version of a classic I found this version of ""Hushabye Mountain"" by mistake, and I'm so glad I did. I love Stacey's voice and the simple, yet unique way she sings this classic song. I hope to play it for my baby someday. It's so soothing.",1

"Bop-Velvet Very solid version of an old ""chestnut"". I listened to a hundred artists and more before picking this groups clean rendition of ""Bluesette"". All players are super: The guitarist has a delicious bell-like tone that I would like to emulate if I knew how. The sax wore ""bop-velvet"" all the way through - very tasty. (Bop-Velvet . . Might be a good new group name). .  Would like to have heard a bit more percussion in the mix, but I am not a drum expert and so will leave that to these pros. Sounds like they actually have something to say, which is not a foregone accomplishment in an often played tune. I downloaded a couple more of their songs after hearing this one.",1
One Star I purchased the song but wasn't able to download it.,0
"No Beethoven Sound I find the sound of this recording flat, unexciting & miked far away.  The sound is not very clear in some places & even boxy & muffled at times.  The tempo is on the slow side.  To my ear it shows hesitation, not depth.  I am very surprised at the praise made be some critics or the public about these performances.  Could this huge difference be the result of live recordings ??  Perhaps those people still hear the sound of actual concert they had attended !!  Here are a few comparisons.  The Heifetz recordings certainly do not justify his performances due to the thin sound.  Otherwise they are wonderful.  The Oistrakh or Pamela Frank have their own personality & worth hearing  from time to time.  But the  performances (of all the 10 sonatas) which I would very highly recommend are by Arthur Grumiaux & Clara Haskil, recorded in 1956-1957  & recently re-issued on Brilliant Classics.  They are superb with excellent attention to detail, great tempos & wonderful sound, as if they were recorded last year.  Deeply compelling & satisfying.",0

"Bandaged - A Worthy Cause, but a Crap Single This 2009 UK charity CD single benefits the BBC's Children in Need, and features artists like Peter Gabriel, Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music), Bill Wyman (The Rolling Stones), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Brian May (Queen), Midge Ure (Ultravox), Sharon Corr (The Coors), and a number of other musicians that you may or may not know of in North America (but have reasonable popularity in the UK). This Beatles cover tune was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England (with other parts,  like Peter Gabriel's bit, done elsewhere). Like most ""all-star charity singles"" the rendition of the tune is not amazing. Of course, its less about the music and more about the cause in this case, and it is certainly a worthy charity. So, while I didn't love the song, I can at least know that the proceeds of my single went to a good cause.",0

"RadioIndy Reviews: Partendo con il cuore by Andrea Andrei The wonderful CD, ""Partendo con il cuore,"" by talented artist Andrea Andrei, is bursting with delightful Pop music. This album contains musical songs that are like a blast from the past as Andrei brings back the Pop musicality of the 1990's. ""Besame (feat. Iva Hajnova),"" has a catchy beat, strong and solid vocals, and bright percussive drums. Another song, ""Malinconia (feat. Pavel Roth),"" has a nice, easy flowing beat that grooves around the smooth and emotive vocals. Andrei takes a great classic song, ""Sognando la California,"" (California Dreaming) and spins his own lovely version of it. This song moves with a vibrant beat as Andrei sings the melodic lyrics with a strong emotional intensity. If you are a fan of Pop music that is reminiscent of the `90's, then you will like the excellent Pop album, ""Partendo con il cuore."" Diane and the RadioIndy.com Reviewer Team [...]",1

"Gaga's Whitney Houston There is no question has been lately more of a cheater when it has came to her music. That showed when so many people started to compare her to Madonna when she did Born This Way. Unfortunately, I really began to feel she wasn't being making original music to call her own. For her latest song from Born This Way, Fashion Of His Love, she takes that feeling of trying to be like Whitney Houston, by sampling her classic #1 smash I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It didn't feel like it was driven from Lady Gaga, whom claimed Whitney Houston inspired her to make Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year. Sadly, it felt like Gaga really lost her mojo. I think she should try and make more original songs, than copycats feeling like they've less taste than she does. I will definitely pass up Gaga's Fashion, because it wasn't worth his or Whitney's love to deliver with.

Song: D 1/2-",0
"Lady Gaga's Whitney There is no question that Lady Gaga has shown to be more like a throwback in her music, by showing that she has been a Madonna knockoff with her music with and style. It is unfortunate that she didn't deliver it. For her latest single, Fashion Of His Love, the single from the extended version of Born This Way, takes a page from Whitney Houston's classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody in the tone. Gaga claimed that Whitney Houston inspired her song Born This Way at the Grammys earlier this year, but yet when anyone tries to sample a great song, it feels more like it is the pits sampled, especially when anyone tries to do a Whitney song. I think Gaga needs to find more original music to call her own, not take on someone who showed she wanted to dance with somebody.

"Not the Greatest Naxos Achievement These days in classical music are all about restless search for new material to be recorded for whichever label wants to get their hands dirty. Naxos - inexpensive, mediocre, usually poorly recorded label has been a leader in that field. Musicians will do pretty much anything to be called "" an recording artist"" which validates them in the field.

There are reasons why some compositions meant to remain in disparity. Playel's output is no exception. Relentless, soulless patterns repeated over and over again, with no particular emotional meaning leave you screaming of boredom and frustration. I must give the credit to  Mr. Gallois for trying to infuse this absolutely terrible music with some soul, and bearable moments.  Thank you for trying. By no means these recordings will bring anything new to neither educational nor scholar fields. The only thing they might achieve is to steer people away.",0

"Sousa Marches On The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Instead we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.

That said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.

The great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa's marches along with his other music is that you get a complete band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perhaps one of America's greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.

There are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have ""From Maine to Oregon""  and the ever popular ""US Field Artillery March""  featuring the famous ""Caisson Song""  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I guess we forgot about that some where along the way.

Anyway, I digress here.  The overture ""Dwellers of the Western World""  is one of Sousa's larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa's time.  We should not pass judgement on it.

This is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perhaps lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.",1

"Dynamic Range issues My five year old goes to bed every night listening to music from an Android Tablet using Amazon's mp3 player.

This album is not a good choice because some of the songs are much quieter than the others...from experience I can tell you this results in the child coming downstairs and saying he cant hear his music or the player isn't working.  But, if you turn it up so he can hear the quiet songs, the loud ones (like the first one on this compilation) are too loud.

Compare the first and second songs...way too much difference.",0
the Blues He's got the grungy cigar smokin blues voice. The choice of words in the his lyric's are spot on not for the wimpy faint of heart. Great guitar and beat with a few other instruments makes this cd a great blues buy. I'm still listening and enjoying it more.,1

"Warning songs have been CHANGED Original music is nothing like this bland ""remaster"" All the re-issues and recompilations of the original Penguin Cafe Orchestra have been altered, or rather bastardized, by Arthur Jeffres, son of the originl composer Simon Jeffre.  Simon's songs were unique and seemed to come out of a completely unknown place when they emerged in the 1970s. Horridly, after Simon died young from a brain tumor, his son took over the copyright, which meant that the entire orchestra could no longer play under the original name. They called themselves the Anteater's for a while - before the Internet there was no way to save the band. Then they grew old and most gave up music. The orginal CD's from forty years ago are a revelation. The phenomenal but understated dynamics of the original are altered and lost now that the son and his band have recorded weak, bland rewrites of Simon Jeffres compositions under the same song titles - selling commercially and to a supposedly brass-eared younger crowd. Some of us have the original CD's and LPs. Nothing like this bland, somnolent, idiocy. What a foolish turn of events. I urge you to quest after the original recordings and compositions.",0

I first heard this as the soundtrack to an MMD music video on Youtube.  Fell in love with the song right away.  Makes good use of Miku's ""voice"" from the Vocaloid software.  While the beat is not exactly the most ""dance-able"", it does sound addictive.  I put this on my MP3 player and love to put this song on repeat while lounging outside in the shade on a sunny & breezy late afternoon.  Good music to relax and kill stress with.

"Good upbeat pop sound. There are no doubt better pop songs done by Luka, but this one isn't too bad.  I'm not the best at categorizing different styles of pop, but the best way I can describe it is that its style and tone is most closely like that of ""High End City"" by Rin Kagamine (google it or look it up on Youtube).

"Memorable for all the wrong reasons I don't fully understand the market for old vinyl. I buy certain records because I want a particular performance that is not available on any other medium - I then transcribe it to digital and the disk goes back in the cupboard. I also believe that some people see the vinyl object itself as a collectable (like an old book or pocket watch)  because of its historical significance even though a better remastered version of the same performance may be available in some other form.

So why would anyone want to buy this? It is true that this recording has never been remastered or reissued so if you want to listen to what Schulze and the Telemann Society make of this work, then this is the only way you can. It is also true that in 1962 when this was issued, this may have been the first and - for some time - the only recording of the Dettingen in the catalogue.

However, to offset these two reasons for buying there is one overwhelming reason why you shouldn't. This is without doubt the worst performance of the work I have ever heard. Instruments are laughably out of tune, the chorus sounds like ther local bowling club trying it for the first time, none of the soloists are up to par with the alto sounding like a toothache-suffering sheep. Recording quality is not terrible but is poorly balanced with undue prominence given to the wind instruments.

This, of course could all be a good reason to buy the disk. It certainly is a memorable performance albeit for all the wrong reasons.",0

The extended solo in the middle featuring  a mix of Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" solo is pretty inventive and actually fits nicely.  So, in that sense, the song itself is well worth the download.  But, and this is a BIG but, the downloaded song is only 128kbps.  That's unforgivable!  When paying to download a song, you expect it be 320kbps, or at the very least 256kbps.  When money is involved, the consumer should be given the best quality format available.  But to give it to you at 128kbps is inexcusable.  This is exactly why piracy exists.

"The Rick Danko and Richard Manuel we hoped to hear more of after the Band. Rick Danko was fabulous as a member of the Band.  His bass playing was solid and vocals on songs like ""It Makes No Difference"" and ""Across the Great Divide"" were terrific.  However, on most of his post-Band releases, there is a lack of energy that combined with his melancholy vocals just seem too dreary.  However, on this release from the soundboard at the Lone Star in Manhattan, Danko and his ""Band""-mate Richard Manuel combine with Paul Butterfield to produce a lively, joyous extended set that is a tribute to both former Band members who died far too soon.  Obviously, Richard must have suffered mightily to take his own life and in his last years, Rick Danko, looked weighed down with pathos.  So it is bittersweet to have a recording such as this to remind lovers of Americana-type music that these two were gifted and vital.  Thanks to whoever arranged for the release of this album.  We miss Rick D. and are glad to have these additional performances to warm our home.",1

"advice for Shania... Shania Twain has never seemed like a person who hangs out with other musicians, and this is a shame. It explains why she would make a bee-line for David Foster the second she was ready to make a ""come back."" If she were my friend, I would beg her to steer clear of the David Foster machine which seems to have the unfortunate tendency to flatten out every artist under a sickly-sweet blanket of strings and uninspired piano arrangements. Anything that guy touches has ""cheese"" written all over it: predictable, soft-rock friendly, and catering to the same people who run out to buy the latest Josh Grobin record.

She should reach out to real musicians who write their own music and understand their craft. I would love to see her make a pared-down record that is clean and from the heart, as opposed to something that sounds as if it was churned out of a music vending machine. I know she has worked with Allison Krauss - I wonder how she would have approached this song. The way it sounds right now is pretty awful, in my opinion - it sounds as though it was recorded in an hour.

It will be a real shame if Shania Twain throws her talent away and leaves her songs in the hands of producers who will ruin her music and engineer her songs to fit a predictable radio format. It will only serve to reinforce the suspicion that she cannot make a record without being under the control of a powerful, male producer who ultimately makes all of the musical decisions for her.",0

"Pure torture to listen to I wish I could give these CDs no stars because they are God awful. I never listened to them as a kid I don't think, but I work with someone else's child (he has special needs) and these are all his mom wants him to listen to, even though he's technically an adult. Ughh it's so annoying. I don't even think he likes them! The CDs have multiple tracks that are the same. No variety! And the kids can't sing. Like, at all. It makes my brain feel like it's going to explode. And I have to deal with this trash for a 6 hours which is how long my shift is. I'm quitting because I can't take listening to the crap anymore (haha that was a little joke but seriously it's annoying). I don't have kids yet, but when I do we are not going to listen to this. Don't buy unless you like highly irritating songs being played over & over.",0
"Tone deaf children and a creepy old guy will serenade your children .... Well, they ""updated"" the original version of WeeSing that I loved as a child. If you know the original, you're probably with me on the following commentary. If you are new to Wee Sing you shouldn't comment because you have no sound basis of comparison.

On this new version you can look forward to:

1. Children singing in every song. EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. And not talented children. No.  These are children obviously plucked from some random mall talent show or failed Disney audition. Half of the little cherubs sound as if they're a special combination of underwater and congested while the other half are just completely tone deaf.

2. A creepy old man. But not just any creepy old man - this creepy old man sings a stunning version of ""What Did Delaware?"" that will become the voice that narrates your nightmares. Let your kid listen to it. I hear kids LOVE creepy

3. New verses to old favorites. You know, because a song that has been around forever probably needed a dumb new verse no one knows.

4. Every single other CD in the WeeSing series has been plagued by these same problems.

If someone knows where to get the old tapes (preferably NOT in tape form), I'd love to buy them.",0

claire's album is a bit of a chore to listen to mostly because:
1 it isn't nearly as quirky or delicious as Marina and the Diamonds and so the songs are not strong enough to grab you
2 it is unintentionally bombastic (versus intentionally bombastic but done very exquisitely like Florence and the Machine) and just gets tiring to listen to (even on the first spin)
3 her vocals, while generally ok, pale in comparison, of say, Sharleen Spiteri of Texas and just seem a bit forced

This is one of those bands that represents what rock music might be today if the hair bands never came along. there are not many true southern rock bands around today. there are pretenders, like Kid Rock. Dixie Hustler are the real deal. They will make you believers in Southern Rock again in the Mold of bands Like Lynyrd Skynyrd , Molly Hatchet, and more recently, The Regulators.

"Pure Pleasure, Now and Always Rockpile was a rarity: a supergroup that didn't sound or act like one. It was the perfect 1980 band, combining love for and experience in the music of the past three decades ('50s, '60s, '70s) into its own perfect album and tours. Rockpile came into existence when one of the all-time great songwriters, Nick Lowe, joined a great guitarist with a notable history, Dave Edmunds, a great drummer, Terry Williams (soon-to-be of Dire Straits), and a fine guitarist in his own right, Billy Bremner. They got together to have fun, and they split up when the fun was over. Perfect.

'Live at Montreux 1980' is their perfect live album. Tight, hot, wham-bam-ohCharlieonemoretime!-thank-you-ma'am, unbelievably lively. Reports are they got dropped from a tour with stablemate Bad Company because the guys made Paul Rodgers & Co. irrelevant; they left the stage with the audience in their pocket. I'm listening to 'Montreux' as I write this review, and there's no doubt why.

Malcolm Dome wrote the liner notes to 'Montreux' with a similar sentiment to mine. A metalhead ('Kerrang!') liking rockabilly? Huh? Listen to this CD, and you'll hopefully see why.

Rockabilly isn't my favorite kind of music, either, but 'Live at Montreux 1980' should be on every rock fan's list of to-do's. Your honey might even thank you for it.",1

"Soft and Slow As far as video game soundtracks are concerned, L.A. Noire's is one of the best.  The Main Theme from this set is particularly good in how it sets the perfect mood with a soft, jazzy tone composed largely of trumpet, piano, and brush-drums.  The melody is slow and deliberate, just like the pacing of the game, and things pick up slightly later on when the piano does a bit of solo work on its own.

It may not be the most sophisticated song out there, but it's not supposed to be.  If you want something energetic or complicated, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for pure atmosphere with a bit of mystery, or just want to mellow out to a relaxing song, then you can't do much better than this one.

Sahffi Lynne is a professional musician, performing artist, international singer/songwriter, vocalist, private teacher, coach and teaching artist. She spreads her message of Light & Love throughout the world through her heart-grabbing performances, songwriting, teachings and musicianship.

Her album ""Expectations"" shows Sahffi's versatile musicianship and vocals.  One of my favorite tracks on the album is ""Ticktock Islands"" where Ms. Lynne's atmospheric whisperings lead to rising ethereal voices, and then back to the peaceful soft tones of her voice.  It is performed very well and showcases the creativity and skill of this talented artist.",1
"Original artist mixes are better I thought it was a mix of the original songs, but realized these songs are sung by no-name session singers.  It still works for some songs, but did NOT work for others, like Michael Jackson.

A great listen anytime you want to be immersed in prodigious playing/engineering of jazz/rock/funk/fusion instrumental music.",1

This is NOT for the casual listener.. The music is quite sophisticated and requires the listener to THINK.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who is fond of stirring, complex harmonies.. I've never seen the movie, but if it ever comes my way, I will set aside time from my busy schedule..",1

I already own the movie and have enjoyed it for many years, the music is one of the great highlights of the film and I am so pleased to now own a copy of this Soundtrack for myself.  There are some great African ""spiritual"" type songs on here, with my personal favorite being the Southland Concerto.

Recommended, and the price is very reasonable for the high production values for the music!

It has a laid back/calming vibe and I've used it as a cool down song after a spinning class.  Kind of makes me feel, ""Aaaaaaaaah.""  It reminded me of Radiohead's Talk Show Host.  It has that same vibe.  Great song to chill out to and one to add to your playlist.",1

"Eclectic and Melodic ""Clutching Stems"" by Ladybug Transistor is a fun romp into pop splendor at 3:21 minutes.  The song is a simple tune that will brighten any one's mood with its simple melody with somewhat ambiguous and poetic lyrics.  The band has been around for some time but their sound is as fresh as ever with this song that resonates with the past as well as with the present.  There is a bit of The The and Belle and Sebastian within the vocals and a synthesis of beat and rhythm of Owl City.  But regardless of one's musical interests, ""Clutching Stems"" is worthy of more than one listen.",1
"Clutching stems - grasping at straws This band lost their drummer shortly before the recording of this song and unfortunately it shows.  This song actually has potential, but replacing a live drummer with a simplistic and droning drum machine beat leaves it a little stale. Too bad, unless the song was written so that you would actually miss their drummer .. in which case they succeed ... but the song suffers as a result and the lilting background violins can not compensate.",0

"A 16 Minute Score That Never Flourishes Every Day is a family drama starring Liev Schreiber and Helen Hunt. The film revolves around a family in day to day life and pretty much explores life and everything that comes with it. For the score Jeanine Tesori composes a wonderful small score that has all the right beats but misses being a grand arcing piece. Now you may say that the film is about hitting small moments and such, but any film with a score release that is only 16 minutes clearly isn't letting the score do its job.

What we have here are simple little melodies that while good don't do much in terms of crafting emotional depth. The central motif is quite beautiful and provides a wonderful anchoring point. The score is mostly piano, guitar and strings so the melodies are very strong and hit precisely. What the score does well is craft a warm feeling and then pulls it away so you get a sense of longing. Unfortunately due to the short track times and overall short running time the music doesn't have much of an effect. I absolutely love the last track and it's a great finishing point but it wasn't until that last track that I became completely immersed with the emotions that the music was communicating.

The end result feels like a wonderful vision that wasn't allowed to spread its wings. When films don't let the score flow the way a score should the result is a choppy obstructed emotional arc. It's essentially cutting off the blood flow of the film.",0

I came across this in a search of Carrie Underwood and purchased it for $1.29...way more than I typically spend.

I have downloaded recordings from these albums that have the dark gray background with the apparent tree branches in the lower right side, much to my financial loss.  I thought the sound on sampling was only because of listening through the computer, but after downloading others that sound exactly like this sample, you can't believe how bad the sound is.  I got a used Nonesuch LP of this recording and transferred to CDR - much better, even with some LP surface noise.  I now avoid these dark gray albums with the tree in the lower right foreground like the plague.",0
"Charming performance, atrocious sound I thought the poor quality of the preview was simply due to heavier compression for samples.  Nope.  The treble and bass are desperately weak, lending the the music a terrible flat dullness.  I thought I heard a compression artifact in the first movement, even though the file reports as a 194 kbps VBR MP3 encoded with LAME 3.97.

Either this is a very old performance remastered (poorly) from tape, or a recent performance with depressingly poor sound engineering.  Or perhaps it was overcompressed at some point and then upsampled to 194 kbps before being made available, though that would make no sense at all.

A pity as I am quite content with the musicality.  Maybe I can play it in the car.",0
"mmmmmmm Listening to this single takes me back to the day I got the 3-song promo cassette of Draconian Times.  What a return to form!  I haven't heard THIS Paradise Lost since that time.  It has the desperate, sad feel to the songs, yet rocks, yet is melodic.  It has a more raw sound that PL hasn't really had since Draconian Times or actually even more like Icon (my personal favorite album by PL).  Excellent work by one of metaldom's most overlooked bands.  I can't wait to hear the rest of this album!",1

"Ruined already perfect song! This song was already amazing! There was no need to ruin it with this womans horrible vocals. Benjamin Burnley's vocals are amazing on their own. The record company seriously screwed him over by letting this single happen. I believe in Ben's abilty to carry a song without the aid of background vocals and I believe that Ben would have never agreed to this ""remix"" by this group Valora. Has anyone seen them or even heard any of their work. The lead singer looks like a pornstar turned wannabe singer. So just don't waste your money on this single,stick to the original it is 100x better!",0
"Why this song is awful; or, ""How to re-release a good song and make it bad"" I don't know why Breaking Benjamin allowed a perfectly good song to be ruined, but a part of me likes to think that this was done without their knowledge. The piercing cat-in-heat vocals of the female adds nothing to this track... instead, it makes it sound like an abomination, the result of overzealous music producers trying to cash in on the ""hard alt-rock with female lead singers"" genre that has lead to such plagues like Skillet and Evanescence. They are the Creeds and Nickelbacks of the rock genre, bland bands that sound alike with no real distinction other than how much mascara the males in the band wear.

Back to the song. The song was good when released. Made for a soundtrack, and served its purpose well. With the addition of a banshee yelling in the background off-key with no mixing other than volume levels, the song has the same quality one would expect from a child singing into a microphone to his/her favorite Dora the Explorer song (but at least, it may be considered ""cute"" in that case). In this case, someone spent money to fly the poor, talentless child to a recording studio, sit her down and say, ""hey, here's a song that was popular among a niche group for a few months, give it a go and see if we can't spice things up!"", and then pay to have it released nationwide. It makes as much sense as spending money to have Rebecca Black make songs.

Can one blame the female singer for doing this? Not really. As bad of a singer as she may be, if someone was offered money to sing something, they would take it, even knowing that they may sound like Oscar the Grouch on crystal meth and Red Bull. Perhaps, due to circumstances, one can blame Breaking Benjamin, assuming they hold all the rights to the song. However, blame can be applied to the ""composer"", ""mixer"", and distributor. Note that the first two are in quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm, as the distributor is the only one out of the three that knew how to do their job correctly, whilst the others had the ambition to their jobs right like Bonnie Grape had to lose weight (that is a reference to the book ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", for those of you who don't know, or rather, the movie, for those who were born in the generation that promotes music like the one this review is about).

Digressing back to the point of the review, if there is any slim chance that the Stop Online Piracy Act can somehow stop abortions like this from ever occurring ever again, then not only do I support it, I will bludgeon those who oppose it, feed them to iguanas, then take the fecal matter that is produced by those iguanas, load them into a rocket, and fire that rocket into the sun.",0
"Why? Why ruin a good song by allowing a subpar vocalist be ""featured""? Her voice just doesn't go along with the music. Don't waste your money on this version - go pick up the original. One of the tracks on this album:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-2-Vol-1/dp/B00067RF6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 2, Vol. 1</a>",0
"""Black"" Metal done right :) This a ""band"" that is actually one guy who plays all the instruments, Maksim Ryanskiy. To me, this would compare to older Emperor as far as the vocals and the guitar tone. Songs are well written and structured -the production gives this release a ""thinner"" sound due to well, that's what black metal fans usually like! Black metal and death metal are polar opposites in the musical spectrum of metal in that true BM has a thinner, lo-fi sound while (good) death metal has a beefy, heavy and thicker production.  This some good stuff, I very much recommend this album.",1
"Wu-Tang Leaps Across the Pond Originally posted on my blog, Hip Hop Is Read (Nov. 8, 2009):

The fate of the Shaolin Temple was sealed by its leaders' refusal to open its doors to newcomers seeking to join their following. Had it not been for the monks' initial anti-proselytization policy; had they accepted all those who sought entrance, the Temple may never have been destroyed. This important lesson, often recounted by The RZA, is a perfect analogy for the Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture series. Released in 2005, volume one introduced a lineup of indie/underground emcees whose form and style were so compatible with Wu-Tang that it made for one of the year's most thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) albums. In 2009, a new chamber of cross-breeding music has been opened, this time introducing a whole new genre/style to the Wu-Tang sound: Enter the Dubstep.

Dubstep originated earlier within the decade in the midst of the UK garage scene. A fusion of house, drum and bass, 2-step, and London's grime, with influence from dub reggae, dubstep is characterized by its dark, uptempo beats. While artists like Lady Sovereign and Dizzee Rascal have expounded definitely-British sounds to the United States' audience, the movement hasn't really caught on across the pond... or has it? This year alone, dubstep has made a significant leap into the consciousness of U.S. music fans, whether they knew it or not. Dubstep producers Chase and Status' smash track ""Eastern Jam"" was adopted and remixed by none other than Snoop Dogg on his promotional single ""Snoop Dogg Millionaire"". Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep seeks to further familiarize this new audience.

While volume one of the Indie Culture series brought along a roster of emcees, volume two is production-centric, highlighting the work of over a dozen dubstep producers. To the newfound dubstep listener - I'll admit, I'm one of them - Indie Culture Volume 2's mixes are either hit or miss; thankfully, they're mostly hit. Tracks like Chimpo's remix of the haunting ""Cinema"" by the GZA and his son are eerily intensified by the sinister keys and the dark and sparse soundscapes played throughout. In such instances, the production creates a brand new setting, providing the vocals an alternative meaning to the original; in others, they re-sample original beats, putting an emphasis on dub remixing rather than remaking. The Scuba Scythe remix to ""Street Corners"", for example, retools the great Jean Plum sample from the original, crafting a bubbling, new interpretation that's equally pleasing to the ears.

Unlike the first entry in the Indie Culture series, Enter the Dubstep does not feature any new vocals. The album is a hodgepodge of verses and choruses from previously-released Wu-Tang and Wu-Tang affiliate albums like Raekwon and Icewater's Polluted Water, Lord Jamar's The 5% Album, Wisemen's Wisemen Approaching, GZA's Pro Tools, U-God's Dopium and more (including volume one of the series). While it would have been nice to hear some new lyrics - especially by the main members of the Clan - it works out better this way since this collection is intended to primarily highlight the producers; as such, it's gainful to compare and contrast the originals to the remixes.

It's worth noting that being a fan of Wu-Tang is not an assurance that you'll enjoy this album. Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep is very much like Linkin Park's Reanimation in this regard. Open-mindedness is a pre-requisite, particularly for the untrained ear of the genre being tackled. Nineteen tracks deep, unless you're a dubstep fan you may find yourself pressing the fast-forward button once every few or so tracks. But like Reanimation, the core content is still intact despite the altered sounds and backdrops. Overall you'll find that there's plenty of common ground to be shared and enjoyed when you Enter the Dubstep.",1

Heards writing in Christian Philosophy leaned toward the darker side, never losing grasp of the hope contained in that Truth.

Pressing on the 'flexible' neck caused it to be even louder, and then it started stuttering and could not always reach full power.

Very disappointed since this is the most expensive toy I've purchased so far and I had high hopes. Will probably try the hitachi next.",0
"Sorely Dissapointed I bought this for my wife because her 3 year old hitachi wand's age was showing. I threw that wand away (even though it was still in great working condition even after so much use) and decided to buy this one. At first it worked fine, she said the speed was comparable to the hitachi, but the neck was so flimsy when she added any pressure the thing would make a terrible loud noise so she avoided doing that. One thing to add though, the wand was just as loud as the hitachi at full speed, so we were a bit both disappointed about that. She used the wand about once a week since we bought it, and for about 10 minute sessions, sometimes less. After the 3rd use the wand start making a horrible burning smell. Some things really can ruin a mood when all you smell is burning metal and plastic. By the 4th and 5th use the fumes were just unbearable, and you could hear the motor inside speeding up and slowing down, speeding up and slowing down. It was like an old broken motor boat. I didn't understand how this month old wand could break so quickly since she hardly used it and we were for the most part gentle with it. Fortunately after my problems with this faulty product, I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money, so I feel bad giving this just 1 star, but after all reviews should be based on the product not customer service, at least not from a non-involved party in this case since it's sold by a 3rd party company and not Amazon. At this point I wish we would have kept the old wand, but with the refund money we're going back to ol' faithful and buying hitachi again!",0
poorly made I bought my body Wand and got it today. I have had a Hitachi magic wand and loved that and just got rid of my Adam and eve massager and was looking for something that was less noisy and more powerful. This product is less powerful and noisy. Don't get it if your looking for jaw dropping pleasure like form the Hitachi or adam and eve. The thing sounds like it is about to die when you put any sort of pressure on the head part. Never again will I by this product.,0
Body Wand Review Body Wand is lighter than Hitachi.  Body Wand is louder than advertised.  The massage head is large.  Not what I was looking for at all.,0

"BEWARE, all CBS Mastersound Half-Speed Mastered LPs are16 bit/ 44.1kHz digitally remastered recordings Yes, it's true, ALL CBS Mastersound Half-Speed Mastered LPs are low-resolution16 bit/ 44.1kHz digitally remastered recordings as detailed in-depth on the insert that comes with the LPs. So you may as well buy a true analog original pressing if you want true analog sound. Or if you want digital music, save your money and buy the CD instead, it's going to be the same... but with no surface noise.",0

"Hidden Gem of UK Electro-Pop! While not as ornately textured as their very best contemporaries, The Ultrasonics' formula of simple electropop melody and catchy beats make for consistent entertainment throughout this debut LP.

"Not the sound that the rest of the album has. So you can get this song for free.  Big Deal!

This song does not have the style of music that Thievery Corporation in know for.  The 'rapping' is not that good, but I'll give you that the lyrics try to be relevant.

The laid back vibe is totally missing on this song and does not represent the rest of the album, which is quite good.  Go and listen to some of the other music from this.  Why did they release this??

Heaven Is Going To Burn Your Eyes Out or Holographic Universe are songs that truly represent the sound of this amazing duo.  Go find the earlier albums rather then get this free song.

I just hope that this is not the beggining of the end for them.",0

"Album of the year? This may be one of a handful of reviews I've ever written on here, but I just had to. I'm listening to the album now, and it's very clear, that this is a special band. Still listening, but already shades of LCD Soundsystem, The Cure & David Bowie are coming to mind. Great production and instruments/sounds in each track. Definitely a rarity in this day to hear albums like this. I'm continuing to be amazed as I type.",1

One Star worst decision of my life when I was young,0
"Dreadful If you think artists like Ke$ha or Britney are bad, then prepare yourself for a whole new level of awful. The music is too simple and sounds like it could have been created by a 10 year old with a casio keyboard. The lyrics are trashier than Ke$ha and Rihanna (and that's saying something) and just as direct and simple as the music. I love how reviewers on here genuinely think this is good and treat it like it's a masterpiece or has some musical credibility - let's be honest, it doesn't.",0
SO SO incredibly awful I would rate this no stars. My sister has all of this monstrosity of a band's albums and their lead singer dahvi is about as pleasant to listen to as a choir of Vuvuzelas looped for a few minutes. That and they have the worst lyricism i have EVER heard combines to make a serious atrocity. This band will NEVER be anything more than a niche band with a niche fanbase.  BTW the lead singer should rename himself Vuvezela.,0
Five Stars Great product. Arrived a few weeks ago now and in perfect condition. Thank you,1
Cute! I love this song.  I saw the music video and fell in love. It was not at all what I expected as it sounds like an emo boy band.... But as a child of the 90's I have a strange love for teeny bopper pop sounding songs.,1
"Can't download the song! I bought this song on December 1st and I was unable to download it. Even though this is my first time purchasing this song it says I already downloaded it. I can stream it, but I can't listen to streaming music since my internet connection isn't stable enough. That's why I bought it to download so I can listen to it offline! There doesn't seem to be a way to download a song after Amazon Music THINKS  you've already downloaded it. I had to go buy it again on iTunes so I could actually download it and I'm happy with my iTunes purchase. This is a great song that I really enjoy because it's such a happy and upbeat song. I just wish this purchase would have gone more smoothly. I didn't have this problem with any of the other songs I purchased through Amazon, but now that I know this issue can happen I'm going to be more careful in the future.",0

"GREAT GREAT SONG. WOW... This song is SOOoooo good!  Make sure to check out the video of this song wtih Josh Garrels.  His vocals are so INCREDIBLE and beautiful.  The lyrics are beautiful, and the music has a little bit of an island feel... beautiful, happy, everything you need to feel joyful and beautiful.
This is one of those songs you might not want to stop listening to... it's beautiful and catchy and just takes you away and away.  It's spiritual and
catchy and beautiful all at the same time.  Thank you, Josh Garrels for this lovely music.",1

"Amazon, what were you thinking? I've said before that I don't understand the point in giving away a remix as the Free MP3 of the Day.  I don't know Amon Tobin's ""Surge"" in the first place, so why would I want to hear it remixed?  Such were my thoughts as I waited for this track to download.

Then I actually listened to it, and all rational thought ceased - and I came to a new understanding.  No, I didn't figure out why Amazon would choose to call special attention to a remix of a song most of us have never heard.  What I figured out was why this is called the ""Two Fingers Remix.""  I believe it's because this is what you would hear in your head if you stuck two fingers into an electrical socket.  Indeed, the sound of this piece can best be described as ""the experience of electrocution in slow motion,"" though ""cats mating in a video arcade, c. 1990"" comes close.

Dear readers, I have had days when I was feeling stressed out and not really in the mood to write a review.  I have had days when my sensitive soul was so battered by unfriendly feedback as to tempt me to retreat quietly into a corner to lick my wounds.  But never in all the time I have been reviewing the Free MP3 of the Day have I come this close to skipping a day altogether - because this song had barely started before I found myself painfully eager to turn it off, and I can't in good conscience write a review of a song I haven't listened to all the way through.  I sucked it up and toughed it out - several times in fact - just because I could never live with myself if I didn't warn you what you were getting into if you clicked that oh-so-innocuous ""Download"" button.

Hit that button at your own risk.  And don't ever say I never did anything for you.",0

"Any instruments??? I've listened and I have to agree with the 1-star reviewer.

I too became a music lover in the late '60s and the '70s.

"Not the best BLUETECH - and borders on Pretentious Never thought I'd give a BLUETECH recording a negative review, but this one qualifies. It is pretentious, ponderous, and not as enjoyable as the previous CD's In My Opinion. The female singers are both annoying. Ms. Blackstone tries WAY too hard, forcing those hellacious high notes, and cracking the glass within My head. .The Poetic Female ""Singer"" on two songs is over-elucidating silly lyrics that are snarky in their uselessness. Like a stoned Hippie grabbing for meaningful words, it is painful to listen to. Hope BLUETECH gets back on track. He creates some of the most scintillating Music out there. For Me, not on this CD though.",0

"Really Wonderful What a great CD!
I bought it for a family member and I listen to it often.  Personally, I do not recognize the hymns b/c there are no lyrics; the instrumentals are fantastic.  I would have never come across this CD if I hadn't purchased it for someone else b/c I have never purchased religious genre music.
There is such an eclectic selection of worldly instrumentals.  Some songs have become daily favorites, especially for de-stressing, meditating, yoga, or falling asleep.
Also, many of these instrumentals are such a treasure to listen to because in some of these countries Christianity is banned and we would never naturally be able to listen to these songs otherwise.
We just LOVE THIS CD!",1
"Matt Mason is such a great new talent If you have never heard Matt Mason, PLEASE listen to this song.
Matt won CMT's Next Superstar competition in 2011 and his career is taking off.

"My favorite jazz incompetently presented Oscar Peterson is by head and shoulders my favorite classic jazz artist. I have a number of his albums on both CD and MP3, and all the others I've listened to sound great. I don't know how you achieve making Oscar Peterson sound bad, but whoever put this album together managed it.

The high notes are tinny. The bass is distorted and fuzzy. There are cracks and pops as if the source material was damaged vinyl. The price for 85 Peterson tunes sounds too good to be true, and the result fits that cliche. If you don't believe me, just listen to the track samples. The problems are evident in virtually every one of them.

If you like jazz, by all means listen to Oscar Peterson, but please, please, don't let this be your first experience. Oscar Peterson and his Trio are top flight talent. This album, which presents with all the acoustic quality of your average elementary school cafeteria, would sadly put you off from discovering his incredible talent on properly produced media.",0
"Inessential Crap This is not essential to anyone, unless you are looking for 85 of the most poorly recorded monaural tracks in Oscar Peterson's career. The sound quality is atrocious, and every track that I've listened to so far (it's too painful to listen to more than 3 or 4 tracks at a time) are in mono. The louder dynamics from the piano break up. DO NOT BUY THIS.",0

almost irritating TThe music is great  by itself but they decided to add in all these sound effects --- ohing - ahhing - of people in the throes of passion.

Relaxing Soothing and relaxing variety of music coupled with the ocean.  Very nice if you like the sound of the ocean.,1
"THE BEST--ORDER THIS ONE! The given: effective relaxation music tends to be in the ear of the listener. Ordering on Kindle is hit and miss since one has only 30 seconds to listen before the cutoff to buy or pass. Over the years I've spent considerable money on CDs that gave no warning a cacophonous piano riff or other loud sound would erupt and pull me out of drowsy to full on awake. THE SECRET GARDEN is perfect! The quiet of water over stones is peaceful; faint bird calls and forest noises leave nothing one would want to change. I even love the name! :) Buy this one.

It's just one guy playing one insturment on every track and some tracks are near identical, like a Wal-Mart Tai Chi album. No way; sample the tracks first and you'll see.

"Yoga Music BORING!  I guess if you wanted to fall asleep this would be a great album.  Also, since I'm a teacher as well as a practitioner, it would be very nice if someone would put music in order...in other words: a slow centering song first, followed by music that goes with your practice and builds in intensity (as this album says ""Power Yoga""...ha), then lowering the intensity until you add the last song for savasana (a very meditative type of song).

VERY DISAPPOINTED!",0

"Lush, Bright, and Exceptional I first heard this LP in the early 1970's and was delighted to find it on compact disc on Amazon.  I was surprised that many of these recordings were from the mid to late 40's and yet the quality of the recordings are crystal clear.  These songs are arranged and scored in such a majestic manner with a large orchestra which does more than provide background music for each arrangement itself sounds like a suite, as it each track was by itself a production number.  All of the great composers of the 20th century, or at least many of them, are featured here and as someone who listens to a great deal of music, I enjoy this album very much and highly recommend it.",1

He says nhale on the count of five and exhale on the count of five which I think is too much deep breathing. Most relaxation tapes are inhale on three and exhale on three. By the way,  he doesn't say this but Inhale deeply and exhale very slowly and let it go, like a whisper......or you will probably cough and not relax. I saw him on Dr. Phil and thougth he was this great expert.......Not on relaxation breathing, he isn't......in my opinion. To each his own.",0

"Soothing and authentic I like this selection for evening relaxation while getting ready for bed. The soundtrack is very close to actual nature sounds. I recommend this because of the authenticity of what a natural stream would sound like with just the right amount of accompaniment of sounds at a volume that sounds real, the sound of the bird is soft, more quiet as if it were in the distance. I have sampled and purchased other similar soundtracks that are trying to hard to mimic nature with over use of nature sounds and random placement that is not relaxing at all. Many a night I have drifted into wonderful sleep, this definitely helps me quiet my mind and relax.",1

"Overpriced & not worth it As a huge collector of U.S. cd singles I was very excited to see a release of GaGa's Judas, that is until I read the fine print ""This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media"". So not only is this inferior to an actual record label release, it is also priced 4 to 6 dollars more. WHY? Contrary to what another reviewer stated, the U.S. cd single is far from dead. Last year it had it's first increase in total sales in more than 15 years & that trend is continuing in 2011. Anybody who keeps close tabs on the Billboard charts would know that. There are more titles available as cd singles on the HOT 100 than there has been in years. The difference now is that many are exclusives. Last year WalMart led the way with 17 exclusives & some of their stores even started promoting cd singles. Other stores like Justice, Target, Hot Topic & Borders & independent record stores have had exclusives & even some artist websites like Taylor Swift are selling them. Some of the bigger titles released were California Girls by Katy Perry, F**k you by Cee Lo Green, Nothin' On You by B.o.

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Phlying Saucer - Pancakes (Independent)
The Californian four-piece, Phlying Saucer, return to the fray with a second 5-track EP of super-melodic pop-punk. Bassist / vocalist / knob twiddler, Evan Brass, has certainly earned his bonus with a razor sharp production which effortlessly leaps out of the speakers, grabbing the listener by the collar, and demanding full, unwavering attention.

EPs work brilliantly for new bands without a full album of songs to release, but equally there's absolutely no room for filler, and it's to the band's credit they understand completely the stipulations of the format. All five songs deliver maximum hooks and thrills, and it's obvious from the moment opening track ""Breaking Down Takes Two"" hits its chorus, we're in the hands of a band making the most of their opportunity.

If you've yet to discover them, now's the time - before they go mega.",1
"Stephen Foster and Al Jolson - A match made in Heaven This is truly a great selection of songs. I know I'm treading on thin ice here, doubly so because of both the singer and the songs sung on this set of mp3 selections.

I only became aware of Al Jolson back in the late 1970's or early 1980's after seeing ""The Jolson Story"", and it wasn't really the star that impressed me so much as it was his voice and singing style along with the songs sung. People argue that he was one of those who sang in minstrel shows and in black-face which only served to further stereotype and denigrate African-Americans of the times, and to enjoy his music now only further serves to do the same. I can't speak to that. I wasn't there, but I know those were different times, and Jolson was playing to different audiences with different mindsets. My Parents listened to Foster's songs, which was how I grew to enjoy them, but hearing Jolson sing them was truly an enjoyable event. There was never a desire to see Jolson all dressed up in black-face, however. I don't admire the man that much!

As for this selection of mp3 downloads, I am not Jewish, so I can't speak to the few selections chosen that represent his religious upbringing, but, as I said, I have always enjoyed Stephen Collins Foster's songs, ever since I was a child in the late 1950's, when it was still politically correct to listen to them. And to combine the voice of Al Jolson with the tunes of Stephen Foster, even in these times when it may not be politically correct to listen or play such songs, I say is like a match made in heaven.

For those of you who like and admire this singer, these songs would make a great addition to your collection as they are much different that the usual show tunes you hear him sing, and only add to the bulk of his repertoire already existent.",1
"Mistitled - poor disc to mp3 transfer The correct title of this recording is That Glory Day. It is the same song recorded by Una Mae Carlisle in 1944. Unfortunately, this hard-to-find version by Wingy on the Hallmark label is slightly better than transistor-radio quality. It is either a badly-done disc to mp3 transfer or a transfer from a really worn 78. This version for historical interest only.

There is a much more listenable version of the same recording available through another music service but it would have required downloading an unwanted storefront and player software just to purchase the track. Hopefully Amazon, in the future, will be able to offer a much better version of the recording than this one without purchasers having to jump through hoops to download it.",0
"A Mingus trubute to Ellington (and typical Mingus repackaging) If you are an Ellington/Strayhorn fan this 1960 album will grab you with some excellent renditions of Take the A Train and Do Nothing Until You Hear from Me that clearly have the Mingus touch.

Mingus had an unabashed admiration for Ellington, which probably culminated as a high point when he and Max Roach collaborated with Ellington on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-Jungle/dp/B000SZDMES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money Jungle</a>. Like that album, Max and Mingus are paired on this one. I must say that as much as I admire Max I prefer Dannie Richmond when paired with Mingus because the way Mingus and Richmond would stretch and compress time, almost telepathically, intrigues me. It also influences my own playing when I am with the right musicians. With Max none of that stuff happens.

The entire album is classic Mingus. Indeed, it was originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-Bird/dp/B000VRITJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre-Bird</a>, but in typical Mingus fashion it was repackaged. And, as if to underscore that, Mingus Fingus No. 2 on the original becomes Chazz Fingers No. 2 here.

Instead of my trying to dissect the tracks, just give them a listen from the sound samples on this page. If you are a Mingus fan, chances are you will like what you hear. If so, instead of immediately pulling the trigger, first check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Classic-Albums/dp/B0071XS3US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Classic Albums</a>, which is a value-priced set of Mingus albums and where I obtained my copy of this one.",1

"Soca. I asked my cousin on my Mom's side to help me get some current Soca on my playlist.  He mentioned Machel Montano.  My roots is actually Tobago, Trinidad's sister island.  When I was a little girl, my parents took me to Trinidad & Tobago often to visit, hearing my family members and friends talk is hilarious.  ""Push Bumper"" is a really cool Soca song.  Don't feel guilty if you giggle while listening to it, that is actually the way the T&T accent sounds.  The Tobagonian radio stations in Tobago played it a lot while I was visiting my Dad's house, still under construction in Tobago between June 2011 and early August 2011.  I had fun.
There is a lot of specific organized drums and a tiny organ like sound in the background which riddles the song throughout, making it sweet-sounding.  Machel's voice is robust and demanding.  Enjoy!!!!",0

Both LPs are very adventurous within an easy-listening paradigm. Both are impeccably arranged. ""Fandango"" holds together better as a whole, perhaps because it was intended for the latin american market, while ""Going Places"" is a bit more ""over the map"" in its selections. ""Going Places"" hit number one on the Billboard charts while ""Fandango"" didn't, but that was not for the lack of critical acclaim.

Seriously, if someone ever asks you to demonstrate the difference between good hip hop and bad hip hop, first have them listen to Bedrock and them show them this.

"A Strong Country Voice So, I have been a fan of Julie's for quite a while. I think I wore out her last CD ""Men and Mascara"". This album is a solid follow-up to that album. I applaud Julie for trying to break out of the slow country ballad trap with some fun, up-tempo songs. But clearly, Julie's plaintive voice is most potent when she's singing about heartache. Just one listen to ""Whiskey and You"", ""One for the Road"" or ""Yesterday's Blue"", and you will be a fan. Although this is not as cohesive an album as her last, I still love her voice, and I would recommend it to any country music fan. I hope she continues to flourish and attract fans because she is a true undiscovered talent.",1
"Spider-Who, now? What did this soundtrack have anything to do with a Spider-Man narrative? Might as well call it ""generic Bono album.""",0

"Not a bargain Dizzy Gillespie may be the greatest trumpet player in the history of jazz, and the listener will have some evidence of his genius on both sides of this scandalously ""under-documented"" recording.  Who knows where the music occurred and the names of the other musicians?  Any fan of Diz's artistry will have no difficulty distinguishing his trumpet among the cluttered sonics from which it emerges, but that's not enough reason to spend almost two dollars and the better part of an hour on a recording that merely demonstrates why a couple of anonymous, downloaded tracks are no substitute for the ""hard-copy CD.""  Sure, it's not a lot of money, and it's Dizzy Gillespie (who moreover was once a perpetual Presidential candidate),  but I suspect I'm not the only one who recognizes a rip-off at any price.",0
"Audio Quality Sucks I love this song but the audio quality sucks, It sucks on itunes also, I can't imagine the original recording at the
studio had the distortion that is in the mp3.

I'm really sick of wasting money on these compressed and compromised audio files.

"Jolie Holland is a great talent I love Jolie Holland's voice. She is so unique, there are no real comparisons. I guess one could liken her vocal earthiness to Lucinda Williams, if Lucinda sang the blues like Odetta. But really, you have to listen to this incredible woman and appreciate that she is unlike anyone else!",1
"I can't stand her voice! The musical setting of ""All Those Girls"" is pretty enough, but nothing special.  The lyrics, which speak of betrayal, are likewise nothing special, but they're not bad either.  I would have moderately enjoyed this song if not for one thing.

Jolie Holland's voice.

I don't have a problem with deep and husky voices, per se.  It was just last week that I gave a five-star review to Marianne Faithfull's ""Why Did We Have to Part,"" and I've adored Julia Fordham for years.  However, there's something about Holland's voice that just grates on me.  Maybe it's the way she slurs her words sometimes so that it's hard to make out exactly what she's singing (did she go right to the recording studio after a root canal or something?).  Maybe it's that her heavy, breathy huskiness reminds me of the voice of a longtime cigarette smoker.  Perhaps it's her whiny tone, or the way she seems to be trying to swallow and sing at the same time, or just a feeling I have that she cares more about her affected delivery - I mean, her ""unique style"" - than what she's singing.

Whatever it is, I don't like it.  It's not a terrible song, but I'd definitely recommend listening to the sample before you download.",0
"Fantastic album, truly gifted artist Been following Jeff Wood since last year.  Live near San Antonio so my friends, family, and I are fortunate enough to see him live quite often.
This album is my second favorite by him (Come What May being my favorite).  A few of the songs that stand out are Little Outlaw (my girlfriends' favorite), Wyoming Skies, Heroes, and Cell Phone Junkies.  Borrowed Time is very good.
The beats in his music are sometimes slow tempo, sometimes fast.  He has a wide range which is one of the reasons everyone who hears his music ends up enjoying it.
If you are tired of the same old music being put out by mainstream and are looking for something with substance, heart, and overall great music, then try this album.  His music always brightens my day.
As he always jokingly says at his shows ""This album is highly recommended by the artist"".
It's also highly recommended by me.",1
"Great new Christmas Bing This was an unexpected treasure found here.  I understand it's also available in Barnes & Noble now (12/2013).  This CD contains several Bing Christmas recordings that have never been on CD before, the most exciting to me is the inclusion of Bing reciting ""Night Before Christmas""!!  Also included is the rare original 45 ""Christmas Star"" and another one not on CD before is ""Away In the Manger"" taken from one of Bing's annual Christmas Eve Around The World broadcasts, this song includes his little woman singing along with Der Bingle.  Night Before Christmas & Away In Manger were both released only on a 45 just a couple years ago, but I didn't want to buy it on 45, I wanted it on CD.  So I was thrilled to see them finally now on CD.  OK, here's what you all want to know, ""What are the songs on this CD anyway???""
Here's the CD contents:
1. Rudolph Red Nosed Reindeer

2. Just What I Wanted For Christmas (Another great original 45 release from '60's)

3. Secret of Christmas (from the movie ""Say One For Me"")

4. Peace On Earth Little Drummer (can't stand this one, it's everywhere)

5. White World of Winter (Wow, another original 45 only release)

6. Let It Snow...

7. It's Christmas Time Again (one of my favorite Bing Christmas songs from '60's)

8. Marshmallow World w/Ella Fitzgerald

9. Good King Wenceslas

10. Joy To The World

11. Christmas Star (a great little original 45 release)

12. Little Town of Bethlehem

13. Away In A Manger (w/Lady Kathryn)

14. The Night Before Christmas (the real rare find for me the guy who already has everything Bing)",1

Nothing like taking the Invocation to Patanjali and applying a jingly treatment to the lyrics and a bouncy Caribbean music track.  She definitely doesn't ""Vande Gurunam"" to the great sage.  I guess she was thinking ""if it feels good then I say do it, I don't know what you're waiting for"" about a decade ago.",0

Perhaps Amazon could create audio samples from ""Sheeple"" that could help prospective buyers make draw their own conclusions.  Please don't write off Dave Perkins on the basis of this: I've been a fan since ""The Innocence"" came out back in 1987 and am eager to hear what he'll come out with next.",0

"O'Bryan ""surrenders"" his career after this! After three successful albums in the early 1980s and 7 R&B hit singles (one of them reaching #1, ""Lovelite""), O'Bryan finally releases his fourth and final effort by the end of 1986.  Even at his peak in 1984, O'Bryan still struggled a bit to reach the same success as many other R&B hit makers and now as of 1986, the competition was a lot tougher with Anita Baker, Janet Jackson, Loose Ends, and Freddie Jackson dominating the R&B charts that year.  Hip-Hop/rap music had already made a themselves a genre as nearly as equal to R&B and pop.  New Jack Swing music was slowly emerging by that point of which fused Hip-Hop and club oriented songs with R&B.

Since 1984's Be My Lover success, O'Bryan spent nearly 3 years coming up with a good follow up that would adapt to the change of pop/R&B music, but there was not much luck in those fields, however he managed to gain one last hit, ""Tenderoni"" (#35, R&B) that became a club hit in early 1987.  Unlike his previous albums, O'Bryan and Soul Train host, Don Cornelus didn't produce all of the songs.  O'Bryan recruited Jerry Knight (ex-Raydio member and ex-Ollie & Jerry fame) and Aaron Zigman to write and produce three of the 8 tracks that includes the slammin' ""Tenderoni"" and the sensitive and heartbreaking, ""You Have Got To Come To Me.""  The latter didn't chart, but in my opinion it sounds better than The Jets' 1986 hit, ""You Got It All"" (also produced by Knight and Zigman).  I think the 7 inch edited single version was better because the album version just repeats the chorus (too redudant), plus the sound quality wasn't that great.  The best song on the album has to be ""What Goes Around"" which was also produced by Knight and Zigman and is a tuff dance track that should have been his second single, but Capitol records blindly chose the silly ""Driving Force"" as a single instead.  The only O'Bryan/Cornelius produced song I enjoyed from this album would have to be ""Is This For Real"" of which is a sentimental and beautiful new jack ballad that was far longed overlooked.  Now that song is Surrender's best ballad.  Before someone sends their hate mail to me, I wasn't that fond of the ballad, ""Maria,"" but it wasn't his worst song.  The title track was a dissapointment (instrumental was a rip off of Luther Vandross' ""Give Me A Reason"") while ""Dreamin' Of You"" was musically and vocally ""way too busy and unappealing.""

""Tenderoni,"" ""What Goes Around,"" and ""Is This For Real"" were the only highlights of the lp with ""You Have Got To Come To Me"" rating 3.9 out of 5 (mid light). It was great that O'Bryan shared production duties with 2 top R&B producers, but I think many of the songs suffered from the repetitive chorus lines and instrumentals.  I think the album was sabatoged just like O'Bryan's career was shortly after the album's release.  It didn't help that there were many nasty rumors about O'Bryan circulating around the black music media that rode the passenger side with Capitol's bad deals for the 25 year old singer.  His dissappointment with the music industry prompted him to go on a early retirement from the business. Other than appearing on Karyn White's first album in 1988 (see linear notes) and Paul Jackson Jr's 1988 album, I Came To Play, as a featured vocalist, O'Bryan was non existent until 2007's mp3 (later cd) release, F1rst.  Out of all his albums that should be reissued and remastered to itunes, Surrender wouldn't have been much worth it.  I think Surrender would've done better with the wonder works of Reggie Calloway, LA Reid & Babyface, Nick Martinelli, and better yet Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis because O'Bryan definitely had the vocals and energy for their type of music.",0

"Remastered from Vinyl Been a big fan of JBA. He's so underrated and this is a great album long over due to be remastered. So I was really looking forward to this. I am very disappointed. To advertise this by Escape Records as a remaster is a joke. It is obvious by the clicks & pops & sporadic distortion, it's not from master taped but a vinyl transfer. My vinyl transfer I did is seriously better than this. This isn't the first time and I'm sure won't be the last. The record companies that do this should be ashamed to mislead people. The one plus is the artwork and packaging is top notch.",0

"Great way to learn Reform service prayers - for converts, interfaith partners This is a review of both Noah Aronson's album ""Left Side of the Page"" and ""Am I Awake"" - I listen to them all in one playlist.

Noah Aronson's music is great for helping out new converts to Reform Judaism, or the interfaith partner of a Reform Jew, or just really anyone who wants to know what a Reform Jewish religious service sounds like (so long as they use the prayerbook I mention below - which so far in my experience, most do).  All with some of the most beautiful voices out there, and really gifted musical arrangements.  I believe that Noah Aronson composed the melodies in this album (not positive on that though).

Several of the songs in Left Side of the Page and most of the songs in his other album, Am I Awake, follow along with one of the main Reform prayerbooks, Mishkan T'filah, which I personally find really beautiful in itself. When I was trying to find sources for Jewish service prayers and songs, almost all the prayers I could find were Orthodox or Consertative and didn't align to the services I was attending.  And many had (sorry to be judgmental, but this is music and it's hard not to notice!) really strident voices, too ""old opera-y"" voices, and/or awful accents in their Hebrew (eg ""Adonoy"" with an emphasis on the oy!).

This was a really nice change of pace - a guitar, a light male voice (tenor?), an easy switch back and forth between Hebrew and English, a light accent (more Israeli than Ashkenazi), pretty duets with pretty-voiced cantors and musicians (including one really cool Nickel Creek sounding guitar arrangement) and nice melodies.  A really nice, respectful, enjoyable listen - and a great way to learn your way through a service.

That said, if you're trying to learn how to chant prayers (some songs can be put to whatever music, while others have to be chanted according to the little squiggles in the Torah - sorry don't know the name of them), you should Google ""Temple Habonim V'ahavta"" and learn for free from Cantor Jodi Blankstein, who has an incredible voice.",1

"Look out -- mp3s made from an old record! Good music, what you'd expect from Hawkins & Webster . . .  Roy Eldridge sounds great too.

But look out! This version was mastered from a beatup vinyl record, not a master tape. Occasional surface noises are definitely noticeable on several tracks, including a scratch that makes an audible sound each time the turntable needle goes around and hits it again (on track 2).

This is a really weak move, and should have been mentioned in the album description.

It looks like the same material is available here on mp3 from another label as Ben Webster's YOUNG BEAN, and the previews there sound good as far as I can tell. You might want to spend a couple dollars more and get that recording rather than this one.",0

"Play That Thing These tracks are all really low volume for some reason. I had to use a sound manipulation program (Audacity) to amplify them.

According to a comprehensive online discography of Tommy Ladnier, there were six takes (not ""parts"") of ""Play That Thing"" --- a bluesy 1923 track with Jimmie Noone. This is the only mp3 source of takes 3 and 4 that I'm aware of. Each take is different enough that they are all interesting to me. You can search for mp3s and sort them all by length to separate out the different takes.

If you just want a decent collection of Tommy Ladnier, look elsewhere, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tommy-Ladnier/dp/B001W9CVLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tommy Ladnier</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1923-1939/dp/B00002791Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1923-1939</a>.

I highly recommend the tracks ""Play That Thing"" (esp. what is called here Part 1), ""Peepin' Blues,"" ""Muddy Water Blues"" (Jelly Roll Morton), ""Barrel House Blues"" (Ma Rainey), and the classic ""Really the Blues"" (Sidney Bechet), all of which contain Ladnier solos.

The 1943 soundtrack is not the same version as the Nintendo version.  However, I believe this version of the game can be found on Capcom classics for PS2.

And I have well used, poorly cared for, used vinyl that isn't as bad as this. It's really disappointing considering the music is quite good.

By it on CD, skip the vinyl.
---
Original Review:

The music is great however the vinyl comes loaded with dust and dirt. How a brand new vinyl can have so much dust and dirt, I don't know. As a result there's lots of pops and clicks which ruins the music since there are a lot of quite passages in the songs. Also the inner sleeve is too small for the record and it's torn on two edges before I've even removed the record.",0
"Deceptive advertising When you click on ""Zac Brown"" it comes up with the Zac Brown from the country band, Zac Brown Band and all their albums, making you think that this is a recording with that Zac Brown.  Which it is not.  This should be fixed as fans of the country Zac Brown Band are being misled to think this is him.",0
"Q's One Big Hit Isn't Available On CD - Yet In the annals of the One-Hit Wonder collection of musical artists, surely the group with the oddest band name was Q, a disco quartet in which all four contributed vocals as well as instruments (Robert Peckman bass, Don Garvin guitar, Bill Thomas keyboards and Bill Vogel drums). From Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, they met Mike Belkin and Carl Maduri of Cleveland who had just launched what was essentially a Disco music label, Sweet City, in the Cleveland suburb of Beachwood. This outfit had also worked out a distribution deal with Columbia's Epic subsidiary, and in 1977 they released this LP ""Dancin' Man"" (Epic 39641) containing: A1. Dancin' Man (2:38); A2. Do I Love You? (3:04); A3. Knee Deep In Love (3:08); A4. Feel It In Your Backbone, Got It In Your Feet (4:03); A5. Have I Sinned? (3:05); B1. Sweet Summertime (2:42); B2. If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another (3:17); B3. Feelin' That Rhythm To The Bone (2:41); B4. Make Us Once Again (r:17); B5. Jump For Joy (2:44).

When it started its climb to a modest # 140 on Billboard's album charts, the single Dancin' Man was rushed out as Epic/Sweet City 50335), eventually reaching # 23 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late March/early April 1977 b/w Love Pollution (not part of the album). A later single from that album,  Sweet Summertime, topped out at # 108 Hot 100 Bubble Under in July b/w If It Ain't One Thing It's Another (Epic/Sweet City 50404), but in August, Feel It In Your Backbone, Got It In Your Feet b/w Jump For Joy as Epic 50440 failed to make either chart.

It's probably unrealistic to think that a distributor would bother putting out a CD version of this album (perhaps Collector's Choice) in light of the fact they are such an obscure gathering, but it is surprising that their one big hit - and a # 23 wasn't a bad result considering the fact that over 450 songs made the Billboard Pop Hot 100 that year - has never even made its way into a multiple-artist compilation covering music of the Disco era. And there are a lot of them out there.",1
Streaming what? Streaming only. The sound quality on the streaming version of this magnificent recording is unspeakably awful.,0
mistake I downloaded this song by mistake. I don't even remember purchasing it or what I thought it was because I don't think I would have downloaded Lionel Richie's song with the same name as this album either. Big mistake.,0

"Very bad job recording I love this Concerto, but my disc broke. I purchased this as a replacement, unfortunately the recording job is horrible. Lots of background static, the volume is too low in comparison with the norm, which is a shame since the orchestra sounds good. Guess I'll have to look over a few before I purchase this Concerto again.",0
Disappointing! A disappointing rendition of Ketelbey. Excessive variation in audio from very loud to very soft--so soft you can hardly hear it.,0
"Highly Recommend This Wonderful Record Just purchased this record to get a replacement sleeve for an existing have of this album. This is a very good Billy Vaughn recording. Even though there are others ""Summer Place"" is this oldest BV record I have in my collection. Dot's Ultra High Fidelity recording produced some of the very best stereo records I have ever heard and Biily Vaughn was certainly a very talented musician. The arrangements and studio mixing on these songs are first rate. Highly recommend if can find a very good or better used record. I happened to pick my copy at Goodwill for only one dollar. It only needed some cleaning. After that it has spinning regularly on my turntable.",1

Five Stars good thank you,1
"Very Disappointed I was so disappointed.  Much of the content was read from one of Dr. Hallowell's books, that I already had.  I thought the price was pretty high to begin with and then, after listening to the cd, felt really ripped off.
If you've never read his books, then you might like this.  The information is good.  I just felt like I had been 're-gifted' and paid WAY too much.",0
"Great Emotion I love this song!  I first heard this song on ""Deadliest Catch.""  It was used as a quite appropriate season closer when Captain Phil Harris passed.  This song has lyrics, melody, and building power that will grab you as a listener.

If you have read any of my other reviews (dexspinner) you know I purchase tons, yes tons, of music because I am a professional fitness instructor.  I have used this song in Yoga, Pilates, and as a cool down to almost every class.  It also is great for listening and I have shared it with countless friends and exercise participants.",1
"Far More Precious I personally know Vince and have had an LP record of this from its original pressing,  But I no longer have a record player to play it.  So I went online and downloaded it to my Kindle so that I could listen to it again.  I am so glad that I can listen to his music at anytime I want.",1
"By a non-synthesized version for the same price It's the same orchestration as the original soundtrack, but it's played by a bad synthesizer instead of an orchestra. Listen to the preview, then purchase the original track or the London Music Works version for the same price.",0

"I purchased this #22 coupled with a Zacharias/Leitner ...#24, and kept the cd because Zacharias rarely ornaments in #24 and plays it as well as he can, at a B/B- level I believe.  However, Leitner submits his third A+ #24 after five star versions with Kempff and Seemann, so that #24 deserves four stars overall.  I am guessing (only) that Leitner forbade CZ's customary intrusions. In #22 with Kord, though, he has free rein and,I believe, wrecks this great concerto (Mozart's third greatest after #s 24 and 25  I believe). The other movements are mutilated further. Both Brendel/Marriner and Larrocha/Segal and Davis employ ornamentation in their readings, and Brendel does very little of it in his fine version with Paul Angerer on Vox (see my review). However they are ascetic  compared to Zacharias. Of course
this is a subjective judgment, but even if the ornamentation here isn't annoying, other pianists perform the concerto
more effectively, including Brendel/Marriner/Philips, de Larrocha/Segal/Decca, Brendel/Angerer/Vox, Larrocha/Davis/RCA, Haebler/Davis/Philips, Kempff/Klee/DG, Annie Fischer/Sawallisch/EMI, Edwin Fischer/EMI and Peter

"A gift and the receiver loved it It was a gift, but the receiver loved it!",1
"Bour Conducts Mozart Symphonies I agree with the other reviewers regarding this set as a whole. I'll just add comments I made on a previous issue of ten of the symphonies on the Quadromania label in the middle of the last decade.

Ernest Bour conducts the SWF Radio Symphony Orchestra in ten Mozart symphonies, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, and 38-41. The recordings were done between 1964 and 1978, and released on Aurophon LPs. Membran licensed the tapes from Cascade, the owner, in 2004 for this set.

I've listened to four of the symphonies, 25, 29, 35, and 39. The sound is dry and clear. Membran doesn't say when each work was recorded (another issue lists a recording date of January 1978 for 39 and 40), and they all clearly come from different sessions, but there's little difference between them. Bour's interpretations seem very straightforward in the best possible way. He doesn't dawdle in slow movements, he doesn't cover up wind and brass lines but he doesn't emphasize them, nothing sounds rushed.... it's hard to find something strikingly 'right' that Bour does, but that's because everything feels right as it is. I can hear the pitfalls he avoids, for example making the first movement of the Haffner ponderous - Bour's is 'crisp' like Szell, but warmer, less clipped. His 39 reminds me of Szell's as well, although gentler. (Szell was my ""imprint"" version, for what it's worth.) His 25 and 29 are good, and Bour avoids the temptation to be cloying in the latter symphony, but Marriner's early Phillips recordings get more out of these early works and are better recorded and played. Then again, Marriner's Academy Of St. Martins in the Fields is hardly ""big band"" Mozart, so it's not the best comparison to Bour.

Continuing through the set, 40 receives a top-notch performance. 41, which I'm listening to now, is pretty good too, with some wonderfully hushed playing in the second movement. I've listened to 28, 40, 41, and 29 again since my initial comments, and my enthusiasm for this set grows. The sound is slightly boxy, but not to the point its annoying.

Cascade Media had a 40 CD Mozart box available a couple of years ago, which contained the Bour Symphonies from the Quadromania set and this X5 download, as well as the Magic Flute excerpts. I purchased that set for 20 bucks plus shipping, and if you can find it, get it, as it contains the Carmen Piazzini recordings of the piano concertos and piano sonatas, as well as a complete set of the violin concertos. This download is a good alternative if you can't get the Cascade set at a reasonable price.",1
"Very good Mozart and an excellent bargain This is a very good set of Mozart, and for the price is one of the best deals on Amazon's MP3 site. Germany's SWR (S&uuml;dwestrundfunk, or Southwestern Radio) Orchestra is a quality ensemble and the playing here is all very good to excellent.

It's refreshing that this isn't a ""best of Mozart"" set -- except for some ""Magic Flute"" excerpts, these are all full-length works. And although a number of very familiar pieces are included, such as the Sinfonia Concertante or the Jupiter Symphony, it is not a set of Mozart you've already heard a hundred times.

I did hear an occasion or two where I thought some attacks were a little clumsy -- not intentionally fuzzy as in the Furtw&auml;ngler style, but just a bit muddled. But these were very few and far between and did not mar the set overall. While these are generally not performances that will beat the best out there, they are all highly competent and enjoyable. Very worthwhile as great music well played, and worth a very warm recommendation at the bargain price (right now $4.99, although I paid a little more).",1
"Something I've been missing from the music of today Wow, what an absolute joy it was listening to this music.

"I really like Sybreed, and I really like this specific song I really like Sybreed, and I really like this specific song. It's really catchy and all around a great track. I love the vocal effects. I don't think the 3 remixes were really necessary, and if they were, they should have charged less for this EP. The remixes are all very similar in sound and feel: very heavily influenced by hip hop/electronic music, with each remix having just some minor tweaks. I only ever listen to the original track",1

"Big Band Jazz John Vanore has an ensemble called Abstract Truth that contains some of the more remarkable musicians before the public today.  This, his third album CONTAGIOUS WORDS, is just that - contagious.  Rarely has a big band ensemble demonstrated such cohesive communication while at the same time having each of the members be solo quality artists.  The album has eight remarkable tracks, six of them being compositions by John Dqvore and the other two are well known standards - 'You Go to My Head' and 'Neopolis'.

The performances are clean, well recorded and of the quality that burns on the mind long after each piece is played.  As Davore states 'It's all about storytelling - experiences that bring us deeper into understanding ourselves and those around us.  Music uniquely has the ability to touch us without the use of word or image...and in its abstract existence (the medium of sound) there is a truth in this means of conveying emotion and touching the spirit of the listener...CONTAGIOUS WORDS  collects many of these stories and experiences.'

So off and running is Abstract Truth with some of the most exciting 'big band' sounds around. The members are so important that they all deserve mentioning: John Davore, trumpet and flugelhorn, Michael Mee, alto an dsoprano sax and flute, Bob Howell, tenor and soprano sax/bass clarinet/flute, Joe Cataldo, Sean McAnally, Tony DeSantis, Bill Pusey, Kevin Rodgers - all on trumpet and flugelhorn, George Barnett, french horn, Fred  Scott and Larry Toft, trombone, Craig Thomas, acoustic and electric bass, Dan Monaghan, drums - with Ron Thomas, piano, Heather Fortune, flute, and Jim Daniels, bass trombone.  They are all stars, but the project that comes out to the listener is the gift of the very highly esteemed John Vanore.  Grady Harp, March 11",1

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): WireRose - From The End EP (Independent)
Currently causing a stir in their home state of Georgia, where their unsigned status is the source of considerable bewilderment, WireRose continue unfazed with the job in hand - making music. Their latest, the five-track ""From The End EP"" consolidates their ultra-hip modern rock sound, building upon 2009's ""Waiting"" album and securing their status as a band to look out for.

There's a hint of `epic' in what they do, in their lyrics and playing, the resulting sound might best be described as progressive, though we're talking the Radiohead / Mansun school of prog rather than the `70s version, with plenty of post-punk urgency, especially in the guitars, to dispel any thoughts of excess. Their scale is reflected in the length of their songs; the five tracks here spread out over 22 minutes, though there's hardly a second wasted.

Opening track ""Trip Away"" is simultaneously effortless and abrasive, like classic psychedelia strained through a contemporary mesh. The title track dovetails `80s and `90s indie with right now, and again layers some wonderfully exciting guitar playing, the sort of thing that takes you back to the first time we heard Robert Smith or The Edge. ""Monster"" may lack a little of the intensity of other tracks but more than compensates with a chunky, choppy rhythm and the most insistent of choruses. If they're going to get on the radio, that's the one.",1

The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.

"Dont buy this! I regret this purchase and DO NOT RECOMMEND. After buying This I found out there is an app for way less $ that is 100x better. This app tricked us into a few tourist traps, it had us turning around multiple times trying to find an obscure place that wasn't as great as other places. It is outdated and full of advertisements for places along the way. This cd made our trip a lot less amazing than it could have been, and is one of my only regrets about my trip to Maui",0

Five Stars Great song ! Instant classic,1
"Not what it seems... Thought I was getting a ""Best Of"" and didn't bother previewing the songs. These are all re-recorded versions of the songs that sound nothing like the original. They all sound like they've been disco-ized. Buyer beware!",0

"Pregnancy Meditation I was really excited to get a few pregnancy meditation cd's.  I wish I had realized how short this one was before I spent $8.99 to buy the MP3's!  It is ok for a short meditation but if you are looking for something that lasts longer, skip this one! If you have any experience with guided meditation, I do not recommend this cd, it just doesn't have enough substance.",0
"One of the best finds in Prime Music Liszt was possibly the great piano virtuoso of his day, in an era where technique was under constant exploration by the best of the best. Every technique that his rivals singly mastered, Liszt mastered as well. He was a rock star of the day's concerts, and the fact that there was no way to record his performances for later years leaves a hole in the universe.

We can, however, imagine the skill he displayed in performance by gauging the demands of his compositions. And his compositions are voluminous and filled with constant delights.

Here we have 34 CDs full, a treasure trove of masterful performances of one of the brightest stars to ever shine on the field of piano composition. Hours of pleasure.",1

"Fool! I listened to this track about 6 times and it was 6 times too many. This nobody trying to get paid by dissin Hova! The hook is weak as is his attempt to steal the beat. This guy need to be put 6 feet under! Jay-Z is tha MAN! I haven't seen anyone besides Dr. Dre and Jay-Z be this influential in the game. Now you can put Eminem and 50 Cent in that category, but this was a complete waste of time to listen to. He only did it so he can try to sell records. He must not reallize that Hova has millions of fans worldwide that won't buy his garbage. Jada and 50 had a fun beef going with two talented spitters. This guy sux!",0
"Like it Not sure I how I got this in my playlist, but I like it.  Good KROQ kind of song.  Anthemy rock with a smidgen of understated pop.  I don't get sick of hearing it on my iPod.",1

"Totally Satisfied!!! While converting part of my late uncle's collection of LPs to CD, I found Ernie's LP recording of Civil War Sngs of the North. One listen convinced me I had to have the companion recording of Songs of the South.  I was not disappointed.  These are truly outstanding albums in every way; song selection, performance, arrangements, and technical quality.  A a life long audio geek since the 50's I know of what I speak and these recordings by Capitol, released in 1961 cannot be beat.  BTW, the vinyl LP digital conversion and the MP3 download are esentially of equal quality.  Totally satisfied!",1

Five Stars Perfect!!!!!,1
"Bernstein and Corelli Make This A Must This was of course a unique situation, with Bernstein conducting Cav of all things. Those who complained that he was out of his element here had better check the score. By dusting off many traditional cobwebs, he brought this to life as if it were a new work he was trying to promote. Domingo had previously been scheduled for this production, but the labor problems which so delayed the '69, '70 season produced various temporary defections, including the young Spaniard's. Corelli took over, and did he take over! At that time, young Domingo could never have approached Corelli in this one, particularly in this form and cooperating fully with Bernstein. There's no doubt who's in charge, but Corelli much more than makes up for his relatively sloppy performance on his commercial set of Cav, where his scooping seriously mars the ""Addio"". This time, he delivers the best Turiddu I have ever heard. The Operatic Ear, anotheramerica.org",1

Great tune! The Great Romance is such a talented group of musicians and this is a great song! Great beat with beautiful lyrics.,1
Quality of the song left something to be desired This version of the song sounds like it was recorded in my friends garage studio.  Very hollow and echo'y (word?).  I would recommend waiting for her real album to come out. The AI version doesn't sound very good.,0

Highly Recommend!! This is a great cd and I would highly recommend it to anyone who just loves all music genres.,1

"Not Eric Clapton... ""Classical Gas"" is an instrumental musical piece composed and originally performed by Mason Williams. Originally released in 1968 on the album The Mason Williams Phonograph Record.
There is a common misconception that ""Classical Gas"" was composed and performed by Eric Clapton. Clapton has never recorded a cover of the song. This misconception may possibly be attributed to the fact that Clapton was musical director of, and played much of the guitar music for, the feature film The Story of Us. The version of the song on the film's soundtrack is actually Williams's own solo-guitar re-recording of it, from his 1970 album Handmade.",0

"Great song for my daughter, but problems by downloading She likes Selena Gomez a lot, and this is one of her favorite songs.  Great, great sound!  The thing is that you have to download Amazon downloader, and once you have done it, it doesn't work, so I had to download the song manually.  Without Amazon downloader, you have to go song by song.",1

Takes you back to the days of Mr. Magic, and Uncle Ralph (Video Music Box). When you know the rap game and you're down with The Old School, you're not down with the New Fools.

"Captain Howdy. The 45 was almost new condition was in jacket with original studio logo, gave it a spin on the old record player really good quality.
Captain Howdy is a demon mentioned in the original Exorcist by Lindas Blairs character . Sometimes there is a thrill that clicks with an activity and people are drawn in and hooked on unwholsome things. Some of this is spiritual.  A Wholesome life is just damage control, bad things are gonna get ya sooner or later. Demons want you discredited , destroyed and dead before you you can find Jesus.
I bought this 45 to help ""Demonstrate"" the point to some youngsters in and around my life. It is collectable rock and roll and some of my daughters friends seem to like that and I can use it to make a point about how easy it is to invite things in that will destroy your life.  Earth is a self cleaning oven continually remaking its self through corruption. Salvation and purity through Jesus only.",1

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): TapWater - Too Dark To Blink (Independent)
TapWater are a six-piece Americana group based in Portland, Oregon, slowly but surely building their reputation through a series of well received releases and a busy concert schedule. Such is their growing status, their latest album, ""Too Dark To Blink"" has attracted various high profile guest turns, including several members of Los Lobos. Indeed, Steve Berlin produces and plays saxophone and melotron. Not two instruments that are naturally associated with an Americana band, but when you consider that frontman Rudy Slizewski also contributes steel drums, xylophone, trombone and marimba, and other listed instruments include lap harp and flugelhorn, it's probably best to chuck those stereotypical expectations out of the window.

Thanks to Berlin's production (and the band's experience) it's somewhat remarkable that ""Too Dark To Blink"" doesn't ever feel cluttered or clumsy. The sound is full and rounded, and the variety of instruments is beautifully judged. When the steel drum makes an appearance on ""Drownin' Without Love"" it's a genuine moment of joy, and they repeat the trick on ""See Ya Maria"", though it's mixed gently with lead guitar. Tracks like ""Frankie Leigh"" and ""Big Belly Blues"" make comparisons with early Wilco and The Band fully justified and the short but very serious, almost classical, ""With My Curtains Closed"" indicates a band willing to take on anything, and able enough to prevail. Recommended.",1
"nothin from nothing is nothing One of your reviewers compared it to water boarding I agree and hope the CIA uses it along with a video of rappers on mute and this as the music track. Confusing?
I gave it a one because I had to do something,right now I'm taking that one star back.",0
"""No One"" ..must be the target audience I concur with the previous review. Based on the sample its simply a repeating beat.. should get a lot of downloads from Guantanamo Bay though as it is a great alternative to water-boarding.",0
"Um, what? Maybe if I actually knew Federico Aubele's ""Bohemian Rhapsody in Blue,"" the song of which this is a remix, I would be able to appreciate this - but somehow I don't think so.  This remix consists of the same beat played over and over throughout, with some occasional other sounds in the background, and the same two snippets of vocals repeated in a faintly appealing arrangement that becomes tedious long, long before the three and a half minutes of this track are up.  I haven't known many folks who could manage to carry a tune while mumbling indifferently, but that seems to be Aubele's style.  Unless you're that persistent eccentric who has taken it as her personal mission to review the Amazon Free MP3 of the Day every day (and, lest there be any confusion in this regard, you're not), I can't think of a single good reason to listen to this dull exercise in cut-and-paste.",0

"Wow, this is really not done well While I appreciate the attempt to recreate the song and all its ambiance, the vocalist just is not strong enough to pull off this song.  The underlying music is fairly accurately recreated, But with todays electronics that is to be expected.  What sets Enigma's music apart is their strong haunting vocals, expertly mixed and balanced with the music.
Sadly this just doesn't cut it.  Do yourself a favor and just download the real thing, listen to both and you will see just how pale this is in comparison.",0

"You can do better I want to start by making one thing clear: Mickey Thomas is one of my all time favourite male rock vocalists and I love his work with Starship.

So, it's with a heavy heart I write this review. This is simly put a terrible album. His voice sounds great, but I don't want to hear an album with covers. The worst song without a doubt is the Hip Hop mix version of ""Life is a Highway"", closely followed by ""Money Talks"". No, no and NO. ""Hollywood Nights"" is the only song i find OK.

I would love to see someone provide him with new melodic rock songs and make an album that makes his great voice justice. Come on Mickey, you can do better than this!",0

These guys have amazing talent and the ability to blend rock, folk, Irish-, Gypsy-, and Slavic- styles of music, with a wonderful blend of original pieces and classic favorites.  I first met them when they performed at my Alma Mater while they were in the area for an Irish Festival, and I've been hooked ever since.  Not since a good decade ago when I was in high school has a band earned such a coveted and nearly unmoved spot in my CD player!",1
"Woo Meets Jazz First.  I don't write many musical reviews.  I prefer to spend my time either playing or listening.  Second.  A disclaimer: Yes I am A BW fan; however, I have not been shy about expressing my honest opinion about his various projects.  That said, I love these tracks.  I have always wondered what BW would sound like playing straight-ahead Jazz.  I can still hear elements of the ""Parliament days"" sound.  Those weird ""irks and quirks"" that are BW signatures.  As a matter of fact, I was expecting an all acoustic CD, but was surprised to hear those vintage electronic keyboard sounds.  My favorites are his versions of Take 5, and Watermelon Man. Both stick fairly close to the original melodies, but they are definitely BWs interpretation of the tunes.  I boil things down simply:  Would Herbie Hancock like BW's version of Watermelon Man?  I bet so.  Would Dave Brubeck like ""Take 5?""  I bet.  Antonio Carlos Jobim would appreciate ""Agua de Beber"" ... and so on.  BW's whimsical approach to music reminds me of another one of my heroes: Thelonious Monk.  Both men seem to just hear what they hear, and play what they play.  So I'm thrilled BW is taking a minute to play Jazz.

Respectfully Submitted;

"Woo - less Alert! Caveat Emptor! OK, it's official: I'm old. I MUST be old; all these people who were the firebrands of my youth are making these discs/records/recordings - whatever you call them nowadays - where they show that they are ""mature"" in some sort of way. What way is demonstrated on this one? Well, none really - if you judge it by the way it sounds. But Jazz, as a signifier, represents something like ""a more advanced, more reflexive musicianship"". I call BS - really! This is a Jazz record the way hearing the theme of Blowin' In The Wind over Muzak in a supermarket is Rock. The only thing that remains from the brilliance that Mr. Worrell demonstrated in the past is an enormous sensitivity to the vast tonal and emotional palette that ""keyboards"" are capable of - he really changed that game, especially in terms of how Pop producers used those instruments. This is audible here, for example, on You're My Thrill where both subtle and not - so - subtle shifts of vibrato function somewhat as they do in the tenor sax playing of a Ben Webster. There are some little pleasures like this to be found here. But they are far and few between. Most of the time, there is a plodding repetition of themes, toneless wanking substituting for improvisation...all of this accompanied by a crack team of top level Downtown New York Freelancers who were, I'm sure, constantly high - fiving each other in the studio between takes, telling each other how ""killing these tracks are"". Well, you can sleep the sleep of the just, henchmen; you did the best that you could do, given the dire circumstances. And, publicist, too, you did your job - NPR profile about how aging Funkmeister goes back to his Jazz roots, etc.,etc., ad nauseum, blah, blah, blah...It's not your fault either. Is it Bernie's fault? I don't want to denigrate the man who added so much genius to Flashlight, Funkentelechy, Chocolate City and so many other Funk Masterpieces. I'd rather just call it - sad. Weak and sad.",0

"'S Wonderful This one I discovered through Bob Parlocha's list, and being a big band fan I had to give it a chance. In this recording the Gran Canaria Big Band pays homage to Broadway musicals with a unique big band sound - with several Gershwin musicals, and to the Count Basie Big Band.  I really enjoyed Laura Sim's singing, with lots of feeling and energy. Fawncy meeting you here and S'Wonderful are two of the highlights. These musicians really know what they are doing, just listen to the solos and big band unison in Spanky and really come out swinging full of energy. The Broadway touch and Laura Sim's singing really set it apart from many other big band recordings.",1

Cluck Old Hen So I just got back from the Midwest Banjo Camp and heard Mabus play this song during the staff concert.  He had us spellbound.  It was the highlight of the night. It ran close to 8 minutes I think and I would have been happy if he doubled that. What Mabus shows is that a few simple phrases are more powerfull than a wall of notes. Now he certainly played around with the standard melody but he was never unfair to it.  Well done Mabus.,1

I preview the songs and they sounds more like some sort of head banger heavy metal with really loud distorted noise that you can't understand anything.  Maybe it is a mistake of the seller to upload the wrong files.  No Khmer words, not Khmer music, - no buy. Do do buy any of these thinking it's Khmer music.",0

"Not a Good Buy! Out of all the CD's I've ordered from Amazon, there was only 1 song on here that was truly worth keeping. The rest I was completely disappointed with and should have just bought and downloaded that one song.",0
"Four Stars Cool jazz, I like it",1
Where is my music? I don't have it. I paid for the song but don't know where it is. I paid but can not listen to the music.,0
Great tune! I prefer this version. The original is good too but this is much more melodious( no pun intended). The choir and I think the piano or whatever instrument that is giving off that funky tune. I really like it,1
"Not really my cup of tea I caught a snippet of this tune in the car and it sounded okay, so I bought it (actually, I think it was free).  It makes me think of those packs of ditzy junior-high girls who got mommy to dump them at the mall for the afternoon...kinda mindless and boring and empty and a little annoying.  It feels machine-generated (sometimes I think popular music is being written by software nowadays and this is a good example of that).  This would be suitable for inclusion on a playlist belonging to one of the aforementioned ditzy junior-high-schoolers.  (Disclaimer: grumpy old man here, way out of the demographic this was intended for.)",0

"This set has its problems Warning: I recommend you avoid this.  This set of mp3 files is of unusually poor quality for an Amazon download (this is the first time I've ever written a review like this).  The background to all the pieces is full of scratches and it sounds like these were transferred from a record to mp3 files without cleanup.  And the Ravel La Valse mp3 file starts with the ending bars of the Dukas Sorcerer's Apprentice, then a blank gap, and then the Ravel starts more than half a minute into the file.

If anybody at Amazon reads this, I'd like my money back please, even if it was only $3.56.",0

One Star Half songs not very happy with this cd at all,0
I don't understand this cd I came across this album and I just find it to be weird. I'm a hardcore Eminem fan and never heard of this. This isn't underground or anything. What's weird is there's no editorial reviews or customer reviews. The album seems to have songs I never heard of. No mp3s for the songs either. It says that it came out in july 2011. But he never made anything in 2011 solo especially since he dropped hell the sequel less than a month earlier to when this is supposedly released. I would not buy this because most likely it's a scam,0
Great job Typically great Anne Murray music. Very uplifting.,1
Five Stars Serious brass players should have this one.,1
"Louis Armstrong: the re-creational approach This MIGHT be a nice way to introduce Louis Armstrong, New Orleans and 20s jazz to new audiences, but for us old school jazz fans,
digitally re-recording of Louis Armstrong classic sides
seems quite counterintuitive (in many respects it's hardly jazz at all when you try to copy old recordings).

For me this will be, at best, a background CD, in spite of all the respectable musical and technological effort put into this project.

It just doesn't seem right (and putting original and new but not-really-magnificent vocals in the middle of the recreations doesn't really help either).",0
"If Tori Amos still had new ideas... Soulful and sexy-  Elizabeth Rose's evocative voice and style is reminiscent of Tori Amos.  But where Tori lost me years ago with being repetitive and uninspired, Rose continues to produce stirring, frequently weird (in a good way) songs.",1

I wasted money on this track as most of it is complete garbage in it's entirety. Because this is a digital purchase, one is stuck with it and the money cannot be refunded. Much like all other music purchases. Not pleased in the least! Total garbage",0
"NO TIN BUCKET MUSIC IN THIS ALBUM! Finally, many of the traditional marches NOT remastered and sounding like they were recorded in a tin bucket.  Never heard of the orchestra before today, but the recordings are professional.  A number of non-marches in there, but they are great pieces, too.  For this price one can get them all and not feel cheated by pulling out half a dozen favorites and never listening to the rest.  But no not me!  Once upon a generation or so ago I was in a a marching band, and this genre of music still stirs me.  No tin bucket music in this album!",1

"A cacophonous din If you're into the roots-rock kind of thing, you might like this.  It sounds sort of like a wild punker such as a higher-voiced, Stooges-era Iggy Pop fronting the Stray Cats.  There are brief & loose sax & electric guitar solos.  For me, though, roots-rock has to be more polished than this, more like Dave Alvin or something like that (even John Doe).  This Dex song is too buzz-saw, too wildly sung, too rough around the edges... (etc.)",0

Horrible remake.  Leave the original the way it is. This is not the original... and it is horrible.,0
TERRIBLE QUALITY OF MUSIC DOWNLOAD CAREFUL WITH THIS QUALITY OF DOWNLOAD - NOT THE BEST VERY LOW VOLUME AND RANGE ON THIS EDITION OF MP3.,0
"Tripped in the dark... While I like the beat to this song, I must admit that the vocals are just not pleasant to the ears.  Sure, there is a softness and an overall breezy feel to the bulk of the vocals, but in the end it comes off almost shrill.  It's far too whiney for its own good; resorting to off-putting repetitions (don't make me wait) at the end of the song that make me want to turn it off immediately.  There is a bouncy, almost childlike quality to the song, but the production values are dim, with the vocals taking such a backseat that the get lost in the musical arrangement, which is simply effective but doesn't maintain the pop it initiates (even with the beat switch up towards the end).  There is a moment, before the shrillness takes over, during a pre-bridge (that I want her to stay up for the whole night) where I was actually taken over by this feeling of intrigue, as if maybe this song was going to turn around and then it plunged off the edge of irritation with horrific vocals.

Personally, I'm not interested in getting to know Memory Tapes any better.",0
Two Stars Wrong group but the songs are kind of OK.,0
Five Stars Thank You,1

"Bad CD - A Big Disappointment I heard of Sahara Smith the night she performed on a Prairie Home Companion in 2003, and was looking forward to her CD for a long time.  She seemed sincere and had a nice voice and wrote two good songs, and performed them well then.

8 years later she releases this vague set of 'yeah, yeah, yeah' (never heard those lyrics in a song before!) mediocre, boring croonings that does not even include a decent performance of Twilight Red, which she performed better on a Prairie Home Companion at the age of 15.  Now it just sounds way too sad in a bad way and too slow and lugubrious.

Her best song - from that night 8 years ago - Don't Rain Much - is not included on the album.

This girl is so lost and confused.  She sounds bored.  She was all motivated and proud then, and now is all vague and uncertain and singing songs about not knowing what truth is.  Very disappointing to hear her sounding  . . . just like everybody else.

Read Atlas Shrugged, Sahara, you'll learn something, and you'll have something life-positive to write about.",0
"NOT ACTUALLY ABBA. I accidentally bought this thinking it was ABBA. It is a cover band, ""tribute band"" whatever.  NOT REALLY ABBA.",0
"Big disappointment I'm a big fan of Dmitri Hvorostovsky's singing and had viewed some songs from the Deja Vu album on youtube.  I was looking forward to playing my own album and interested to hear more of his crossover music which had been highly praised.  But the disc was a huge let-down, mainly because of its unbalanced mix - all the songs overpowered by a thumping bass and facile orchestration.  His voice is still beautiful and his diction - in three languages - is excellent, but he would have done better to sing a cappella, the mix was so bad.  And then - to add insult to injury - the DVD of Toi et Moi !!!  What on earth induced him to introduce chains, whips and a woman screaming in .... pleasure? Anguish? Who knows?  Who cares?  Whatever it was, it was ludicrous, cliches stacked on top of cliches in a package that would have been offensive if it wasn't so laughable.  I think I'm still a fan of Hvorostovsky - singing opera and Russian folk songs - but this album does nothing to enhance his reputation and I won't be playing it again.  In fact, I'd give it away if there's anyone out there who wants to go to the trouble of letting me know where I can send it to.",0

"My choir teacher was correct! After discussing performances of this work through emails, my choir teacher from my high school days (a long time ago), told me to play the Shaw version, which we both liked, and then purchase this version. He had sent me a YouTube connection that was this recording from an old, scratchy LP. It sounded terribly slow and, of course, hard to listen to in its scratchy state. He ASSURED me that the CD version had far better sound and that the tempos are considered by most choral music scholars as definitive. I reluctantly agreed to listen once it arrived. First, I listened to my copy by Shaw and his singers: wonderful sound. Then I played this recording. Well, my teacher was AGAIN correct. The sound was very good, if a bit skewed to the left, and the performance was, well... (I'm not a singer any longer, and I don't have the sheet music), but it was just RIGHT. the listener can just sense the rightness to these pieces. And the BASSES! They anchor the work with incredible power. The subterranean b-flat at the end of track 5 is worth the price of admission. Just wonderful!",1

Five Stars Rings true especially today.,1
"I didn't like it at all. I had a frustrating time with this CD. I am a new singer and I was hoping this would help me strengthen my voice while I drive.

The music is very professional, on an electric keyboard. The guy sings the combination once through at the beginning of each exercise. But each exercise is complicated, like ""Ha-he-hee-hee-la-la-loo-loo-e-i-e-i-oh"" (every syllable a different note). Instead of playing the melody that I need to sing along with, he plays background chords and I am struggling to remember the melody that I am supposed to be singing. Then he keeps interjecting ""helpful"" things during the exercise like ""Remember to relax your jaw"", ""Be sure to breathe properly"". Then I am even more lost because I am still struggling with the melody that I am supposed to be singing and he is talking over the chords and I don't know where I am. Then, during the SAME exercise, he will change the sound I am supposed to be singing, ""Now sing it with ""Yaw-yaw-yaw, instead of Yee-yee-yee"" (or whatever). More frustration and demands while he is pounding out chords and I am lost and I have no idea what the melody is. Not fun. Not helpful. Too confusing. After the third exercise, I just gave up.

I would have rather simpler melodies, stick with the same sounds per exercises, and play the melody instead of chords so I know where I am supposed to be, and stop interrupting.",0

"Super Duper Kuroki chan one of the secret Jpop talents!  she can sing, sexy too!",1
"One of the best J-Pop singles of 2011 ""Wired Life"" marked a strong move into a much more hard edged Techno sound for Meisa Kuroki, who has been previously involved in much more RnB styled music. ""Wired Life"" is at 128 Beats Per Minute and it would make a good late night club groove - the verses of the song have an elegantly brooding mood to it contrasted with a powerful but poised chorus. If you like the music of Goldfrapp, Little Boots, La Roux or perhaps Miss Kittin, then you will like this song from Meisa Kuroki. If you're well versed in Japanese music, this song is probably closer to the music of Perfume, Kotoko or Saori@destiny.
Meisa Kuroki sings with a strong clear adult pop-soprano voice with no vocal affectations. Unlike some of her peers, she doesn't go in for the use of vocoders or other electronic vocal treatments of her voice.

There are four versions of ""Wired Life"" offered here - the standard song, which clocks in at just over four and a half minutes. There's an instrumental version, which shows just how good the electronic music is in this song. A mix with dialogue from the anime and a short anime version.

A further version of ""Wired Life"" appears on Meisa Kuroki's more recent single, ""Woman's Worth"".

Hopefully, a new album by Meisa Kuroki is in the works. I think that 2012 will be a big year for Ms Kuroki, and Nami Tamaki, too, whose new single ""Lady Mind"" could be the ""sister"" single of ""Wired Life"".

2012 - I predict that Meisa Kuroki and Nami Tamaki will be doing some great things in the realms of Japanese electronic/techno-dance music.",1

"Good stuff from local Christian rock band Saw Harlend a couple years ago in concert 3 times and boy do they rock! I bought their first CD, an EP at one of the shows and it was great; I eagerly anticipated a full length album which this is. Some of the guys are from another local band I also saw numerous times and disbanded for whatever reason and then formed Harlend. They certainly know what they're doing.

From the bands Website: Keep You not only offers the desired catchy melodies and strong hooks you can find in other popular music, but more importantly it presents a challenge to its listeners. It is a call to action, a call to love, and cry for revival. With massive guitars, pounding drums, thought-provoking lyrics, and gut-wrenching vocals, Harlend is a welcome addition to any iTunes playlist.

Personally I feel the album doesn't break any new ground but treads the same Christian rock ground as many of their contemporaries with passion, gusto, and conviction. I highly recommend Keep You.",1

"Great debut album This folk-pop album is a pleasure to listen to. The songs have a genuine, heartfelt feeling, and the arrangements are clean and true, and, well, real. The upbeat ""And I'm Happy"" has an almost anthemic quality, while the ""Grandfather Song"" stirs up memories of loved ones lost or never found. After listening to the gentle, comforting second track, it's easy to believe that Everything Will, indeed, Be Just Fine. Long distance love is the topic of the pretty ballad ""Back to Minnesota"" and the foot tapping, rock-style ""Mile 77."" The youthful final track, ""Get it Right,"" reminds us of the ups and downs of new love. All in all, a terrific debut that makes me eager to hear what comes next from this talented newcomer.",1

When Frank (tenor Vale Rideout) sings ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"" in gospel style, accompanied by what sounds like a slightly out of tune piano (nice touch!), it's actually devastating.

Wilson Meadows I am a Wilson Meadows fan and enjoys anything he puts out.  This is a nice track to listen to.  Especially since it has been a while since he has released anything.,1
"Odd Music I own another track called Autumn Leaves by Coldcut which I absolutely love.  I thought this track would be
similar based on the very short music sample I got to hear on amazon.  Unfortunately the sample played only
the nicest part of the track and the rest was not my taste at all. The rest of the track was a day and night
difference from Autumn Leaves as well as from the sample portion of the track, so I found the sample very
misleading.  Good thing I paid only 99 for this track and didn't buy a whole CD with this kind of music.",0
Two Stars Not what I expected,0
"Looking Into the Sun, Great song writing & stellar playing! Thoroughly enjoy the songs, the lyrics, music & playing! It is very authentic, heartfelt & timely with great musicianship. Particularly love the harmonica playing & vocals. The songs are organic & the recordings sound warm & soulful.",1
"HIGHLY HYPNOTIC! Highly hypnotic tune. The recurrent bass line has been stuck in my head for a week...and with this tune, that's a good thing!",1
"Completley delightful! Rick Robinson heads this wonderful set of six musicians that make classical come out of its theater to the more accessible platforms for people to listen to and enjoy! Gitcha Groove on is a stupendous neo-classical composition that blends folk elements in its intricate notes. The violin,viola and cello renditions are marvelously in tandem and the talent of each of these performers gets a free rein of expression that delighted me completely :-) :-) :-)",1
You will love it first I heard this on Di. FM. I love the second half. It's a nice chill music (down tempo),1
"Nice album, but their live set will floor you... I recently saw Bailiff in concert (more on that later). Bailiff is a Chicago-based band led by singer-guitarist Josh Siegel, and their musical, while often labeled ""blues-rock"" certainly has blues elements but the music is much more than that. This is the band's second (and as of yet, most recent) album.

""Red Balloon"" (10 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with the short, introductory ""Crickets"", only to then dive in with ""In the Reverie"", an all-out rocker that reminds me of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, yes. ""Everyday Fire"" charges hard too, driven by a relentless bass. Side A concludes with ""Emptied Out"", a slowburner for sure but oh so good. On Side B opens with the title track, a slow, reflective tune that gives Bailiff and us the listener a brief breather. ""When I Leave You Will Stay"" is the most bluesy track on here. ""Overheard"" is the last highlight of this album. Bottom line: Side A rocks hard, and Side Be is more reflective but it makes for an overall great listening experience.

I recently saw Bailiff in concert at MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati. They played an early evening set. The trio's live sound is bigger and more massive than anything you hear on their studio output. I kept wondering how they were able to make the intricate wall of sound, at times prog-reminding music, with just those 3 instruments (guitar, bass, drums). If you have the chance to see Bailiff live, by all means do not miss them! ""Red Balloon"" is a nice album, but let's get some new studio material already!",1
I guess this artist is much like scotch. I guess this artist is much like scotch ... an acquired taste.  Don't be fooled by the reviews.  Really lackluster.,0

"Five Stars Very good, relaxing music.",1
"Feel-Good Modern Rock/Punk I'm always on the lookout for good guitar driven modern rock with clean vocals. It seems to be getting harder and harder to find these days, with so many bands turning to synthesizers, retro lo-fi garage band sounds, or emo screamy vocals. Sleeper Agent is good music though. Celebrasion has kind of a wild crazy, in-your-face party vibe going on, and it's super catchy and fun. Every song packs punch, with snappy beats and belting guitar rhythms.

I can't really think of any bands I can compare Sleeper Agent to. They have a bit of a modern indie sound with maybe a bit of punk, but it has a breezy, carefree quality to it that makes you move. The vocals remind me somewhat of Grouplove or Modest Mouse, which I think is part of what gives them that ""indie"" sound. But the music... Make no mistake, what you get here is straight up, no holds barred rock, and it's fantastic.",1
Two Stars don't know what i was thinking,0

"If you like Iron Maiden... This is the first Elixir album I have ever listened to, and being a huge Maiden fan, the experience so far is a positive one. The ""dueling axes"" here are pretty good, and the vocals are also good (but there's only one Bruce). If you like IM, or that type of metal you will probably enjoy this album.",1

not the orignial bought the original not the remix - its the one I like and I would give that one a 5 star rating! hope this helps.,0
Awful Doesn't do any justice to the original. It basically took all the fun out of the song. I don't understand why people are buying this?,0

"High-spirited, joyful, tuneful, spirit-lifting I always liked the Dodos, but never felt any great passion about them. But I think the passion in this song might be infectious. It could make me a bona-fide Dodos fan. This song starts off with a pounding heartbeat rhythm and proceeds with loose guitar and free-feeling vocals, soaring all over the place. The energy builds through the song, inciting involuntary head-bobbing and hip-swiveling. And it's even got a singalong chorus -- you know, if you can understand the words.  And if you can't, who cares?  You'll end up singing them anyway, 'cause that's the kind of song this is!",1
"Great for backround. I purchased this song because after watching the third Gundam Unicorn episode. This is the end music and I have had it stuck in my head since. I looked around for the artist and found the song and artist here. I like to listen to it while writing, great song!",1
One Star ver bad song ui hate,0
Amazon Came Through! I searched some years for this song. I checked every place on the Internet I could think of. And guess where I finally found it .... it Amazon. Incredible!

"original This is the whole band.  Some songs resemble their new stuff, but other songs are available that were preformed by lost members that have a very good and distinctive sound.  It is all accoustic, yet is, to me, one of their only complete albums.  The new albums, although great, seem like only half done.  This is truely a great album, and remains one of my favorate out of all the cd's I have.",1
"I LOVE this song........except for the ''Thank you Mohammed'' verse Oh Man......what a GREAT and uplifting song!! I also watch Mr. Anderson perform it live over and over on You Tube.

Really wish they would put out another album, this one is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums!  If you have seen their video you can tell they really perform well.  Who is the lady in the video????  LOL",1
"NOT the musical -- not even close I bought this knowing that it wouldn't be great, but I was going to see the musical and I like to have the music in my head before I see any musical. However, from the second the overture stated during the actual show, I realized that this was NOT the soundtrack, not even close. If you are the same as me, DO NOT buy this album, as it is not the musical soundtrack (even though the cover sort of matches the posters.)

It's like a bunch of people -- having no idea there was an ACTUAL Flashdance musical -- recorded a bunch of songs that they had lying around that thought might be in a musical. ""What a Feeling"" is there of course, as is ""Maniac"" (both of which are also in the musical). ""Gloria"" is not.  Then, they add a bunch of random ""80's"" songs, none of which have anything to do with the story. ""Fame"" -- ok, I guess. ""The Rose""... Hm... ""Maria"" from West Side Story... WTF?!? By the time that you hear ""Let The Sunshine In"" from Hair you realize that the producers of the album were tripping too hard during the 70's to notice the transition to the 80's.

Total waste of money-- this is an album of music that is kinda sorta not really inspired by the IDEA of a Flashdance musical. But not good inspiration -- the singing is third rate and the song selection is lousy. DO NOT BUY unless you really like these songs-- but listen to the previews first!

BTW -- There is an actual Flashdance Musical, and it is actually really good, and this album is really an insult to it. When THAT album comes out, I will totally buy it.",0

Five Stars Great song,1
Four Stars I just adored this.,1
"Too expensive I own the EMI set republished in 2011 of this record. Though I hear marvelling things about this recording, remastered especially for EMI Japan, the price of over 400 USD for a set is unreasonable!
Let's wait and see if the price will drop over the months. If NOT: I am affraid there will be almost NO buyers for this (wonderful!) record.

I owned a set of Gebhardt of this Ring: it was impossible to listen to the shrill and harsh sounds of that 'remastering'! I therefore have send it back to Amazon. So I stick on my version of EMI which is a very fine one. Despite so much critisim.. [I think I have a right say here, due to my music professional backgrounds].",0

"Beautiful I love this composer because of his rich melodies and moving themes.  This album is no different.  ""Eternal Ice"" was a song I heard on Youtube and I had to immediately get the entire album because of that one song.  That song is simply beautiful and moving all the way through.  I also love ""Welcome to Trollstad"" because it sounds like a battle theme from a video game!  It's simply superb!  ""Where I Belong"" and ""Gaelic Earth"" are both happy songs that I could listen to for hours.  I recommend this to everyone.  10/10!",1
"You won't be falling asleep listening to this. This CD entitled ""Music Therapy For Deep Sleep - Relaxing Nature Sounds and Music"" is produced by Super Audio PVT LTD in Chennai, India and performed by Joseph Vijay.  It is close to an hour long and is structured into six tracks of which five are about 10 minutes long and a single track (Track 3) is only about three and a half minutes long.

Ok, let me say upfront, this is only my opinion.  There are fans of every type of music...music I don't like, others will, and vice versa.  I don't like this CD.  I found it very uneven and, toward the end, impossible to relax to while listening.  The first track, Forest, is pretty good with a single piano composition.  There are bird sounds in the background but they are so soft that they fade away as the piano is playing.  The second track, Surf, is also pretty good.  The composition is played with a piano (or synthesizer?) with some electronic enhancement like reverb.  The surf is loud enough to fit well with the piano lead.  But by the third track, Storm, the CD begins to go off the rails.  The lead is a high pitched piano accompanied by strings.  The storm is essentially white noise in the background with an occasional wind gust that reminds my of a windy dry desert.  The fourth track, Thunder, is jarringly high pitched with strings, winds, and some piano interspersed with thunder.  The fifth track, Waterfall, brings back the piano/synthesizer? with reverb.  The waterfall sound is almost indistinguishable from white noise.  The score is played so slowly that the composition is just occasional high pitched random notes rather than a musical score.  The final track, jungle, brings back bird sounds and a high pitched piano with reverb.  The last four tracks are so jarring that they kept me awake rather than relaxed me.  This is not a CD for sleeping.  It tries for a drifting New Age vibe but completely misses the mark.  The integration of nature and music is poor and the track scores are more annoying than relaxing.  You won't be falling asleep listening to this.",0
"One Star Love the song, but I can't to a playlist and it does not show in my recent purchases!!!",0
They're coming to take me away song This is a awesome song it came out when I was young. Nice to hear a wacky song from the past,1
"Mouthbreather, my favourite Richmond band! Catchy little song. I believe Mouthbreather finally reached a new high with this two song EP, then they split. Their maturity as a band pours out in these two songs, while keeping that classic sound they are known for. Plus, I think they mastered the two singer schtick. If you have never heard this band you should check them out, well worth your time if you like a harder punk/alternative.

Reminds me of the Pop-Electronic tracks of The Pet Shop Boys in the 1980's.  It is hard to find this kind of thoughtful layered track production with catchy melodies and memorable lyrics in this day & age of throw-away ""Bieber-esqe"" & ""Iggy A-style"" Schlock Pop.  Keep it up, Monarchy!  I'm looking forward to their next release. :-)",1
"Great sound Found these guys from the Phoenix Alive song being on the FIFA 12 soundtrack. Looked up this album on spotify and wow! I'd compare their sound to cut copy/m83 in that it's the resurging 80s sound with a stronger dance element. I'd say these guys have the best singer of the bands with a similar sound.

I know folks check reviews to look for best songs to listen/buy. It's tought to pick songs from this album though because it's very cohesive and doesn't have any throw away tracks. That said, Phoenix Alive and Love Get Out Of My Way are probably my favorites. I really encourage listening to the whole thing though because it's solid from start to end.

All in all a really strong debut that sets these guys up for a great future!",1

"Just not as satisfying This album carries the retro element of Rose Hill Drive's sound into the glam era.  Adding a member buries the low end with a faster, higher pitched tone.  The melodic vocals of the earlier work are replaced with the kind of spastic squawking David Bowie used for effect in the late 70s with none of the tuneful baseline singing he balanced that against.  Somebody young and hip must have convinced them it isn't cool to sing pretty or write songs longer than a movie trailer.  The young geniuses who blew bands like The Who and Van Halen off the stage and brought down the house at roots rock gigs like Wanee have decided to make an album for rich kids in skinny jeans.  The musicianship and songwriting is still in there but the overall tone of these songs matches the packaged indie rock you hear in commercials for smartphones.  We can hope it's a phase they'll grow out of.",0

It really sounds like she recorded it in her bedroom on Garage band, which is really endearing. I suspect she may have an agent or manager that wants to make her the next pop sensation. The smart thing to do would have her keep pumping stuff like this out - a shower of bubblegum stuck in the hair of millions. The cover art is horrible.",1

Suffice to say that we sing snippets from all of them at various times as something comes up which reminds of a situation which relates.

Guzzle guzzle guzzle, munch munch gobble gobble, chomp! for example, when something is tasty.

The Ferrets, the weasels, and the stoats! when we're in the pet shop.

""Alas, I die,"" and ""But it's in the story!"" when we're being dramatic and in no danger whatsoever.

"Awesome debut! Really great songwriting for someone just starting their career.

"Only one quartet This product number is only one quartet, Beethoven's Opus 59 No. 1.  This is a magnificent piece and one of the best performances.  However, the title ""Complete String Quartets of Ludwig von Beethoven"" implies that the purchaser is going to get 16 quartets, not just one.  What a disappointment!

As minor points, it is worth mentioning that the composer's name was Ludwig van Beethoven, not Ludwig von Beethoven, and that the Budapest String Quartet made three recordings of his complete string quartets, which are noticeably different.  The music lover will want to know which one this is.",0

What's wrong?  DISTORTION galore Jack.  I'm wondering if the digital track for ""Teach Me Tonight"" by Brenda Lee was somehow mastered using a scratched VINYL record as the source!??  I've purchased over 300 songs from Amazon, and this is only the second track to be problematic.  First problem track I purchased was an instrumental recording of ""The Big Country (Main Title)"" by The City of Prague Orchestra,  That recording sounds like the download somehow became a bit scrambled.

So, if only 2 out of 300 downloads are bad... well I guess that is a pretty good track record.  But AMAZON Q&A managers... please tell your technical people to double-check recordings before you permit them to be purchased!  And if your team recognizes that a recording has technical issues, at least INFORM the potential buyer before hand; that way, if they are willing to take it (flaws and all), so be it.  Thanks.",0

It's considered a worthy example by many as Paray has a strong following.  However, do NOT download from here as this recording is in Mono rather than stereo, and the quality is very poor.  I think it was ""remastered"" from a Mono LP.  Not worth even the lowest price, save your money and buy the CD of the same work, paired with the Franck Symphony!",0
"Sound is sub-part See my review of the MP3 release of the Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Same disappointment experienced in this release ... it's almost as if they merely digitized my old, very old, LP (or a 78 rpm).

"Vintage Psych-Rock For Modern Times Listening to ""Come To Mary"" is like taking a trip back to the summer of '69 and the psychedelic rock that was a part of it. I wouldn't be born for 2 more years, but I listen to a lot of Rock from that era. This song is reminiscent of harmonies of Jefferson Airplane, the delicacy of America and flashes of the intricate guitar work heard in the music of Grateful Dead. Take a look at the mystical sounding lyrics and I think you may get the idea:

""Come to Mary; she don't mind.
Come to Mary; she don't mind.
Because everybody gets to have their time,
come to Mary; she don't mind.

To everybody left behind,
to everybody left behind;
the world feels wicked,
but I'm feeling fine.
To everybody left behind...

I'm the one who cannot let go;
how I long to stand beside her golden glow.
Come to Mary; she don't mind...""

Jesse Sykes & The Sweet Hereafter do a good job of recreating this impression of yesteryear, yet it sounds genuine and not an affectation. The song is pleasant and I'm glad for the chance to add it to the playlist on my Cloud Player. It isn't what I would consider a hit, but it has a genuine appeal. The 60s vibe is carried on through the rest of their 'Marble Son' album, so if ""Come To Mary"" whets your appetite, the perhaps it is worth dining upon the full meal.

"Digital version disappoints I LOVE this composition.  I have the original release of the LP.  I listened to it so many times alone (and with my children when they were young) that the LP became dusty, hissy flawed.  I did a digital transfer of my own from the LP to CD.  I really thought this MP3 would clean up the sound I got from my old LP.  NO SUCH LUCK!

I bought this version because it's the one I've always known.  But, there are MANY other recordings of this same work.  Shop around!",0

But this one doesn't even begin to compare. The hypnotherapists voice seems cool and disinterested. Some of the music was okay but there were moments where the background music reminded me of the music they play in movies right before or during the big action scenes--I immediately tensed up.

I didn't relax even once during the entire album and relaxation is the key component that makes any hypnosis work. I don't see how the suggestions for determination, motivation, willpower and fighting procrastination will work when I can't even relax when I'm hearing them. With the ""Fast Technique for Stress Relief"" I fell into a deeply relaxed state almost from the very beginning and felt relaxed through all the suggestions.

There are better hypnosis albums out there.",0

"Biggs' performance of Bach BWV 552 Biggs' 1964 recording of the E-flat Prelude and Fugue which is presented here poses many problems.  His use of overdotting in the ""homophonic"" sections of the prelude and taking those recurring sections in a different tempo from the more overtly ""contrapuntal"" sections is both misleading and a misconception.  In the forte and piano alternating motifs near the beginning of the prelude, Biggs renders the three sixteenth notes leading into it as an eighth and two sixteenths, adopting an absurd ""seufzer""-type two-note phrasing in his inimitable ""touch and go"" style of mostly sempre staccato playing, as Melville Smith long ago characterized it.

The fugue---really three fugues, each built upon the other and the last two being double fugues (the second is for the hands only)---suffers from Biggs' obliviousness to phrasing: the main subject, coincidentally resembling William Croft's hymn tune ""St. Anne"" (it is doubtful if Bach knew this tune, which made its initial appearance some thirty-one years before this fugue was written), is broken up at (if memory serves) an upward leap of a fourth between B-flat and E-flat.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about this playing is that it's accurate.  Biggs was fifty-eight years old at the time he made this recording, and the master tape was probably engineered by EPB himself (as were most of his recordings in what is now Adolphus Busch Hall). He was in the throes of rheumatoid arthritis, and often in the flesh was not capable of delivering the kind of performance you hear on this record.  The style of the first fugue (for five voices) always struck me as reminiscent of that of old choral motets, and there are many opportunities for approximating a choral sound on the organ in this piece----mostly a clean legato, opportunities for ""stretching"" (i.e., tempo rubato) and so on.  You will not hear any of this from Mr. Biggs.

The second fugue (manuals only, and challenging for even a seasoned player---if you want the piece to come across with the sense of voice-leading it deserves)---is chopped up and musical lines can only be extrapolated.  The last fugue is just notes.

I should point out that Mr. Biggs made another recording of BWV 552 (in stereo) a few years earlier, on the much larger Schnitger organ at Zwolle, The Netherlands, restored by Flentrop.  It is still wanting, but he took the prelude at a single tempo in that version and (as I remember---I have not heard that record in over forty years) took an expansive approach to the work.  I have not heard Mr. Biggs' earlier recordings of this prelude and fugue (mono era)---but those would be interesting comparisons.

In his own liner notes, Biggs credits the coupling of the Prelude and the Fugue (which respectively open and close the third part of JSB's ""Clavieruebung"", often called the ""Lutheran Organ Mass"") to Felix Mendelssohn.  Maybe.  It was Friedrich Griepenkerl, the first editor of the Peters edition of J.S. Bach's complete organ works, who presented them that way in the third volume of that edition, and made the coupling stick.

E. Power Biggs, for all his faults, was a unique figure in the history of organ performance.  He had guts, drive and imagination, and essentially created his own position.  He came to New York jobless and conspicuously lacking in funds, initially hoping to land a church position.  He contacted T. Tertius Noble, then music director at St. Thomas' Church in NYC, who found him an Episcopal job in Newport, R.I.  Biggs was eventually fired from that job --- it was assumed that, since he was an Englishman, he knew something about training boy choristers (he didn't) and became disillusioned with the church.  Barbara Owen tells that story in her book ""E. Power Biggs, Concert Organist"".  Biggs took another church job in Cambridge, Mass., which remained his permanent home until he died.  He held that church job until the late 1950s, but rarely played services.  He started an ambitious series of recitals, and persuaded the curator of the Bush-Reisinger Museum at Harvard to install an experimental ""neoclassical"" organ built by Aeolian-Skinner in what was then called the Romanesque Hall. He initiated a series of live radio broadcasts from that hall.  Twenty-one years later, this instrument was replaced by the Flentrop heard in the recording under discussion here.  Sadly, the year 1958---which saw the installation of the famous Flentrop, a marvel of an expanded chamber organ---also saw the cancellation of the radio broadcasts and the onset of Biggs' arthritis, which he fought, as best he knew how, for the rest of his life.",0

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): NeverWhas - Solid Will Into Sacrifice (Independent)
A four-piece from Illinois, comprising three brothers and their buddy, NeverWhas are young, hungry and talented. Their music is tough, modern rock, which nods respectfully in the direction of bands like Metallica, Muse and Maiden, though they're instinctively carving out their own sound. Singer-guitarist Mike is in possession of a distinctive growl, the sort of rumble that raises the hairs on the back of the neck, on rock fans and wolverines alike, and guitarist Nik drops solos like glass confetti.

Considering their independent status ""Solid Will Into Sacrifice"" has a vast sound. It's epic and glorious, and no more so than on the title track, which is complex, grand, progressive and systematically heavy. It's an outstanding six minutes and deserves to propel them into major venues. Other tracks are almost as good. ""Listen Closely"" is high energy and aggressively succinct and ""All Tech-no-logic"" releases their inner Sabbath before mutating into something altogether more vital.

If any of the above is of interest, don't hesitate in tracking these guys down. Recommended.",1

"Music is too loud I wanted to buy the meditation album to go with the ""Spirit Junkie"" book as an add on to my current meditation practice but have found through listening to the sample tracks that the music is too loud and I can't hear Gabby's voice with the guidance. Even with volume at maximum I couldn't hear her and I can't have the volume too high because I have menierre's ear and loud noise and music are two of my vertigo triggers. This and her other meditation cd's would be perfect if the music wasn't so loud or her voice so soft.

I think a reproducing to lower the music volume would make these meditation cd's perfect for her books and for those who never really meditated before.",0
"Funky eclectic song with awesome beat I'm 57 years old and never hear this song before the other day.  It is eclectically funky and a really fun song with a killer beat.  Probably not for everyone, but I really love it.  I have an older model convertible and nothing's better than driving down the road, top down and Funky Cold Medina blasting on the radio!",1
"like ""Wild Thing This song, like ""Wild Thing,"" has not aged well. Loc sounds smirky, his beats are no longer compelling, and his lyrics are full of juveline misogyny and transphobia.",0
Five Stars Great music from the day,1
Five Stars lovely,1
"Symphonic Ecstasy! Dark, lush and almost creepy orchestration mark this latest effort by the Finnish band Tears of Magdalena. Capably sung by soprano Magdalena Lee, this single has a very distinctive dark gothic sound punctuated by Lee's phenomenally gorgeous vocals and very high quality production values. If this song is any indication of what is yet to come from Tears of Magdalena, then listeners of gothic melodic/symphonic metal are in for a real treat.

Don't expect the heavy metal elements found in their previous efforts or the male ""cookie monster"" death growling so common to their first album ""Myths and Legends"".  This song is just four minutes of clean symphonic bliss.  The band has recently restructured and added a multi-talented new singer/keyboardist/bassist/guitarist in addition to Lee and vocalist/song writer Vasstago Archipelagus.  A new album is reportedly in the works so rest assured that some great things are yet to come from this incredibly talented band.",1
"Highly reccomend. Very professionally done.  This is a great CD, love it. Would definitely recommend it.  This is a must have for your collection.",1

"con job You buy this album and its almost identical in length to the samples given.  There are no complete shows. most are about 30 seconds and end abruptly, even in the middle of sentence or music. I had asked Amazon for ""old Radio shows"" and got these two albums.  This was deceitful and I am ashamed of myself being suckered so easily.",0
Not as good as the original! For anyone who has ever heard the original version it is a duet with wonderful harmonies. The remake of this song is missing the mark completely. With not allowing the proper duet with the original male singer. The harmony of these women is so off as some of the people singing this song are missing from the remake. In my opinion it doesn't sound correct anymore. Allure should have left well enough alone.,0
"I'm very disappointed. I didn't like this song at all because this song doesn't sound like the artist. It's not even the right version. I'm not very happy with this at all. The saying goes, you get what you pay for.",0
"Pirated rip-off of the TOM LP - don't buy! This compilation was obviously ripped off from the TOM (The Old Masters) LP produced back in the 1970s. (The LP itself was a bootleg of old 78s, but that's beside the point). The TOM LP's muffled sound, off-speed transfers, and inexplicable fade-ins have been reproduced here. Save your money and avoid this shady ""Hallmark"" release. Look for the CDs of Coon-Sanders on the modern-day TOM label. They have restored the complete output of the Coon-Sanders band in generally excellent quality and any one of those discs will give you much more ""bang-for-your buck"" than this rip-off download.",0
One Star It is a CD of samples...My fault I wanted the songs and not a sample of them.,0
Five Stars One of my favorite Solos by Dorinda Clark-Cole,1
"I Jumped In....And I Don't Want To Get Out! This album is nothing short of a 10/10 rating & here's why: It's musically diverse and the musicianship of Josh Lewis is played very tightly with excellent vocals yet at the same time has rawness which is everything a rock album should strive to be!

Josh Lewis needs to be given credit for a great and inspiring musical delivery overall; each instrument is highly involved in making these songs very much alive and kicking.
This is a very consistent effort with the fitting Rock N' Roll attitude written all over it.

This album rocks and will be timeless, each day I listen to ""Jumpin' In"" it still sounds fresh to me!....If this album were released commercially it would be a platinum seller!",1
One Star rip off,0
"One of my fab albums I fell in love with this band when my friend showed me their music about two years ago, since then I've seen them in concert acouple times. Their music speaks to anyone who looks for a little more than just a space cadet experience.",1
"Enjoyed This Project! The production of At The Hillside took 8 months to record in a Sunday school classroom in South San Francisco, California. When the CD was released, the proceeds from the sales were funded to countries that needed financial aid for hunger, weather disasters and building projects. I'm a customer at Amazon and was honored to learn Eldridge Books is offering At The Hillside. There is still a limited quantity of this CD and hope you will consider purchasing a copy for your enjoyment.

Thank you, Eldridge Books, and wish you much prosperity in 2012!

"Mal and Ed Blackwell Shine In This Trio I consider this one of the great finds of my more than 50 years of  record collecting.  I picked it up in a $1 clearance bin in Asheville North Carolina.  I have owned another recording by Mal Waldron, the 1986 Village Vanguard group with the great Woody Shaw and Charlie Rouse.  Although many consider this Village Vanguard session to be a classic, I found it boring.  So I was skeptical of this recording. Now, I treasure it.
It was recorded in Japan in 1983.
Mal has an unusual piano style, quite unique.  I won't attempt to describe it, but suffice it to say it has elements of Monk, and many other pianists.  Mal's music can be brooding.  The final cut on this CD ""Waltz For My Mother"" falls under the emotion of brooding, and is a lovely performance.
And drummer Ed Blackwell also has an unusual style.  He has taken what I call an old fashioned New Orleans drumming style and turned it to a style suitable to play in the legendary early recordings of Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman and Don Cherry.  Go figure!  If you can explain how a Baby Dodds New Orleans style of drumming lends itself to the avant-garde, let me know.  At any rate, it works.  Ed's bouncing, elegant rhythm fits in perfectly with Mal's deliberate, searching note choices.
I don't mean to neglect bassist Reggie Johnson.  He contributes fine accompianment, as well as good plucked and bowed solos.
This CD is a swinging, but controlled interpretation of jazz standards such as ""Bag's Groove,"" ""Billie's Bounce,"" and ""Round Midnight.""  There is great beauty contained herein.  These are mature artists playing at their best.",1
Not a fan When I purchased it through the app on my phone you really couldn't tell it was not by the original artist. I could only hear part of the song and assumed it was the same one. Nope. What a letdown.,0
"Artist receives no royalties from this album. This is Billy Vera.  Although this is a pretty good album of mine, from 1976, I receive no royalties, either as the singer or songwriter from it.

Sincerely,
Billy Vera",0
"Great free audio stories! These stories were a nice way to introduce my children to some audiobooks.

I was disappointed. In my yoga class each week the teacher plays the gong during meditation and it is completely transforming.  So I wanted to have this experience at home.  The sound quality of this CD is not nearly as good as what I experience in person.  It is not the person playing the gong.  It seems to be the technology used to record it.  I had expected it to be acoustically superior but it sounded as if it had been recorded with poor sound equipment.  I have listened to this once and don't think I would listen to it again.,0
"A Staple of Low Comedy Wagner was the George Lucas of his day, cribbing bits and pieces of authentic legends into a confused mish-mash of, in his case, fantasy opera, as Lucas later did in space opera.  Wagner was the apotheosis of the Central European late-Romantic tradition's devolution into pure bombastic excess.  As music could not develop further in this direction, in the 20th Century composers turned their backs on Wagner's overblown emptiness, freeing themselves to explore serialism, atonality, minimalism, ambient sound, and other previously unthinkable techniques.

The ""Ring"" cycle has since become a staple of low comedy, with the large, screaming blonde women in horned helmets, and the expression ""it ain't over until the fat lady sings"" (what impatient spectators were told while sitting through interminable ""Ring"" performances).  In ""What is Art,"" Tolstoy gives an outstanding review of an early ""Ring"" production that may be the funniest piece he ever wrote.  His insight is remarkable - it's easy to make fun of Wagner today, but at the time Tolstoy saw it, the ""Ring"" was considered to be the highest art imaginable.  My idea of the ideal ""Ring"" would have all of the characters dressed as clowns, with Larry David as Seigfried, Rosie O'Donnell as Brnnhilde (lip-syching to vocals by Yoko Ono), and Justin Bieber as Alberich.  There should be plenty of pie throwing, banana peels, and eye poking  la The Three Stooges.  With the special effects available today, it should also be possible to show someone skiing through a chain-link fence and turning into a pile of ice cubes on the other side.

Suffering through the marathon of an entire ""Ring"" performance can be of value only to specialists in the history of music or obsessed completists.  Castorf's recent production at Bayreuth in honor of Wagner's 200th birthday was roundly booed by the audience.",0
"What Happened to this Supposed Super Star It has now been 15 months since the release of the ""This Time"" single that was supposed to be the preview to a full Album release. The single was good and a change from her ballad diva style on AI.

Since then we have had another full season of American Idol, X-Factor, The Voice and Duets and are currently in the 2nd Seasons of X-Factor and The Voice but not a peep from Pia, not even a second single to whet the appetite.

Her day has gone and I can only assume there is some tension between her and her record company because so long without a debut album is too long by far.

Great potential but a very disappointing let down!",0
"Well? 6 months since first single, still no CD for us grown ups. They are marketing her to teenie boppers who listen to Disney rock music on their cell phones. That's not who voted for her on Idol. Boppers voted her OUT in a shocking upset, remember? Not enough 40 somethings to defend her, but that's who likes her! She is too grown up, pretty and threatening to tweenies. Her producers have no clue how to market her talent. They think real music is dead only because nobody can do it anymore. Her popularity was from adults starving for authentic singer who can emote adult feelings. She is not Gaga or Clarkson. Her voice is much stronger now from a year of working, so she sometimes oversings with shrill vibrato on the recent live performances I've seen on ""So Random!"" and the NASCAR 2011 finale's National Anthem. But she's still great!! Hopefully she will last until her ripoff Idol contract is over so she can sing some real music for us grownups.",0

"Disapointing Oh my....how to rate this

First, some perspective:  I love Gilda. One of my favorite movies. I love the movies various renditions of Blame It on Mame, even though rumour has it that is was not actually Rita Hayworth singing.

That said, this version of Blame it on Mame IS the actual solo guitar rendition from the movie...including Glen Fords lead in monologue. It was cut directly from the movie and is NOT a stand alone complete title. As such, it is very disapointing.

Honestly, I could have just recorded it from the movie myself, and I would have done a better job clipping and cleaning it up.

I suspect (though Im not going to bother checking) that the movie and songs are public domain, and that whoever recorded the song, edited it and converted to MP3 saw a way to make a fast buck

So 5 stars for the song, -3 stars for a direct movie rip (and rip off)

Recomendation: Skip it. You may as well rip it from the movie yourself",0

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Greenrose Faire - Neverending Journey (Independent)
Greenrose Faire is a six-piece medieval folk-rock band from Finland. I imagine live they're an absolute blast, and go down a storm at medieval fairs, and suchlike, but ""Neverending Journey"", their debut long-player, is worthy of attention in its own right. Their jaunty playing, Tomi Hyttinen's songs and Salla Rimmi's classic folk vocals come together to form something that falls between Steeleye Span's finer moments and the hugely enjoyable Circulus. The fact that their record sleeve brings to mind the minstrels in Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" just adds to the kudos.

Unusually for this sort of project, they neither pander to metal fans or proggers. Instead they stick to their own vision of five hundred year old song and dance music, with the latter desire to get an audience moving, an important factor. It's rare that I come across so many instruments that I don't know. These include a dadgad guitar, mandocello, Irish bouzouki and ifteli. If their desire was to worry my spellchecker, they've succeeded on several counts.

There are a number of tracks on ""Neverending Journey"" that I find myself returning to with some frequency. The opening call to arms of ""Dance 'Til Morning Light"" seems to function in the same way as Fairport's ""Come All Ye"" on ""Liege And Lief"". ""Beggars And Thieves"" has all the energy of The Levellers at their most strident (I am, of course referring to the crusty folk-rock band rather than the 17th century English radicals), and not forgetting ""Witchdance"", another floorshaker, and not unlike All About Eve - but considerably more fun.",1

"Not Really Rita I've read several biographies of Rita Hayworth that make a point of the fact that she was never allowed to sing her own songs. Even Robert Osborne on TCM made that point in his intro to one of her movies. The only information I can find on who might have dubbed in the actual singing is from her obituary published in the New York Times, which credited Anita Ellis for the singing in four of her movies (but only listed ""Pal Joey"" and ""The Loves of Carmen""). It's a bit of a disappointment. I love Rita's singing in the movies and the songs in this collection, but how can they pawn this off as a Rita Hayworth collection if it's not her doing the singing?

However, I purchased several of the songs in this collection anyway because I enjoyed Rita's performance in the associated movie. When I listen to them, I see Rita in the relevant scene from the movie.

So the bottom line is: go ahead and enjoy the songs but remember that it is not Rita Hayworth doing the actual singing.",1

I gave it one star only so I could write this review, but it deserves to have no stars at all, a waste of my dollar.",0

"Discovery of a very special singer Yolanda Rabun understands this song so well. She performs it with great skill and musicality and deep feeling. But it's also sexy and fun. Her musicians compliment her style with their own spare, jazzy, tasteful riffs. I look forward to hearing the rest of the album--and much more of Yolanda Rabun",1
"Not very relevant today. It is, to put it mildly, a ""dated"" collection of mostly-secular songs which would be unfamiliar to anyone now. Richard Ellsasser was a brilliant organist, with a massive repertoire, so I bought this recording just to hear what he did with the few marches one would still play today. It's not *that* interesting! The organ isn't identified here, and for that matter, most of the composers aren't identified, either. Ellsasser recorded mostly on the large but quite peculiar organ of the John Hays Hammond Museum at Gloucester, Massachusetts. It had the resources to play pretty much anything, but ultimately isn't a very good organ. If you're curious about what was clearly a commercial recording - Ellsasser playing on a recording meant to be a money-maker, rather than anything of artistic merit, ,go for it. Otherwise, I really would skip it.",0

"The First Ten Years Box From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The First Ten YearsThe First Ten Years is a series of 10 cds and double 12"" singles by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released between February 24 and April 28, 1990, to commemorate Iron Maiden's first ten years of releasing singles.

Each cd/double 12"" contains two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the b-sides. In addition, each contained a bonus track, a part in the ""Listen With Nicko"" series, in which drummer Nicko McBrain tells about the songs on the discs, in his own humorous way. Each part in the series included a special voucher. Ten vouchers could be exchanged by mail order for a limited edition box in which to store the CDs or records. Although the individual cds and vinyls are nowadays still fairly easy to come by, the boxes are a bit harder to find.

Just another peice of rare Maiden product for the true fan or collector!",1

"Amazon MP3 downloads Once again, Amazon sometimes gives me an MP3 file when I buy an MP3 song, and sometimes gives an AMZ file. I have sent emails and made a phone call and still cannot seem to get them to give me this song in an MP3, which is what they advertised. The MP3 help dept. is of no use. Their answer amounts to ""sorry, try again"". They always have you pay first, then find out you can't use the file. Their downloader caused problems on my machine, so I uninstalled it. There is really no need for their MP3 downloader or their Software downloader. Your browser will work just fine. As mentioned, I get MP3's just fine without their downloader, whenever they choose to send me MP3's.

To date, I have paid for this song, tried 3 times to get it, and still don't have it. I have asked if they could tell me in advance of paying which songs will be MP3's and which will be AMZ's. They act as if I never asked and tell me to download it again. I am putting this here because they don't listen when I email or call.

Amazon is over all a great company, but their software and mp3 download operations are being run by the wrong people.",0

"she need you to be a lowlife and she needs to keep you low by scripting insincere songs that are of a pathetic melancholy demean Skyler Gray is a shame because Skyler Gray never lived a life where she was ever really invisible, because she was always getting praise for acting off of the script; where she frauds human expression, because acting off of his script is an act. She is not singing - she imitates. Most people lack allot of character, and Skyler Gray depends on you being inferior.. Yeah, because if you can entertain yourself - you will not idolize her. Yep, she needs you to be a lowlife, and she needs to keep distracted from developing the character to be able to entertain yourself; by scripting insincere acts, toying with (fans have given me admissions and confessions) envy/lust, keeping you low and or in the past with scripts that are a pathetic melancholy demeanor, or imitator actor using a phony sex appeal image. Skyler Gray scripted words that were never meant to be delivered in the form of a song format. Why is she imitating singing then...? Go do it! Go script words and act (imitate singing) of the script - you're acting and projecting a fraudulent and insincere form of a message and singing expression. Why, other than to get and that mainstream dream seat, because sing/rap imitation enables national attention and feeds the approval problem. Skyler Gray is certainly not the type of woman to be a leader, as far as somebody who is lived much pain and suffering being in isolation, against their will, and being invisible to the world, because girls like Skyler Gray keep real woman and real singer/rapper unheard and buried. Even worse, the lyrics that she scripted, the insincerity; just exposes how vain and selfish she really is, because it describes somebody who will never be happy, until she's able to be a phony image on a cover, and projected to the entire world.",0
"Lovely As someone who struggles with an invisible chronic illness (and has for 7 years) this song is very relatable to me. It also has lovely music though, and is beautiful all on its own. Originally found it through a support website and am glad I did.",1
Why? so many kids out there are confused and trying to find themselves - the song is an anthem to depression and self destructive behavior. These types of songs do not guide a young mind to grow and choose a better path. Instead they're sadistic and unnecessary - I really hate when my 10 year-old tells me this is a favorite song she hears on the radio - and it's ubiquitous - there are few stations a young person won't hear it. Can't get my daughter interested in NPR yet.,0
"Not good. I got these remix ones of Lady Gaga for Poker Face, this, and Bad Romance.  Believe me I'm not picky, but they aren't very good - whoever does these did bad.  When Madonna remixed her songs, they do a better job.

I ended up giving it away to a neighborhood kid who seems to like.",0
"Bootlegs are Better How is it that all of the official remixes of a song this huge have turned out to be useless compared to the original?  I do really like the Bassnectar remix...but for a dancefloor, none of these remixes on either of the releases make the song any more fun than the original did.  Most disappointing batch of remixes I have seen in a long time.  Most of them start cold and allow no room for a layered mix.",0

"Tunnel Focus This selection of isochronic tones combined with the ambience sort of brings about a mild ""tunnel focus"" that helps you analyze and complete what you need to do.

Let me just politely say that if you went to the Renn Faire or Pennsic and were blown away, and something deep within your soul craves more Tartanic like mine did, this is not the CD you want.

I'm sure there are some people somewhere who really like ""UnFaire"", maybe some European disco types or something. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not my cup of mead. I know, I know, this is art, and artists need to be free to go where their artistic expression takes them, and who am I to judge. But really guys? I guess I should have been tipped off by the name, but then again I probably am as stupid as I look. Nine dollars worth of stupid.

"one of my favorites I love these songs. I have varying levels of insomnia (depending on the day and my anxiety level) and struggle to get to sleep as well as stay asleep, to make things worse, medication only seems to work for me for about a week before my body grows accustomed to it and the medication stops working. My therapist introduced me to meditation and, after I commented on how well it worked during our sessions, suggested that I try it before bed to help clear my mind. These work great for this. I especially like the ones with the birds and/or wind sounds, it's so peaceful and not obnoxious like some of the others I've heard with excess sounds. They help me visualize that I'm in a field or something in the middle of nowhere. One thing to keep in mind; this is a compilation and I found that I already have some of the songs on the full album, so I would suggest going through the samples and checking that you don't already have some of the songs.",1

"Roots returning? This album combines some delightful (and early? pre-D or AUM?) tracks mingled with some of what we later hear on the blissitudinous CELEBRATION, from 1976, done while Deuter was in Poona or almost there, I think. The good thing about these loving, meditative tunes is that it sounds like they're of higher mastering quality than the dull CD of CELEBRATION which is all we've had for years. The entire Deuter catalog to 1985 should be remastered, but who has the money... Alas!",1

"anything but classic This musical title is anything but Classic or Egyptian.  It's downright wierd.  I've listened to a lot of classical Arabic music, particularly  Egyptian music, both modern and golden-era.  I'm also familiar with a lot of fusion music.  This CD is different from all of those.  There is singing in English, with lyrics that are frankly a little dumb and almost Orientalist-sounding.  I just can't imagine myself ever using this music for performing and some of it makes me cringe.

I can't believe this CD was made by the same fabulous musician (Dr. Samy Farag) who produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Magic-Belly-Dance-Music/dp/B000065EON/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Magic - Belly Dance Music</a>",0

However, The Grand Floridian Society Orchestra's second album ""Puttin' On The Ritz"" packs in old time classics with as much charm and hidden treasures as the spectacular hotel itself. Featuring about 45 minutes of nearly forgotten hits of the 20s and 30s, the album misses the familiarity of the band's first release but repents itself with lush sound and soothing vocals; an odd solo in ""Boo Hoo"", however, is a tad off-putting, but doesn't scrape this otherwise grand album!",1
"Wow! Let me 1st just say this....The fact that these guys aren't signed to a major label or at the least touring the world is flat out crime.

The Bastard Suns are one of those bands that putting any label on them is just not going to do them justice.  To describe there sound I'd say at their heart it's punk.  Heavily influenced by Rancid, Bad Religion, Sublime, House of Pain, & some Rockabilly Soul.  The band is amazingly tight, the drummer is just incredible, & the singers voice.....what can I say.....it's phenomenal!  There's no strain to it or falsetto, it's like Jameson Whiskey, smooth & harsh at the same time.

Their originals are great, fun, pub songs, and the covers they choose suit them perfectly.  And in case you haven't listened to other EP's the song selections suit the Season they were written for perfectly! These EP's are an incredibly original way to put out their music.  They allow their fans to get to know each song well enough to sing along to them & right when you start jonesing for more...POW!  A new one was released.

Buy all 4 of these EP's you won't regret it!",1

"MIislabled entirely Ok first of all I ordered my copy from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as Used- Like New.  I have ordered many many things with Amazon, but never have I received such a mis labelled mess as this.  First off the original packaging of the CD's was horribly damaged.  It was dented, scuffed, torn, bent and scratched.  Tape was added to hold the package together which had been advertised as Factory Sealed and there was a sticker on it which said Factory Inspected, which was covering a large amount of the damage.  The CD's appeared to be ok though and I needed them for a Project at the school I work at so I kept them.  When I played them I soon realized that the play lists were not even close to the ones in the listing.... The following is the correct  listing taken from the box.... additionally the cd's had no labeling on them at all so when  I had to transfer them to a holder I needed to  type up a list ... The factory packaging was large and unwieldy and the CDs were not very safely contained in their slips. They were very difficult to remove and even if the original package had been pristine I probably would not have kept them in it. The extra tape peeled off part of the label of one of my cds.  What I listened to sounded ok, but is nothing special.  There was no particular flow of the music and I am glad I purchased another CD which has a much better mix of tunes from the war years

"Really?  We are worth dying for? The Bible tells us something quite differently.  Sure God loves us but we are wicked by nature and are not worthy of his gift of eternal life.  We lie cheat, cheat and steal.  We fornicate, blaspheme and murder. That's worthy?  We deserve hell and it's only by his Grace that those who turn away from their sins and trust in Jesus as their savior will see that eternal life with him.

"Mission Excuted/Master Project Genesis Mission Executed is a speed/thrash album from Target, you can are hear a similar music style band's like vendetta,deathrow,iron angel,living death...German speed/thrash metal

Target does a very good jobb, they play fast and heavy from start to the end, with thrashy and melodic riifs and with some good solos.
The vocal is angry with some high screams here and there typical for this kind of music, but he does a excellent perfomance.

If you like speed/thrash metal from the 80's this is a winner

Target's second album is progressiv and has more technical sound than the debut. The prodction is much better here with a tick and clear sound.

I think there is a good blance between the thrash and the progressiv it all mix very good togheter, its  not to complex and you don't get lost.

The music is filled with good thrash and technical played. They have slowed it a little down, but some track's has also some good speed to it . They change their vocal and thats very sad because is he was very good, but i think the new vocal suits better to this kind of music, he has clearer voice and he sings very good.

The frst couple of lissen to this album i was not so impressed so much, it takes some time to really get into it, this is one of those albums that keep growing on you
Now its one of my favorite Thrash/speed/progrsiv album

I recommend this album from Traget to all metal fans.",1

Having seen them in concert and after listening to many of their live recordings, I found this album to be a bit of a disappointment.  But, that could be said about many of the bands in this genre.  Seeing them live and in person is the way to go, with listening to a ""live"" recording as the next best. As with most improvisational artists, studio recordings don't always measure how good a band is organ be.  There is something to be said about the symbiotic relationship between musicians and their fans at a concert that you can't quite grasp unless you experience it.",0

"A fan review... From the HOINH MySpace page (no, I didn't write this!)

What a mixed bag after a few listens to this album. HOINH is a large group, the new wave had some really important records in the past months and weeks. Not enough that these monstrous hits. Let's get in most songs, which you surely know.
It is the definition of the new wave of track and eighties-style, ""Hohohoinhho"". A scenario for a man makes her a star and is on her own. And she leaves him? The participation of the dialogue really captures you and the savvy mix of techno keyboards and catchy is legendary. ""This Is A Gun"" is a fairly optimistic number keypad with a touch of ska feeling, but without the horns. The things this group have keyboards, I'll tell ya. ""I Have A Real Feeling"" is a sensitive love song, and has continued in the direction of the new wave of brilliance, but this time R & B master HOINH a rift in the group. The production is a simple mixture of drum machines and light touch of ivory. A classic era of big hair and their second smash ( ""Space And Time Continuhoinh"" is their first). Their next hit here known to the obscure nature, but if you had an eye on MTV and VH1 for about a month or so in 2007, you have to hear this clubby record with a retro feel in ads for shows reality. ""Cyerscheisse"" is very much like ""N For Nerd,"" but the sound is of a Europe that effort updated dance, which is very plausible, but I do not know, it was could be a huge chart hit here.

They need to know and how these four songs, as I was, and am still, but looked at the rest of the series, and asked: ""Total Hoinh"". Well, the truth is revealed that in this sentence HOINH is really not that the industry is a band, but one of its New-Wave Experiment, worked a few times. The rest of the songs are mostly dark-sounding accounts of love. ""A Fluid In The Light"" trip to Motown ""Karma Chameleon"" (even if this does not come, first served). No one asked for, have they? Trippy request comes as a creepy in ""Banned Electro"" and ""ShakeASpear 4 Shakspeare."" These early efforts together with ""Das Falche Gebot"" are just terrible and dated. ""Banned Electro"" is so much talk here that you think it was a great political song, but it is so dry and pop, that it feels stale rocky.

The not big hits are not so bad, but a required taste, you do not expect here. The fun pop hits here, but are very important and very danceable. For the hits, you might want to be this sentence, but the aging of the eighties synth arrangements pull the album. Also, I know it's strange that I want, that imports, but I found it on a trip and had only musically something different from the United Kingdom. Maybe next time I should for something modern.",1
"Great CD! This is Volume 1 of the Sing it Down compilations to support SOA Watch. Great songs and powerful voices, Colleen and Jolie Christine make a great album!",1
Delightful songs dating back to the 40's I remember listening to many of he songs that are on this album when I was a single digit old.  Being able to hear Burl Ives once again sing them was a 5 star treat for me.,1
"You will like it I bought this because of the great trumpet music that is in sections of the song, I am seldom so impressed by trumpet music but this was very well done and really makes the song standout. I could not wait to get it so I downloaded the song rather than waiting for the CD to be sent, it makes a great ringtone for the phone. The whole CD is very good and you may want get all the music offered on it.",1

Both songs are lovely(although you're probably a bit tired of ""In The Sun"" if you are a She & Him junkie).

I could listen to this on repeat for hours and never get bored with it.",1
"not original, but not bad this cd is mediocre at the very best. the guitars are all muffled and sound the same most of the way though. drums are good tho. i don't like the way the singer yells. i saw buny live their better live than on this cd  thats fer sher. anywayz with all the ""hardcore"" bands coming out  theses dayz itz not easy to rise above and be original. their ok but they  sound just like all the rest for the most part. 1 star.",0
"Freakin Amazing! A bunch of my friends have this CD and now I finally got it. I can not stop listening to it, it is crazy! I think it is awesome how Buny is starting a new style of music called Death Groove. It will be cool once  they start blowing up spreading True Death Groove worldwide. If you are in  to heavy music that you can jump to then get this now! I love how they have  one singer that screams so insanely and one that sings and raps. My other  favorite bands are Slipknot, Coal Chamber, Korn, etc. Can't wait to see  these boys right up there with them. There is no better!

"This Is THAT Album! This album from top to bottom is a diverse mix of smooth melodies that provide a unique musical perspective about living in the faith. I think that the sequencing of the songs was on-point and allowed the listener to go through the ebb and flow of the walk that most Christians have. Christon's voice is as smooth as they come and he doesn't ""overdo"" it in any of the tracks. I feel that he is a great blend of what it takes to be a relevant musical voice in the Kingdom.

This is one of those albums where my ""favorite"" song can change day to day. The first song to lead me to this album long ago was ""Isle of You"", which was a title that caught me initially because of it's play on words (as a poet/write, I had to dig that). The song was so amazing to me that I do wish that I would've known about it before my wedding - definitely a wedding song! I have to also say, though, that the title track is one of repentance that I can feel every word of. I have so much love for the Fred Hammond original, ""Mender of Broken Hearts"", so much in fact that I would argue that the remake is just as high of quality as the original, which is certainly not always the case.

After listening to this for a couple of years, I now have gotten caught up with ""Gray's Conclusion"", which to me is just as transparent as the majority of the album, but is the right summation of who Gray is as an imperfect man, but his effort to be the best that he was created by the Father. Truly, it served as the reiteration of the album's title - almost a continuation of ""Even With Evil With Me"" in it's own way.

For those who appreciate musical tastes of Jazz, R&B, and just message with the right message, this album is the one to go with. Every project since has been of excellent quality. Keep your ears open for this man of God, because he has something important to share by way of his gift of music.",1
Five Stars beautiful,1

Very Good Album Such an amazing album with many good songs I highly recommend it to any fan of Strike Anywhere or just punk music in general alot of the songs also have good lyrics to back them up with messages which makes it that much better,1
"Strike Anywhere at their best Can't say a bad thing about Strike Anywhere or this cd. As a band, they are always thought provoking, fun, intense and overall consistent; you know what you are going to get when you pop in one of their cds and that's always a good thing. After a few years since their last cd, this one was a great return to form. I had high hopes for it and it delivered. It's a great cd that will appeal to new Strike Anywhere listeners, casual fans, die-hard fans and even people that may believe they aren't fans of this type of political fueled punk rock. Bottom line, you can't go wrong with this cd.",1
"Major Let Down I have to agree entirely with the earlier review by CallMeGod.  The vocalist induces listening fatigue after the third or fourth song due to his whiny nasal and basically boring vocal style.  He seems to have processed the main vocal with his own slightly de-tuned overdubbed back-up vocal )or applied some sort of effect - sounds a bit like Autotune to me), but the end result is essentially harsh, irritating and annoying.  Nothing smooth or 'groove' about it at all.  It could be that the vocal melody line is just too flat all around, and no vocalist could have saved these songs, but whatever the problem is, this CD is a total miss.",0
"A Shameful taste of things to come.. I'm going to have to break off from the other reviews written here.

I have been listening to John Brown's Body (JBB) for a couple of years now, a really big fan of their sound and performance ever since I saw them live.
From such older classics like ""Garden Tree"", ""Feel"" and even to more recent hits like ""Resonate"" and ""Picking Up."" These songs range from having funky dub, laid back reggae, and all around feel-good music.

Unfortunately I can't say the same for this latest release from the group.
""Amplify"" sounds like an all-to-familiar attempt for the band to go more mainstream to bring in more fans. It's almost as they're trying to hard, with songs like ""Amplify,"" with some joker rapper spitting verses towards the end of the song. A rapper? In Jbb? It sounds as bad as it seems.

On top of this much more mainstream and at some points boring melodies, they also adopt common and overdone vocal lines, evident in ""Push some air."" Just listen to the first verse, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
But not all the songs are complete garbage. The songs I did enjoy were coincidentally the ones that sounded way too similar to previous classics. This is where ""Sky Juice"", ""Give yourself over"", and ""Zion triad"" fit nicely.
The rest of the songs fit in the void of a combination of genres that just don't work. Examples are ""So Aware"", which is a failed take of JBB trying to make a love song for teenagers to croon to each other, with the overuse of string instruments. ""Be at peace"" sounds like it was created for a Disney movie like Little Mermaid, when our two heroes fall in love.

Bashing aside, I would not recommend this album to any JBB fans who enjoy their more classic sound. ""Amplify"" strays far from the path, infusing more mainstream and gimmick sounding genres.",0
"Amplify by JBB - Cutting Edge Dubby Electronica Fusion Roots For over a decade, the American band John Brown's Body has continued to refine and improve upon their authentic roots reggae sound with each of their previous five releases.  Their new CD `Amplify' contains diverse music that continues to direct this positive vibe in a fresh and exciting direction.  The 12 tracks on this release incorporate a myriad of influences ranging from toasting and psychadelia to dancehall, hip-hop and electronica. The instantly recognizable skank of reggae is still prominent throughout most of the tracks, but that usual format is altered, enhanced and cleverly rewoven into a unique sonic hybrid that almost defies categorization.

Elliot Martin, the bands lead singer and front man, possesses a distinctive voice that reveals itself in a multitude of vocalization techniques - powerful intonations and crisp, exact chatting can seamlessly flow into controlled intimacy or combine with his own splendid self-supporting back-up vocals.  His voice, blessed with a warm equalized tone, often is displayed utilizing controlled syllabic fluctuations which would make even the most confident verbalist jealous.  Mr. Martin is also the catalyst behind the well structured and conscious lyrics and he has shown increased confidence in his song craft that was evident on the 2002 release `Spirits All Around Us` and dominated on the excellent 2005 CD `Pressure Points.`

`Speak of the devil' is  a sinister effort built upon a one-drop riddim that warns the listener to be more aware and reconfirms that the righteous shall always prevail regardless of any forms of opposition.  Vaughn Benjamin of the group Midnite contributes a patois-intense vocal towards the end of the track, nicely complimenting the concrete solid dub rhythms.  `Skyjuice,' perhaps the most imposing track on the release, is resplendent with intricately dense horns and tremendous groove-heavy beats from the always impressive drummer Tommy Benedetti.  `Ghost Notes,' infused with a heavy established skanking riff not heard since the days of early Aswad at their finest hour, is a mid-tempo reflective piece that pays due respect to the band's former bass player Scott Palmer, who passed away a few years ago.  The lyrics are poignant and display an ardent compassion seldom found in contemporary song writing.  "" Gave with every note he played, we won't be forgetful. ""

While fundamentally faithful to the reggae vibe, John Browns Body creatively weaves rhythms and beats with layered instrumentation that provides a foundation for complex call and response vocals and splendid brass flourishes. The guitar work is tight and circulates amidst a variety of layered keyboard parts that act as a supportive framework throughout the songs.  Throughout the entire disc, innovative dub-friendly basslines enjoy enlightened interplay with crisp, bouncy drum beats.

The inclusion of exotic instrumentation such as the kora and violin take the galloping track `So Aware' outside the traditional reggae parameters to a subtle, worldly flavor echoing stylistic integrations used by North African Rai musicians.  Another contributing ingredient to the entire John Brown's Body sound are the exception production techniques that meticulously meld the surfeit of rhythms and beats with rich instrumentation, detailed harmonization and an enveloping use of atmosphere.  The editing is stellar and the expressive arrangements are complete with unexpected twists.  Live soundman and studio producer Jason `Jocko' Randall polishes the bands current creations enhancing the cross pollination of numerous musical rhythmic styles.  The result is a new style of music that possesses a vibe always loyal to the mystic, earthly tones of roots reggae while being inventive, groove-heavy and cool.

John Brown's Body have established themselves as perhaps America's most creative and dedicated reggae ensemble.  On `Amplify,' the latest incarnation of the band successfully executes a variety of moods that are ambitious and vibrantly experimental.  With the addition of new band members, Elliot Martin and Tommy Benedetti have embraced a new found sense of purpose and delivered a collection of compositions slightly ahead of its time. The music and lyrics demand that the listener's brain multitask to appreciate the sophisticated textures and depth of arrangements.  However you describe this music: groove music with reggae overtones or dubby electronica fusion roots, the final result is energetic, very original and ultimately impressive.",1

If you like Dr Who - Doctor/Donna - you will love this - if you liked ""Much ado about nothing"" you will love this.",1
"well, my kids like it ... My kids watch the show, and I often see it with them. I like the show - it's cute.

This song however ... eh. The chorus is kind of catchy, but the verses are blah musically and don't go anywhere.

The lyrics ... well, about as intelligent as any dance song. And could easily be interpreted to be racy (which I don't like, for my kids) but are just ambiguous enough to be deniable.",0
"Five Stars ahaha best, i don't know why i keep listening to this, but its very catchy song",1
One Star didn't like this version,0
"FALSE ADVERTISING When I typed ""Every Praise"" by Hezekiah Walker into my browser, this is what comes up. This IS NOT Hezekiah Walker!",0
"Love This Song! This is a great praise and worship song.  It's got a catchy tune, simple words, and compels the listener to sing along with a big smile.  Love it, love it, love it!",1
"Five Stars Outstanding ""Orphans"" as usual.",1
"Poor volume consistency As another reviewer pointed out, the volume is inconsistent. One song will be so quiet we can't hear it and the next is so loud that it wakes the baby. I haven't listened to all of the songs yet because the volume issue is so frustrating. I was very excited to find classical lullabies at such a great price, but this album is worthless to me.",0
"Rancho Relaxo ... No matter the volume, the music of Rancho Relaxo doesnt rise from your speakers, it ebbs and flows, like some thick sonic liquid, barely viscus, pushing and swirling its way into your room, hovering at floor level, then rising up the walls before spilling back down onto itself ... all the while you sit there, eyes glazed, afraid to move, afraid to break the trance, afraid to make any motion that would spur you from the delightful ether laden musical adventure.

This band who hale from Norway, have learned from the best, memorizing with Americana guitar jangles, eastern sitar influences, tambourine trances, and its all held in place by a mystic backbeat thats as primal as it is etherial ... instantly bringing to mind work done by The Beatles on Revolver, not to mention Brian Jonestown.  Yet they do it all without sounding beholding, or under the influence of anyone, delivering a sound thats as dark as night, and surely suitable for any out of body experience you could conjure.

My recommendations [?] ...
-If you don't have one, purchase an Oriental rug ...
-Candles, along with a Lava Lamp to light your way ...
-Heavy Victorian Curtains to block the sun ...
-And finally, a comfortable place to sit, where you can be absorbed by the music ...

Please ... send me a postcard when you get back, I love to hear about your trip.

Review by Jenell Kesler",1
"Beautiful Song This is just an amazing version of this song.  The original Offspring version is one of my favorite songs of theirs, and I like this version just as much if not better than the original.",1
"Great artist, great album. Great new artist, great new album. You won't regret this purchase. I love most of the songs on the album. I expect we'll be seeing a lot more of this artist in the future.",1
"best of 2011 if you want this album, (which you should because it's good) just buy top of the world and the halo nova song.
then you can buy the ""best of 2011"" album and get all the other songs in it plus 15 more for only like 2 more dollars!",1
If you like Evanescense this is better. More like We are the Fallen. Second best album I've heard in recent years only behind Tear Down the World by We are the Fallen.,1
"Not their best. If you liked VoB's album Le Funk the most, there is nothing for you here. If you liked Night On Fire, again, next to nothing for you. Bring on the Comets? The final track, Over - which doesn't fit in with the rest of the album's cold, calculated dance beats - may appeal to you. Overall there a a hand full of ok songs on this album (All Summer in A Day is pretty good), but it mostly just doesn't feel like a VHS or Beta album. Very, very few guitars. They've completely abandoned their full band sound in favor of a sound somewhere between a gutless version of the presets and a less smooth version of the junior boys. I consider VoB one of my favorite bands, but the road they've chosen to travel (while I respect their right to do so) is one I will not be following them down.",0
It's just okay. This album was alright.  I guess the first song was pretty good. After that I stopped paying attention.  These guys are no Foster the People.  Now that's some REAL music!,0
"Beautiful Music I heard this amazing lady sing in person last night.  She has a beautiful, clear voice - one you could listen to for hours.  The few songs I've heard from the album were excellent - I've no doubt the entire thing is fabulous.",1
"Really good singer, formerly of Tercer Acto Mexican prog rock,this is where it's happening folks. These guys have a mixture of Symphony X, Dream Theater ,and a mix of Old Kamelot. Really good singer,formerly of Tercer Acto. I could only obtain the MP3 version,but hope to get all their CDs,this will happen when I can travel into Mexico again. All musicians are good,no surplus musicians,gelled very well in a well oiled machine. I recommend if you are into the afore mentioned groups.",1
"Jimmy Sings it Best Do some research on this song, it is so beautiful, yet tragic also. This is one of my all-time favorites. God is the Great Lighthouse that brightly beams across the dark sea of humanity, and He guides them to the entrance of the harbor, yet WE are the keepers of the lesser lights on the shore that help guide lost souls in their final journey to safety, thus WE must keep our lights burning brightly lest they crash and break up on the rocks.",1
Five Stars Love this music.,1
One Star Disappointed,0
"Just buy the single. The single is good but the album as a whole was not very good. Wish I didn't buy it, feels like a waste of money.",0
"Sound quality is 1/3 good, 1/3 okay, and 1/3 lousy. Save your money and don't buy it. This set contains three CDs; the sound quality varies wildly among them. The second CD has good sound quality; nothing special, but good. The first CD has okay sound quality, although it sounds rather flat. The third CD, however, has abysmal sound quality; rather than ""recorded live"", it sounds as if someone recorded it with their cell phone during a concert and then made bootleg copies off that recording. Guevara's voice is often lost in the background; the piano is loud but the quality of the sound is bad; spoken words can barely be understood.  This is simply unacceptable in what is sold as a professionally produced CD. Save your money, and don't buy the set.",0
"Wrong Item I ordered this set expecting Dick Bartley. However, I got Dick Clark instead. It was a 6 CD set, but a completely different one than advertised.",0
"My Star is simply Magic It's hard to believe that it's going to be eight years since I walked into a Borders and first heard Marina. Like my favorite song, her latest CD My Star is Simple Magick. Within Marina's music you sense the strength, character and intensity, which come from her soulful sprit. Yet there is the vulnerability of a fragile soul there, that makes you want to enfold her in your arms and tell her everything will be fine. Marina's music will skillfully take you through the range of human emotions.

And she just keeps getting better and better. You won't be disappointed.",1
"Great and curious Well, if you're a The Police fan and you like to hear classic tunes on a new dimension don't loose the opportunity to hear that fantastic CD.",1

What's not to like about Queen Classics likeBohemian Rhapsody? Amazing song. Need I say more?,1
"Great American music McKay and Co have done a great job with this CD. It has lots of guitars and I find myself humming the songs after they've finished playing. Definitely worth buying, and I'm glad i bought the entire album instead of just a song or two. The singing can be a little hard to understand, but that hasn't stopped a lot of musicians. Great album, can't wait for more.

As for the ""explicit"" label, there is one word in one song. Jeez.",1
"Favorite Downtime Music I have no idea how authentically ""Arabic"" any of these songs are, and I don't really care, but this is by far my favorite downtime compilation of all time. If these were albums, I'd have worn them out.",1
"Perfect for both my kids Perfect for both my kids, 5 and 10 years old.  My kindergartener learned a lot about various presidents in preparation for Presidents' Day. My 10 yo already had a placemat with all the presidents. So there'd been a lot of talk and quizzing each other about presidents.  So I searched for a song to teach them the order, found several, but they both like hip-hop/rap, and even I (who usually does not) found this to be the catchiest tune out there!",1
"""My Favorite"" singer/songwriter I already own One Spark, but I bought the EP for the two songs that aren't on that album.  Definitely worth the purchase to get Things That Move Me and, especially, Change.  Gabe Dixon is the best singer/songwriter around these days. He makes the kind of music you can listen to for years!",1
One of Queen's Best Love Songs One of the most beautiful Queen love songs ever! Freddie Mercury's vocals are just amazing!!,1
"Beautiful songs, Beautiful Voice! No More Invitations is one of the best cds I have ever heard. Jennifer's voice is silky smooth and I love every song on there. I absolutely love ""Follows Me Still"" and ""Chapter You"" is amazing...such a folksy and warm sound to her voice that wraps around you like a warm blanket on a winter's night. I have to say my favorite (which was very hard to pick) is ""3000 Miles""... So soulful and really touched my heart. Thank you, Jennifer Haase, for sharing your wonderful talent.
I guarantee that if you buy this cd, it will immediately become your favorite...in fact, I would recommend buying 2, so you have an extra when you wear out the first one!",1
"VERY NICE RETRO 40's STYLE Wonderful arrangements on ""Jet Plane,"" ""Time After Time,"" and ""La Vie En Rose.""  To enjoy alone or with a few good friends!",1
"Life is short, buy it now. Despite the order in which I listen to them, the tracks on this album just get better and better. The only explanation I can offer is that this music is possessed. My own bone-headed skeleton argues otherwise though. Maybe a rusty shovel would knock some sense into him (?) Ric Bauer Kissimmee FL",1

Five Stars Great song by Pearcy. Sounds like a song that could have been on RATTS last album Infestation.,1
buy it.. badass country rap song alots of bass,1
"Country rap not bad. Unusual combination country/rap but it sounds good on the sub in the 4x4. It hits pretty hard.

"Don't Be Fooled By This Bootleg FYI: THIS IS A BOOTLEG!  _  There is an OFFICIAL ""Tales From the Darkside""; but it is NOT this item (pictured above, with band members on cover).  _  The official one, is actually a ""Sober"" EP Maxi-Single, made in Holland (an import), and has the same artwork as most of the other ""Sober"" EPs (a gray man's head/torso, with hand pointing, set to a murky/smokey background -- blue, gray colored cover; and has a proper, ""pressed"" disc... NOT a CD-R... Comes in a slimline max-single case, NOT a standard ""jewel case"" with square ""artwork"" (if what's shown can be considered artwork). __ PS: You can buy the OFFICIAL one elsewhere for well under $20, as it is not too rare or highly sought after.",0

Five Stars An amazing collection. I would give it 6 stars if I could.,1
"A mis-step Ok, it would be hard for anyone to cover this Britney Spears hit with any success, but Klein is especially ill suited to the task, probably because she's north of 35 and this is teeny bopper territory not meant to be tread by a brainy Jewish songstress.",0

"New Found Glory Doesn't Age New Found Glory never really age do they?  They've been around for awhile.  I can't act like I was there from the beginning but I am definitely glad I have started listening to them in the last few years.  This is a great happy, summer disc.  Bethany Cosentino was a great addition to Caught in the Act as her and Jordan's voice blend nicely. It's hard to pick out songs that are better than others because nearly every song has a chorus that'll have you hooked and singing along.  Good release and lucky for us they aren't done yet",1

Five Stars this is a smooth song one of the best of sades music I have ever heard,1
"wonderful!!! This is an hour of calm, relaxing, Tibetan bells.  It's meditative but not trance-y. Not like some of the new age garbage that everybody associates with meditation. I used this to teach a restorative yoga class, and my students actually commented on how much they loved the music. I love it, too, so I guess I did a good job buying it!

P.S. It's more expensive if you buy it on iTunes. Almost twice the price!",1
"Rebecca Black She sounds better in this song, but she just talks about herself - which shows what a vain, spoiled, and, greedy girl she is. I hated Friday but I hate this song just as much.",0
"The Greatest Artist Since Tiny Tim Rebecca Black's follow up to ear shattering ... uh EARTH shattering musical classic ""Friday"" is nothing short of a historic masterpiece.  La Black's vocals rival the sounds of a flock of crows picking over discarded garbage.  The video is like being on a jury of a murder trial and having to look at graphic photos slaughtered victims.

Could we please stick our leaders in Washington DC into a room and force them to listen to this?",0
"Not A Moment When it has came down to Rebecca Black, she definitely has honestly the worst debut song in the world with Friday. It was just so awful, I felt like I wanted to just vomit all over. Here latest single, My Moment though takes it a step almost at par, but fares at a bogey with her showing she could sing, but just chose not to do it well in the first place. It at least is a better attempt from Rebecca musically, that she could sing, by not being a flat-head. Still, I just honestly don't know if Rebecca will release a full-length record anytime soon, but this song surely shows it is not her moment and just a novelty act.

Song: D+",0
"Rebecca Black: Adorable! This song: Forgettable! Read my other reviews to see how I feel about (Rebecca) Black Friday. Since then, she appeared in Katy Perry's hysterical TGIF video where she cemented what I've felt all along. She's a talented, adorable, bankable TV star who should get a series built around her on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel ASAP.

I was hoping for much more on this second effort. They did a nice job toning down the Auto-Tune. The real problem is the arrangement. Sounding like it was produced on a 2003 Sony VAIO, the rhythm lurches around like a warped 7-inch of Debbie Gibson's Out of the Blue. Where Friday wormed its way into the pop culture canon with a winning combination of iCarly and MMMbop, this song is ""all about the Becca'mins"" and nothing to do with the things her audience can identify with (or dance to at Junior Prom). Perhaps it can be covered as American Idol's obligatory, abysmal coronation song in 2012.

Here's hoping we see much more Black on the TV or Silver Screen soon.",0

"""Bottoms Up"" to Oscar Brand on the greatest collection of drinking songs. This is the greatest collection of drinking songs every assembled, period.  Oscar Brand is accompanied on banjo and vocals by Erik Darling (of Weavers and Rooftop Singer fame).  Darling's banjo is the perfect counterpoint for Oscar's 12-string guitar.  There's not a false note on this LP.  Sadly, it was never released on CD (although Oscar made a variant of it about ten years ago called ""100-Proof Drinking Songs,""--good, but not great. It is, however, still available, and well worth a listen.)",1

Five Stars wonderful song....the remaster is very clean.  worth the purchase for sure.,1
"sorry, no! I'm really sorry, but I cannot give this record more stars. I am a great fan of Klaatu, but Dee Long's new versions are so flat, so boring and lifeless that I ask myself why he has done this. He should have gone for his own songs and left the Klaatu songs Klaatu songs.
Unfortunately these reissued Klaatu songs lack the brilliance and the passion of the original versions. The drums are absolutely boring and there are hardly any peaks anymore.
My advice is: listen to the original Klaatu songs: they go off like a rocket!",0
"Some great music from a great guitar player Dee Long is a great guitar player and his playing shines through on this CD. A mix of Dee's solo stuff and remakes of some of his Klaatu gems like Hanus of Uranus which he rips up. If it's possible, his remake is better than the original... and that is saying a lot... the original was a fantastic rocker. I thoroughly enjoyed this album.",1
Five Stars Awesome guitar playing mexica version of incubus!,1
"Intuition, Technique, Bravery This is a great release from Scientific Map. I have been listening to Rust Belt Soul for weeks and each time I hear something new. It's obvious the five members are extremely talented: the technique is rock solid (even stunning), the solos are inventive and purposeful, the vocals are honest and potent, and the songwriting is nothing short of admirable. I've been converted to Rust Belt Soul, and if you give it a listen, I think you will be, too.",1
"Exactly What I Needed These tracks are great.  Much easier than using any kind of timer, even a good interval timer.  The music is kind of repetetive, but for this application, I think that's best--they really stay in the backgroud while being a lot more fun than silence.  If I had to listen to them for a long time, I'm sure they'd get monotonous, but Tabata workouts are, by design, short.  The coaching on the coaching tracks is super cheesy, but you only need to listen to that a couple of times before you can take your cues simply from the music.  If you want the easiest possible (not a single extra piece of equipment and cheap!) option to guide you through Tabata workouts, these are exactly what you need.",1

"Great CD! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was that the songs tended to sound too similar. While that wasn't ""bad"" I felt it held the overall CD back. I liked Prey for Eyes and Clients more.",1
"huge disappointment (especially after having read these other reviews) in other words: don't trust any review but mine.

THIS CD SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE CLIENTS!
i didn't BUY the last cd, but from the few songs i heard off it, i could tell Red Chord had gone in a completely different direction but still kicked ass. that cd must've been ill received because they've clearly reverted back to the production and sound of Clients here.

songs 1 and 2 of FTtTM are amAzing. i had my hands up in the air the whole time i listened to 'em in a ""jesus, it's so brutal i can't take it!"" sort of gesture. i was blown away by the deep peculiar balance of brutality and despair therein. i was TOUCHED.

and then i heard every other song. from songs 3 to 12, Brad Fickeisen uses roughly 3 beats (i'm being reductive on purpose. that was the IMPRESSION i got (that there were no more than 3 beats used), and impressions are worth as much as truth in art, damn it); the riffs become a LOT less interesting; and the vocals are the same throughout (and haven't changed much since Clients, so i'm not blaming Guy too much here).

the lyrics are choppy and at times sappy. ""Face Area Solution"" is a sensitive jam, entreating women (or people in general) not to get facial reconstructive surgery. the singing's BRUTAL in the song, but the nice and considerate lyrics clash too violently, methinks, with that brutality. the rest of the lyrics are just too vague. vocals nevertheless sound good (if not a tad too unchanging).

on a last and hugely all-refuting note:
songs 1 and 2 are so good they're almost worth the 5-12 bucks you'll pay for this cd.",0
"Look what I found! This artist is incredible! The sound production is incredible! Delooze, and the record label ""Gash Digital"" are producing some of the best beats today, period. This album, along with other Gash Digital releases have strong Deep French house influences (my favorite). Delooze is definitely an artist to keep an eye on. Supposedly she is releasing her first full length debut album soon! I'll be impatiently waiting for it. However, This album is absurdly good. The remixes are well worth the money, and each one is DISTINCTLY different from one another, and they all sound incredible. Buy it! Support Delooze! and this sort of music!! I hope she comes to the States, West Coast, LA :)",1

"I wanted to like it. I really did. I rely on hypnosis tracks to go to sleep.  I am also an avid lucid dream participant.  When I got bored of listening to the same two (reliable) hypnosis tracks, I ventured out to seek something better.  I bought this album because of the 5 star review that the other user wrote and was enthusiastic to use it the same night I purchased it.  What could go wrong with a hypnosis album meant for lucid dreaming?

I am not saying entirely that this album is bad. There are good points that I would like to point out. First of all, the script used is very well thought out. The trancey binaural tones in the background are flawless for the purpose of each track.  Unfortunately, all this effort goes to waste with poor mixing.  When the narrator's voice comes in quite suddenly, it is several decibels higher than these tones, causing you to jerk out of that trancey state.  After several failures from almost achieving a wake induced dream state, I began seeing horrifying distorted images of faces in my closed-eye visuals. So what went from a blissful state quickly turned into a nightmare until it was so unbearable I had to open my eyes.

I gave the album a few more tries the following days, but again, I was jerked out of the trancey state and was never able to fall asleep. I don't recommend purchasing this album.  I am not discrediting the usefulness of hypnosis tracks, nor am I discouraging people from trying to achieve a lucid dream. I am a firm believer of said two things, but this album is not what you want.",0
One Star I did not order this,0

"Not original versions from the album and missing songs I grew up listening to this actual vinyl album at my Grandparents house. When they passed, I inherited the album. It is the only version I have ever heard. Therefore when I got this CD in the mail yesterday (after years of looking for it) I was super thrilled. The first thing I realized was that it is missing several tracks from the album (including 2 of my favorites). And yes, I now see that next to the title it says six songs, and they are making their own compilations (as I also now see in the description ""CD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com"".) So basically, they are burning their own CD's as they are ordered. I really do not care that they are producing them, but please do not put an album cover on the product that NONE of the versions are from. It is misleading. I am 100% positive these are not the versions from the original album. Sarah Jackman's phone number on the original album is 418-9749. On this version it is 418-2792. Not that I am saying these versions aren't funny, just that I wanted the original versions from the original album. It looks like I am going to wind up converting a few of my Grandparents albums (Pat Cooper, Lou Monte, etc.) that you cannot get on CD myself. If you are not concerned with having the exact album versions, then this is fine. He is funny no matter what, but I was looking for the CD version of the ORIGINAL album.",0
"Not the Original - Beware! This version is not the same for two reasons.  It is only six songs out of 10 or so on the original as the title says if you bother to read the parens.  Some really great songs missing!  Also, to make matters worst, part of what made this album one of the best selling comedy albums of its day was the venue -- some kind of party with lots of cognoscenti (i.e., Jews from Brooklyn and ladies of Hadassah) who laughed and laughed and laughed some more.  It is really a sham for Amazon to sell this product with the same name and cover as the original.  I have not written a review of any kind for about 3 years, so congrats Amazon, you got me going with this on.  Not Allan's best.  Incomplete.  Not the original.",0

"learned what ""riddim"" means. I first heard ""Nuttin Nuh go so"" by Notch on satellite radio station, and found the album here and purchased it, without doing enough time listening to the samples.

So, now I know that Riddim means the exact same beat for every song.  Not sure why this would be popular, because after 3 or 4 songs, I was ""what the heck?..."" and finding another album on my ipod.

If you like the exact same beat over and over and over (and over and over....), then you might like this.  Now I know, and won't buy another in this format. Find one or two songs you like and just buy those tracks.",0

"CHICO Definitely BORING!
Where is the brasilian sound of Chico Buarque we all know?
The songs in this CD are so slow... and they all sound the same way...",0
"uninspired and  retread quality Chico Buarque owes nothing to anyone--at least, this is true musically.  He has written some of the finest songs to come out of Brazil in the last 50 years.  Chico has synthesized multiples of cultures,untraditional harmonies and classical forms.  His lyric writing has been politically astute and, at times, carefully evasive.  And when writing of romance, myth, or social malaise, he has been acutely intelligent--without pandering to any school or transient phase.  And this doesn't even take into consideration his plays, ballets, novels, and commentary.

Sadly, he has not produced much affecting music in the last 20 years (""Dois Irmaos"" of 1990 is his last worthy effort).  This cd, like his last four or five albums, is an extrusion of meandering melodies and earnest, but uninteresting chord progressions (still--some very nice open-string harmonies). My Portuguese is not as good as it should be, so I don't think I amcomfortable judging his ""letras."" I look forward to a fair assessment from another of his admirers (there are legions, justifiably so).

I will always purchase Chico cd;s because his worst efforts exceed almost anything produced in the pop vein outside of Brazil.  But this one is not memorable.  ""O Quw Sera"" is the apogee of Chico's work.  I don't know if he is capable of reaching that height anymore.",0
Great Metal!!! They were on Metal Massacre 7 with Heretic and the Mighty Flotsom and Jetsom.

"Amazing! One of the most fascinating new artists I've heard in a long time The Latin music scene has been a bit monotonous for the past couple of years. For some reason they all sound the same and we are kind of tired of Shakira an Juanes. Thank god Flor Amargo came along! I haven't heard anything so fresh, so powerful in a long long time. It has the most intersting mix of sounds, that take you from pop to electronic to pure and simple rock and even a touch of cabaret and burlesque.
This is a very interesting CD and I could say that at least 9 of the 10 songs are amazing. She is a very powerful performer.
I am glad we now have a new artist to look after. Welcome Flor Amargo.",1

"Too good to be true? The rating doesn't not in any way reflect on the merits of Nazareth's output--it only examines this specific product. This seems to good to be true--an mp3 anthology of Nazareth's catalog on one CD. And indeed it is:
1. Although it doesn't claim to be the complete compendium, the anthology is missing two albums--""Close Enough for Rock N' Roll"" and ""The Fool Circle.""
2. The disc, despite the printed legal disclaimers and warnings, is a budged Russian bootleg, and not of a high echelon--the flies do not feature any accompanied artwork--it's bare bones, sound files only.
3. The sound quality is generally fine, except the defect on some files on ""Play 'N' The Game.""
4. In some cases, the albums feature bonus tracks, but in some (ex: ""Expect No Mercy""), they do not.
Even with such shortcoming, it may be worth buying just for the wealth of amazing material that it does have, but don't try ordering it from Round3--you will get a CD of Soviet military choirs, guaranteed. They sent me same wrong disc twice, each time re-listing the Nazareth disc with a price hike, so it went from $11 to now $20. You can find this disc for $11 elsewhere, but if you're shopping for a compact medium of Nazareth catalog, you may want to look into other similar anthologies, for example, the two disc versions.",0
"really should have bought something more for car this is for at home to learn to meditate, not for a car listening cd. will have to try in the house and use the practices. but nothing so far that you cant learn to do on your own if you know the basics of yoga and meditation.",0
"Really good meditations - use headphones though! Let me say that I Adore Rod Stryker's ""3 Meditations to Live By"" CD (pureyoga version).  They are the backbone of my daily meditation and I use them frequently.  So when I found out that Rod had released this CD of meditations I purchased them straight away, along with Meditations for Inner and Outer Peace.

I have now done all of the meditations on Four Desires.  The Bliss meditation is my favorite in this set. I noticed straight away that 2 of the meditations in this set are ones that Rod has recorded before.  The Healing the Heart meditation on this CD is the same as the ""Empowering the Heart"" meditation that I have on my precious 3 Meditations to Live By CD.  And of course, the Relax into Greatness meditation has been recorded on the CD released previously with the same name.

I found that listening to the meditations with headphones sounded lots better to me than listening to it through my stereo.  Something about running the sound through the speakers seemed to make the little imperfections in sound more noticable.

It's really a great set of meditations.  The only reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is the delivery by Rod.  He just seemed more....caring and into it on 3 Meditations to Live By (as an example).  His delivery on these CDs seems quite a bit more ""business-like"" and matter of fact.  Also, there's no chime at the end of each meditation, so sometimes I'm not sure if the meditation is done or not unless I look at my iPod (transferred the CD).

But a great set overall....recommended.",1
Easy way to add sounds to your computer ... Very good product. Happy with my purchase.,1
"interpretation failure I've heard just another interpretation, by Kronos. After that I Molinari's interpretation sounds like they don't 'hear' the music, just play notes.",0
"Anachronistic temperament, and a certain lack of excitement in performance I really hate giving a reduced rating, but I have to honestly say, this CD is a disappointment on several fronts.

The first problem is the anachronistic temperament (system of tuning).  It is a Renaissance-era tuning, from at least 100 years before Pachelbel, suited for music of one or two keys, and possibly a very few closely related keys, but certainly not for every key, or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel (or anyone from his era) composed for.

I was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era, which would sound authentic with music by, for example, Scheidt and Sweelinck.  One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S. Bach on such an organ, and little by Pachelbel for that matter.  Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime?  Maybe, maybe, I'm not saying it wasn't possible.  But I consider it highly doubtful he would have just sat down on played anything, in any key, on it.  He would have said, 'Oh dear, one of these anciently tuned monstrosities, let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys.'

Imagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find (A) no mention whatsoever of the (admittedly intricate) topic of temperament.  So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin' out-of-tune.  And more surprisingly ... (B) the organ is not from the 1500s at all, it was constructed in 1702.  OK, the shoe has dropped;  the temperament is simply wrong.  That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died;  it was during J.S. Bach's teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys.  I believe all church organs of era, certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers, were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in ""MOST"" keys.  I cannot accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner.  MY OPINION!

If you want authenticity in old music, the instrument (and temperament) must match the composer's ideal, not simply be ""OLD"".  Otherwise, it's like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950's burger joint.  Yes, historic, but totally the wrong time period.

And in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner, not the organ builder or rebuilder.  So, yes, FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner.  It could be made into modern equal temperament, or one of the 'well-tempered' Baroque temperaments, by the NEXT tuner (with permission of the owner of course, which I hope they would give).  FYI.

The other problem with this CD is that it is played ""introspectively"" and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings.  Why that is, I can only speculate.  It was the organist's decision.

Here are a few thoughts on each track.

(1) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament.  Also, played delicately and with many registration changes.  This is a first year piece, quite easy and I would prefer to hear it played robustly, beginning to end.

(2) Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections.  The first is not ideal in this temperament, but tolerable.  The second is very sweet indeed.  The music is very simple, I have played it at Lutheran funerals.

(3) Wir glauben all' an einen Gott - This has a highly decorated chorale melody, making it undiscernable (to me at least).  Of course, that is Pachelbel's doing, not the organist's.  I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo.  This one does not suffer much from the temperament.

(4) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern (Lutheran) churchgoer:  O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright.  It is delicately played and easily recognizable.  The temperament is not a detriment.

(5) An Wasserflussen Babylon - OK.

(6) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds OK in this key.  I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness, it is played introspectively.

(7) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress.  Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD, and indeed what I bought the CD for.  This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday.  I am sorry to say, the temperament does not do this piece credit--it simply sounds like a neglected, out-of-tune organ.  Or at best, one which Pachelbel would have said, 'Sorry, it looks like we can't use this particular organ for this particular piece' ... in my opinion.  Also I am disappointed it is not played very joyfully.

(8) Chaconne in D minor.  Temperament OK but again not played with much fire.

(9) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change?

(10) Fugue in D minor.  The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel.

(11) Toccata in F.  Once again, far too restrained, although the temperament sounds good here.

(12) Nun lob, mein Seel', den Herren - OK.

(13) Toccata in C minor.  I have just figured it out.  He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and didn't want to disturb the neighbors.

(14) Werde munter, mein Gemute.  Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today.  OK, I do not expect fireworks on this piece.

(15) Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.  Another better-known Christmas hymn, ""From Heaven Above"", which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season :) Now, get this:  AARGH!  The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively, THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ.  (It is a conspiracy against me! :)

(16) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece, sounds OK.

(17) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last, another fugue played joyfully, high time!

(18) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital, he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire, and instead was very careful and conservative.

Note, I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales.  Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches ....

There is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can highly recommend:

"Such a Moving Melody, and a Beautiful Voice I own this CD and ""Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier"" is hauntingly beautiful.  I love Suzy Boggus' delivery of the song, which makes me feel the pain of the woman-in-love left behind because her love has gone to war.  I love each song on this CD - and love that it preserves so many American folk songs and puts them in their best light.  My favorites include ""Froggy Went a'Courtin'"" and ""Rock Island Line.""  ""Froggy"" uses a Jew Harp which makes the song so much fun!  and ""Rock Island Line"" has a great rhythm.  Suzy almost ""updates"" the music while managing to be true to the original song.  (I don't know how she does that!)

I don't remember if I purchased the CD via Amazon, but I have paid to download a few of Suzy's songs from Amazon for access to personal devices.",1

"Real Biker Rock to Candy StreetCar Rock Why did Jo Jo Gunne tail off in popularity following their first big release with the hit Run,Run,Run? Hard rock bands really liked the sound of that hit and those type of guys were the folks that really supported it. Some of the other songs on that album rocked, but from there the band adopted more of a pop,southern california teenybopper sound rather than the tougher hard-driving sound from RunRunRun. There were exceptions but Jo Jo lost it's focus on the more serious sounds. I mean bikers dug ""Run"" but they couldn't hang with much of the rest Jo Jo Gunne put out.

"Beautiful I have almost all Sophie Zelmani's albums, and this is the one I least liked on first listen. It sounded bland and, dare I say it, boring. Then I loaded it on my MP3 player and started playing it when I went walking at dusk every day. Within the next two listens this album had me mesmerized and is now my favorite Zelmani album.

The album consists almost exclusively of ballads...backed up by some of the most beautiful acoustic guitar work you can hope to hear. The songs are mostly about love lost. Ready is the leader of the pack here and has to be one of her best songs ever. It gets ample support from the rest of the material.

The only song that feels slightly out of place is Interior Design, and it would perhaps have been better at the end of the album. The alternative version of To Know You (found on a previous album) is also negligible and not better than the original version.

I'm The Rain is a wonderful album, and lovers of acoustic guitar driven ballads in particular will find plenty to appreciate.",1
"DON'T BOTHER The company, or individual, or whoever made these discs of the SWING ERA by simply recording them from the 33 LP RECORDS onto CD's obviously had no skill and doing so, took no time to help enhace the music, and obviously didn't even listen to see if the needle skipped during play. PATHETIC. I have the original 78 of this song by the REAL GLENN MILLER Orchestra, and MY 78 SOUNDS BETTER than this STEREO LP tansfer version does. In fact, I have the same ORIGINAL LP myself, and MY VERSION THAT I RECORDED OFF THE LP ONTO A CD, and then REMOVED THE SNAP CRAKLE AND POPS from it, then ENHANCED the audio, IS F A R SUPERIOR to this version.

Terrible sound quality (at least at reasonable price) I was interested in listening to this historical recording of a Handel opera that does not get recorded much. I was very disappointed. The sound quality was terrible. I guess we are not used anymore to how bad things sounded back then. I was more disappointed at what I missed - it all indicated that the singers had great voices. Some sound engineering would go a long way to provide a quality recording. At least the price I paid was very low,0

"An admirable album is sleeping into EMI's vaults! This legenday archive is a fabulous compilation of part of the supremacy of great pianists playing Chopin.

You'll find Rubinstein in his best years (decade of the thirties), Alfred Cortot, Geza Anda playing and admirable Etude, Scherkassky,Malcuzynski playing a memorable Polonaise and the legendary Horowitz, gathered for first time in this admirable in Chopin's memory.

I bought in LP forty years ago and I still regard it one of my golden treasures. It would be a marvelous idea to exhumate this gem in CD format.

Please, if some people is reading this review and is close to the Top Management of EMI, please, give them the new. They have a diamond and it seems they have forgotten it.

"Music is great, but CD is monophonic The music and voices are great, as you know if you have the Firestone Stores LP from the 1960s. However, while the LP was available in vibrant stereophonic sound, this CD is monophonic and sounds a bit ""pinched"" as though too much digital noise reduction was applied. If you have no other access to this music, here it is, but be aware that it could - and should - sound better.",0

Review of Floyd Cramer album This album was not at all what I had hoped for.  I purchased this for my elderly mother as a Mothers day gift and she said most of the songs were not even Floyd Cramer playing.  The only one that sounded like Floyd Cramer was his Last Date song.  I was very disappointed...especially since I bought it as a gift.  The description of the album did not mention the songs were remastered or I wouldn't have purchased this.,0

"Not just beautiful music Not only is the music moving, beautifully arranged and performed by a group of stellar musicians, the proceeds of this album go to God's children around the world. Through Crabb Sr. with Servants of the King, money from this album goes to building orphanages, schools, leprosoriums, hospitals, and churches in India and Africa.
I have always felt strange about buying something in order to give money to God's people, but in this case I truly would have bought it anyway. Win/win? Sure. Then I factor in the increasing burden I have felt to give back, to change the world, to see the Kingdom grow... I asked God yesterday morning to give me a way to show the world, specifically children, His love. Then I heard about this album. Wow. So, really it's just another day I ask myself, ""If we aren't the Body, who is?""",1

Gurumaa's voice is very soothing and comforting the listener.

Gurumaa is embodiment of love and her voice reflects her love for the human race.

I would consider this Yoga Nidra CD suitable for all (beginner, intermediate and advanced level). During the meditation, Gurumaa guides us for mantra chanting, visualization, deep breathing, etc.",1

Nasty price and sender When I ordered it I thought I was going to get at least 3 CD's covering his work like the best of Andrea Crouch which I bought a few years ago. But I only received 1 .

"Nice try, but I'll pass I really wish I could give this a positive review, because I was down with the concept - nerdy pop songs for comic fanboys (& girlz). Unfortunately, the acoustic pop-ballad approach just isn't working for me. I'm sure this will go over big with the audience that bought the (pop music) ""soundtrack album"" CDs for the Batman & Spider-Man movies, but musically, it's just too simple for me. I was hoping for an upbeat power-pop thing with playful riffs and hooks, maybe along the lines of Weezer or The Apples In Stereo, but this isn't it. There's a sameness to it, from one song to the next. The songs themselves are well-written and I can appreciate all the comic book references, but I just can't imagine listening to this more than once or twice. Too bad, but good thing Amazon had samples to listen to. I almost purchased this unheard, based solely on positive reviews and the nerd-band concept. Oh well, can't win 'em all.

Your mileage may vary, as they say in the commercials. Feel free to lambaste me with your ""don't listen to this guy"" comments.",0
Five Stars Very pleased with this music.,1
"there isn't anything i like there isn't anything i like ""most"" about it---really not for someone wants to relax and/or sleep---the pieces are way to fast (lots of notes in short time frames)..just so conscious of someone playing piano music that is not that good as music--but the point of ' for sleep aid'  music is to not be ""good"" in terms of quality, substance--we need repetition and soft flow without being annoyingly repetitive--this cd doesn't offer any of the requirements for relaxing/sleeping - for me.",0

"Music IS Life Just wanna say I've been following Paul since the '90s. He's returned to his roots in a big way as he represents ace selections of
Trance, Psy, Progressive, and Breaks. NMTB stays true to the sound while excelling at being fresh and new.
This mix was released just before We Are Planet Perfecto Vol 1.
Both are awesome current EDM but I'll take this one as the more solid choice.

Anyone like a bit of MUSIC in their EDM? Paul constantly knocks it out and knows how to flow melody and harmony. Not too jarring but the right amount of edge and groove, fast seamless mixing, upbeat friendly BPMs. I give it extra points for not beating you over the head with diva vocals. Just not my thing and that's what radio tunes rely on.

You know you want it. Just get it.",1

"Haunting and Beautiful I happened upon this album sort of by accident...I heard an interview with Anna Clyne on NPR and loved what I heard, so came to Amazon to do a search...and discovered this gem. Each song tells a story, with the strings sounding like they're breathing. The compositions are intricate and complex in an incredibly beautiful way. There is a sense of melancholy that is very engaging. I look forward to more of her work.",1
"A deeply offensive song - Trace Adkins is way out of line Trace Adkins has always been a first-rate song stylist, able to project huge emotional power and stylistic range.  All of his classiness and talent gets erased, though, by ""More Of Us,"" a bonus track on the ""deluxe edition"" where he embraces the most corrosive aspects of ""tea party"" politics, first playing the victim card by whining about the imaginary oppression of ""us"" true-blue, red-blooded, God-loving, flag-waving Americans and calling for ""real Americans"" to ""push back"" against the nasty people who supposedly hate God and need to be reminded that ""there's more of us than there are of them.""

Now, I'm pretty sure that I have a few political differences with Mr. Adkins and whoever wrote this song, but I gotta say, it really ticks me off to have them talk about me -- and other people -- as though I don't deserve to live in America and that having a different point of view makes me some kind of a traitor. I was born in America, I love this country, I pay my taxes, I go to church and I vote in every election, and I have as much right to my beliefs as anyone else. Talking about ""double-checking"" who the real Americans are is probably the single most un-American, unpatriotic act that anyone could make, including big Nashville stars. We're all Americans, and we should respect one another -- that's part of loving America.

This kind of tough talk and destructive, violent, let's-have-a-civil-war, chest-thumping might sell a few records, but it isn't going to help solve any problems. Frankly I'm disappointed and embarrassed to hear one of my favorite modern artists sink so low. You should be ashamed, Mr. Adkins. This is truly unworthy of your talent. (Axton)",0
"Five Stars Amazing DJ tool.  Gives a deep dark cinematic ""all the feels"" dimension to your set.",1
"Nice Extras I have to admit, Klaatu is a total guilty pleasure. These are they guys that pretty much created ""Space Rock"" with songs about interplanetary craft, tranversing the universe in 80 days, a scientifically accurate song about neutrinos, and a bona fide space rock opera on side two of the album HOPE. Throw in some nice, though odd, love ballads with decidedly Beatle influences, and you have a unique and rather obscure listening experience.

Really, ""Rarities?"" I was a little skeptical, but after listening to this, I am quite pleased. You can't get more obscure than some of these remixes. I mean, who really cares? Well, I do!

I especially like the reworking of ""Silly Boys,"" and the shortened version of ""Calling Occupants"" works well for me. The live set at the end is rather nice, and they have a wonderful live version of ""Little Neutrino."" Good stuff.

An added bonus is an alternate version of ""Hope"" with a little dialogue by the Lighthouse Keeper that appeared lyrically on the LP HOPE on the lyric sheet, but was not on the album. What a nice ""hidden track"" surprise. I was not so impressed with the MAGENTALANE out takes, but I never really warmed to that album.

If you are a Klaatu fan, this is really fun. If you are not, I would suggest starting with the first album or the retrospective PEAKS. The purely instrumental takes are of interest of those of us who know the songs, but the sans vocal tracks might not make a lot of sense to the uninitiated.",1
Perfect Beach Wedding Music! We used this for a beach wedding on Topsail Island. The bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the beach to this music. It was perfect music for a beach wedding.,1
Semper Fi My son is a US MARINE and he is the one that told me I should get this song and everytime I listen to it I think of him..Thanks Trace,1
"Excellent run on a few classic riddims This compilation features some excellent Jamaican roots music, and is well worth a listen. In particular the smoldering performance by Hortense Ellis, Alton Ellis's sister, on ""Hell and Sorrow,"" and Errol Dunkley's re-imagining of the song as ""Black Cinderella,"" are worth the price of admission not to mention Big Youth's run on another version.

On top of that, you've got another great Dunkley tune and some classic tracks from Leroy Smart, including of course ""Mother Liza.""

The only drawback, I'd say, is that the versions come so hot and heavy. From ""Hell and Sorrow"" to August Pablo's ""Cinderella in Black,"" all the way to ""Zion Youth"" by Vin Goron, you get 6 versions in a row on the same riddim comprehensive, sure, and unquestionably filler-free. Still, neophytes into the world of Jamaican music may get some ear fatigue.

Nonetheless, 5 stars all the way.",1

"You know why there's only one `s' in desert, right? This song confuses me, or at least the opening does; which sets itself up to deliver an intriguingly atmospheric industrial influenced track only to drop that wavelength altogether and jump into a variation of 70's southern rock.  The song itself has merit, for in parts it is soft and nicely rendered, but there are too many aspects of this track that miss the mark.  The overly repetitive musical arrangement is simple to a fault, especially when the track lasts for nearly eight minutes.  It wears out its welcome by presenting us with no real variations in tone to keep us interested.  The vocals, while interestingly muffled, become almost lazy sounding after a while.  I love the lyrical content, which is inspired and interesting, but as a whole this song fails because it lacks balance.

I can't say I'm truly intrigued here.",0
"Fantastic irish duo, amazing album This album is amazing! The pipes and fiddle are so locked in with each other, it takes me to a place of pure happiness. This is great adrenaline music, too. In my car whenever I hear the pipes drone start, and then Mick's chanter busts in, I turn up the volume and drive a little faster. And, great tunes, too.",1
"And a buzz it will give you! I freaken love this CD.  If you like fiddles and pipes, you will love this stuff.  If you don't, then you should probably go back to your Miley Cirus collection or something.

So I purchased this CD(Leon Berry at the Hub Rink Wurlitzer- His First and Rarest Recordings!, Vol. 2 ) with out any worries because I loved 'Beast in the Basement'. I love the fidelity of this CD every song is crisp and you can hear every Glockenspiels Traps and all of the Pipes.

"pronunciation is terrible. I appreciate the idea of having a non-native ... Dude... pronunciation is terrible.

Disc 4 contains a cleverly edited version of the question and answer promo disc from 1975 with Mike Pinder asking the questions, plus the single versions of the songs and for a real bonus, a wonderful NEW song from Ray - The Trouble with Memories. The package is rounded out with postcard reproductions of the artwork for both albums and a booklet containing archive and new photographs, artwork, lyrics and a new interview with Ray. If you're a Moody Blues fan, this is indispensible, even if you have the existing CDs. If only Ray had made more solo albums.....",1

"I don't like the Rafael Hernandez CD I bought I ordered Rafael Hernandez songs and all I got is some of his instrumental music and no songs.  I wanted to hear his old songs being song by old artists, instead the CD is all instrumental (modern instruments).  This should have been clarified in the CD before purchase.",0

"Great song! Poorly encoded. This song sounds great when one can find a decent recording. The MP3 from Amazon is a ""no-go.""

SOUND QUALITY
1. iPad with built-in speaker: Tolerable.
2. iPad with Apple Ear-buds: Obviously limited frequency range, clearly sticks out from other songs: marginal
3. IPad with Sennheiser 500 over the ear headphones: limited frequency range; ""pushed"" dynamic range. Distortion ruins what little of the song which remains.
4. Denon/Martin-Logan/Bi-amped Polk LSi tower speakers: ""Could someone please turn that off?""

PROBLEM
Well, there can't be too much of a problem when the song was less than a dollar, right?  Yet, other songs in the same price range are consistently worth 4-stars in Sound Quality (the limit of sound quality for an MP3, based on the amount of lossy compression applied). What happened?
1. Too much of an attempt to increase the dynamic range through use of a compressor on the final mix-down track?
2. A multi-generation recording, in which multiple forms of compression and conversion had been used. Where's the Master?
3. Product Quality Control. Granted, Amazon QA listeners can only listen to so many songs before their head feels like it's about to explode! I am sure an existing application can be tweaked to analyze each contributed song for preset frequency range requirements, dynamic range requirements, harmonic distortion levels and other audio specifications. Those songs that are rejected, can be listened to, to determine if the song is intentionally manipulating sounds for effects purposes, and passed or failed. To send this song out, at any cost, is a poor reflection of the Music Services offered by Amazon, or any other music distributor.",0

"Talk about LOVE.. Another song as a narrative for a moment
in Prime Time TV.
I heard this during a very sad episode of NBC'S
Miami Vice. The background vocals are timed
perfectly, they are beautiful, & they sound
like a church choir; Gospel in fact.
The title of this song is universal, the search
for love is something that we adults look for
all the time. Yes, we want to know what LOVE is
when we are hurt by what we thought LOVE
was. Especially when we gave, & feel we didn't
receive.. A Beautiful song that raises a life
question that needs definition by faith in 
LOVE.",1

"Only one song is good for me. I have got almost all of Ronan's album and by far, it is one of the least favourite album on my list. It will probably just stay in my CD shelf...",0
"Sounds bad I listened to the samples on this album and think Ronan was the wrong person to interpret Burt's songs. The singing isn't very good and I can't warm to his voice at all - it's like he's trying to make Burt's music sound cool for today's generation, but it backfires on him, as his voice sounds really, really shocking in places.  I saw this album at another store today, and thought, should I buy blindly? I'm so glad I didn't, as I would have been extremely disappointed.

The last singer I enjoyed (who collaborating with Burt)  was Elvis Costello on the Painted from Memory album. I really enjoyed his singing and the orchestrations for that album. Sadly, there is no warming endorsements here from me. I enjoyed Ronan when he was in Boyzone, and love music of the 1960s, but this album is one I won't be buying.",0
"Not Ronan's Best Work at All I like Ronan Keating, but this album just isn't any good.  His voice isn't right for this kind of music, and it really shows right from the first song.  The vocals don't mesh well with the music.",0
"Country Music's Newest Super-Group ""Hell on Heels"" is the debut album from Pistol Annies. This country super group features Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley. They are incredibly talented musicians, singers, and song writers, and anyone who listens will be impressed with their brand of country music. Their songs cover everything from domestic frustration (""The Hunter's Wife""), the female virtue (""Beige"") and good ol' fashioned rebellion (""Hell on Wheels"" and ""Takin' Pills""). The music is awesome and features a classic country sound with some blues, honky-tonk and bluegrass influences. All three women share lead vocals on different parts of different songs, and the results are amazing. Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!",1

"Wil Takes The Beatles To Jazztown Wil pulls together some deep tracks here from the Beatles' huge catalog. His unique interpretations run the gamut of Jazz styles. Some songs are faithful to the original like ""Can't Do That"" which is rendered in a jazzy rock style with the guitar part mixed forward and Wil's smooth tone and beautiful phrasing almost singing to melody to us. Or ""Hey, Bulldog"" a guitar forward piece with staccato three part horn hits. And, ""Fixing A Hole"", the title track, oozing with sweet Cool Jazz lines.

Did I mention that Wil plays all the instruments here? Yep. If you're a musician, listen closely to the guitar chord voicings. His harmonic sense is impeccable. The bass playing is excellent too. Again, Wil hops between styles and creates -- not mimics -- riffs of every flavor.

I've had the pleasure of seeing Wil perform live in Austin, TX when he lived and played here. You must see Wil live in New York where he lives now. He is a humble, gentle, musical genius who has one of the best alto tones I've ever heard. Wil loves and lives music, and there's a light in him of joy that's infectious.",1
"A great Jazz player! I have to say that I really love this CD! It's on my iPod, on my computer and in my car. Wil Greenstreet is true musician, technically perfect and very adaptable to any genre and artist. I love him most when he plays songs that he writes. That's another story. This recording exemplifies Wil at large with the Beatles and boy does hit he do it well. I wish the world could hear Wil.  More like this please Wil.",1
"Wil - it aint Mozart but it's great music : -) Althoagh Im not familiar with all of these timeless melodies Wil has breathed life into these in much the same way as Charlie Parker
did  with a smaltz string orchestre backing to some well worn standards. As a former jazz bass player  I liked Wil's lines a lot!
Well done! Be interesting to hear his take on some more of the Beatles. Eleanor Rigby? Norwegian Wood?",1

"The Narration Spoils It As with their previous SACD releases, the German recording label Tacet manages to brilliantly capture a splendid performance by the Polish Chamber Orchestra, led by Wojciech Rajsk. The timbre of the instruments feels almost palpable. And that's exactly why this disc is so frustrating. In order to hear these incredible musicians at work, one has to endure the overly affected narration that permeates the performance. On top of that, Prokofiev's original text in Peter and the Wolf was forsaken for a new and extended one as told by an owl, while Saint-Sans's Carnival of the Animals got a totally new narration where originally there was none. These changes dilute the music, robbing the works of their natural continuity.

This is undoubtedly a subjective assessment, since the overall length of this Peter and the Wolf at 31:32 is just a few minutes longer than Andre Previn on a Telarc CD at 27.22. Nevertheless, it does feel like an eternity when one is so eager to hear more of the music, although kids might actually enjoy the experience, and they are after all, the target audience.

As for Tacet's so-called Moving Surround Sound, despite some unorthodox shifts in the placement of the instruments, it is done rather creatively and fits the playful mood of this specific repertoire, at least as far the stereo SACD layer is concerned. Unfortunately though, the narration takes center stage most of the time and left me wishing for Peter and the hunters to leave the wolf alone and go instead after the poor fellow doing the honors.",0

"4 1/2 Stars, Deserves a Bigger Profile This is an exceptional album on so many levels. It didn't necessary make the same emotional connection to me as the previous two albums, but you could see the maturation and progression musically. This is definitely his most varied (and even accessible) album from a musical standpoint. It is refreshing to see that he is not allowing himself to be confined by the constraints of the label ""singer-songwriter"". Along with this being a more textured album from a musical and sonic viewpoint, it also posses many of Mangan's considerable gifts. He is an insightful, articulate & witty lyricist. His voice also continues to be a powerful emotive instrument. This album is not only worth your attention, but Mangan also deserves a bigger profile (outside of fans of CBC Radio 3). Hopefully this album helps him to continue to do so.",1

"A different experience than expected... I am going to write this review as unbiased as possible.  And I do accept responsibility for taking a chance on buying this CD as it was a.) mixed by someone I never heard of b.) it was coming from the Czeck Republic and c.) there were no other reviews to go by.

What I was hoping to get was a compilation disk - containing a number of dnb artists like Teebee and Stakka & Skynet that fall into the nerofunk/futurestep category of this genre - to me one of the most creative, unique and progressive areas of dnb that mix together spacey verbed out sinister atmosphere's, hard, edgy heavily filtered dark and evil synth/bass lines, and beats that are along the techstep line but have more presence and are generally at a slightly slower tempo around 170-175 beats per minute.

While the disk did include the artists I mentioned above, rather than expanding upon the sounds of nerofunk/futurestep Koogi chose to completely soften (marshmellowize if I can coin a term) the experience by mixing a chill, loungy, groove oriented set targeted to the martini bar hipster crowd.

The dark and sinister tones of minor and disonant keys used in nerofunk/futurestep were transposed to more ""easy on the ear"" sounding major keyes - the pads were joyous and elated instead of being mean and ominous.  The basslines were subdued instead of hitting your mind like a right hook, and gorgeous sounding female vocals were overlayed throughout, which I just don't get as this ain't supposed to be HOUSE.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a good neurofunk/futurestep experience, take a pass.  If you want to try out something in dnb and like chill grooves this may be interesting to you.

On a final note, Koogi does mix well, the quality of the sound is very good and I received the CD very quickly even though it came from Eastern Europe.",0

It has a very different sound, which I really enjoyed and the words in the  song itself, captured me. What came across to me in the song was that even if I know God (which I am privileged to say Yes, I know Him, some) there is more to rediscover.  There are sides to Him that I need to know; that I don't know it all, but I can go on a road of discovery and rediscovery of God.  There may be some that the song doesn't do it for them; because we all have different ways that music touches us; some may not like the style  of the artists but to me, the song is Golden and just brings me even deeper into His presence and desire to be seeking His face.",1

"Sleep to this? OMG, I just listened to the sample of this soundtrack, and I honestly can't imagine sleeping to this, even if I was really, really tired. Much less using it to go to sleep if I was having insomnia....

For soundtracks that actually work, you want something with Binaural Beat Technology built in, and a soothing backgound sound. Excellent ones you can get from Amazon include Kelly Howell's one with the identical title, Slow Wave Sleep, with a ocean wave background. And if like me you find ocean wave sounds less than ideal, Kelly's Sound Sleep has a very restful musical background. Just type Kelly Howell into Amazon's search box.

Sadly, Amazon doesn't have samples of Kelly' soundtrack's on it's site, but Kelly's site does. Google BrainSync. You can listen to samples there, and buy an MP3 download cheaper than a CD. But if you want a cd rather than an MP3 download, come back here to buy it, since Kelly charges too much for shipping and still takes a while to deliver.

It's a matter of debate among producers of soundtracks, but some people claim that a CD will work better than a MP3 copy, since the binaural beats are compressed in a MP3. Possibly true, but the MP3s do work. Do they work as well as a CD? I really don't know....

Be aware that these soundtracks are designed to slowly take you down into the sleep state, gradually going deeper and deeper. If you are having trouble going to sleep, listening to them will most likely get you there. Even if not, you will at least get very calm, which is much more restful than tossing and turning. But listening to them over and over all night will be counterproductive, since when the soundtrack starts over, it returns to the ""awake"" level, and then spends some time ""taking you down"" again.

Another use is when you need a ""nap"" in order to be awake and alert later, or simply don't have time for a full nights sleep. These soundtracks will help get you rested and energised.

Warning: binaural beat technology works by putting different sound frequencies in each ear. So unless you have a stereo source, at least moderate hearing in each ear, and use stereo headphones they won't do anything at all.",0

The tracks from this album that appear on the Geffen compilation ""Singin' & Swingin'"" are the proper stereo mixes, so good masters are evidently extant.

"Tribal Pop Gem Big Village calls their style ""tribal pop,"" which basically means that they produce funky rock with quirky lyrics, world music influences, full, female vocalist harmonies, and a great rhythm section with some African drums. If you can imagine a cross between the Talking Heads of ""Stop Making Sense"" (only less weird) and the Brand New Heavies (only without horns), you'll get the general idea. On the group's third album Up, singers Rachel-Ann Cross and Jaqui MacMillan, backed up by a stomping, soaring orchestra led by bassist Henry Cross, prove that hope is still alive, at least in the Washington D.C. suburb of Takoma Park, MD. Our ladies of song show that they are nothing but attitude -- good attitude, for a change. The lyrics are clever, as on the rhyming, silly song ""Whena, Whena"" or the poetic ""Woman on the Way to Heaven."" Just when you're wondering where that world music influence went, it comes out in full force in the passionate Arabic-rock number ""Euphoria.""

This is danceable, upbeat music for people who are attuned to the world around them. A gem. ~ Kurt Keefner, All Music Guide",1

Unfortunately, this album was ""remastered"" at THE WRONG SPEED. ""Side One"" plays too fast, and all three vocalists sound like chipmunks. There is a humorous element to hearing the baritone growl of Fred Turner pitched up to alto, but overall a huge disappointment. I would normally grade this album at three to four stars, but until it's mastered at the right speed, it gets zero stars from me.

This song was purchased because I was curious.  Would it live up to my expectations?  Can Joanna really hold a tune?  Does this song get stuck in your head frequently?  Yes, yes, and yes!  I really enjoy listening to this song and will for many times to come. It's very catchy, just have to stop myself sometimes when I am out in public from singing too loud... I have resorted to humming it whenever possible.  All in all, this song is a welcomed addition to my music collection.  Great job!  (Like all of her other work, obviously... since I already said that I'm a fan of hers and BA).",1

"Good song I don't consider myself a big fan of Mute Math. I have a couple of their songs, saw them play at a free music fest downtown this summer - enjoyed them a lot. I heard this song on the radio and liked it enough to write down a snippet to look it up later. Turned out to be them. I don't know whether it's good or bad I didn't immediately recognise them, but there's nothing wrong with a band evolving in style.",1
"The most bland song by Mutemath Imo, this is one of Mutemath's worst songs to date. I don't care if it's the single, people will eat up what is popular. But to a Mutemath fan, this is very bland and uninspiring. The chorus is, ""Blood Pressure, do better....keep rising, blood pressure."" Boring. It just sounds like every other retro 70s rock band out there right now. Mutemath is better than that and I hope their next album goes back to the atmospheric rock sound. They are just too good at it to just completely abandon it.",0
"Not digging the new MM The guys of MUTEMATH are extremely talented. But I'm just not digging their new sound at all. This isn't what brought me in to the beautiful rock that MM was. The self-titled album had some of the most amazing songs I've ever heard by a band. Armistice had its gems too. But this new album seems like they're reverting back to the 70s. I just miss that atmospheric rock sound that MM had that made them one of my favorite bands. After listening to the new album, I can say I am thoroughly disappointed. ""All or Nothing"" and ""In No Time"" are amazing tracks. Other than that, all the songs sound pretty much the same. Crazy drum fills along with 70s style guitar riffs. If you were a fan of their previous albums/sound, be careful. This is nothing like how they were.....and that's a bad thing.",0

Beautiful. I just wish the song were longer :)",1

"Simply Put - 'Bad Prog' Wow, now this is BAD prog!  From the first song with the cheesy chipmunk sounding electric keyboards (I guess a synthesizer or something along those lines), the 3rd song - the majority of which sounds like a melody or riff taken from an early King Crimson song, bad vocals, to the overall cheesy sounding pompous nature of the keyboard effects, lyrics, and overall sound.  It does get somewhat better when you get to I guess what was the final song on the original release (What Is  Is What, the 4th track on the CD) and the following final song, which I guess is a bonus 5th track added to this Japanese import.  The last song is just some electronic doodling (instrumental), but listenable (sort of reminds me of Kit Watkins or someone like that).  I think this was supposed to be their second and last release that actually was not released until a few years after it was recorded.  After hearing it, Im surprised it was released at all; but like I indicated the 4th song, which I guess was side 2 of the original vinyl clocking in at 19:51 minutes, is somewhat listenable (I say only somewhat).  I was thinking about also getting their first release, but NOT anymore after hearing this one.",0

"Squeeze's Stunning Debut Revisited: Disc 1 of 2011's Most Ambitious Tribute Burning Sky Records - the label that has already released killer tributes to Jellyfish, The Posies, Roxy Music (with a tribute to NZ's Toy Love coming in September) - is back with their most ambitious tribute yet.  If I.... If I... If I... The Songs of Squeeze Revisited is a 4-disc, 50-track album covering Squeeze's first four albums (U.K Squeeze, Cool For Cats, Argybargy, and East Side Story) in their entirety and in their original track sequence.  Check out the songs of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook in a whole new light - it is a fabulous listen!  (The 4-CD album is ONLY available from the Burning Sky Records website).

Released in 1977, the John Cale-produced U.K. Squeeze introduced the world to the magic of Squeeze.  The album presented Squeeze at their wildest - they had an edge to their sound that was unique to this record.

Covering an album like U.K. Squeeze would be a challenge.  We strove to capture the wild abandon of the original album while giving fresh life to each of its songs.  Here's a brief take on the tracks, with some thoughts from the bands/artists themselves:

1.) Sex Master - After a gorgeous, Jellyfish-esque opening, US band Steve Sizemore Group rocks the heck out of the album opener, with guitar, piano and Hammond organ all ""rocking it out like the world was coming to an end.""

2.) Bang Bang - UK band Keshco provides a fun, quirky take on the song, ""playing up the whimsy in the verses and the yearning in the choruses,"" with a ""funk-out at the end"" to ""top off all that pent-up frustration.""

3.) Strong In Reason - US artist Christopher Watson provides an updated New Wave take on the track.  ""What started out sweet and tentative became edgy, taut, and mechanical,"" Chris says. The track also features cool angular guitar from Trees' Dane Conover.

4.) Wild Sewerage Tickles Brazil - Japanese band Penny and Ashtray take a surreal approach to the album's lone instrumental - they strove to ""represent the song's alter ego in a parallel world.""  Their cover has all of the delicious creepiness of the original version.

5.) Out Of Control - Speaking of ""creepiness,"" US band Trees amps up the creepiness appropriate to the lyric while at the same time making a very catchy cover.  Trees' Dane Conover wanted listeners to have ""little beads of sweat trickle down their forehead"" when listening to this one.

6.) Take Me I'm Yours - US band (by way of England) Sartre's Lobster give this classic Squeeze track a decidedly Middle Eastern feel, using the song's ""lyrics about bellydancers, camels and the Golden East"" as a starting point, swirling with a ""a kind of '70s, vaguely Led Zeppelin-esque vibe.""

7.) The Call - US band Robert Mag & The Number Nine put a powerful, Bowie-esque slant on this track, rocking it up more than the original version - very cool stuff.

8.) Model - UK band The Slingsby Hornets amp up the energy on this track, employing ""a Brian May multi layered guitar feel, over a 90s influenced Redd Kross style powerpop/glam backing, with the addition of a few analogue synth sounds.""

9.) Remember What - Spanish (by way of the US) artist Amelia Ray considered numerous potential approaches to the song, ""but the funk won out"" on this inspired cover. The majority of the song is sung in 7/8 time, with the bridges switching to 4/4.  It is funky indeed!

10.) First Thing Wrong - US band Ocean of Algebra ""took a very loose and open approach to the song, and ""ended up getting kind of an Ocean of Algebra does the New York Dolls does Squeeze type of sound.""  Singer Jim Hiskey's vocal is not to be missed!

11.) Hesitation (Rool Britannia) - US artist D A Karkos takes what I always felt was a so-so song from U.K. Squeeze and turns it into something amazing. Karkos says, ""My approach to this song was pretty simple. I wanted to make it more of a hard rock song and less of a jam. Slowing the down the tempo and coming up with a new riff that worked over the original chord progression seemed to do the trick.""  I'll say!  This cover is flat-out sick!

12.) Get Smart - US artist Wayne Cabral closes the disc with a blistering take on the track, dialing up the energy while maintaining the ""punkabilly"" feel of the original.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, this track (and disc) will leave you wanting more!  Good thing there are 3 more discs to go... :)",1

It definitely fits with Lisa's signature sound, despite not having been written by her or Ian Devaney. The remixes (by Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez and R. Kelly) spice things up as well. Unfortunately, something was still missing and the song did not make much impact on black or pop charts (actually it is hard to pinpoint it as either genre). I like this track but it definitely comes across as weaker than her other material. Then again, weaker for Lisa Stansfield means Grade ""A"" quality compared to other artists out there!

"One of the best recordings of its kind It's about time I shared my life-changing experience with three of Michael J. Emery's recordings:

1.  Complete Confidence 2.0
2.  Put Off Procrastination
3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes

- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.

- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!

- Had I tried similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery's recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!

At the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.

The two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are:

1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery's verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.

2) The most effective image/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I've ever listened to, is an ""ice cube"" metaphor on ""Complete Confidence 2.0"" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of previous failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.

With these recordings, I was able to build ""Complete Confidence"" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.

This prompted me to ""Put Off Procrastination"" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.

For those with a ""fear of success"" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won't lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. ""Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes"" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just ""getting through"" challenging situations.

""Complete Confidence"" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and ""Put Off Procrastination"" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.",1

"Good sound (until the last act), of a mostly undistinguished performance This is a review to Verdi's La Traviata, recorded in 1941.  I see it is already attached to La Boheme, and Lord knows where else, by Amazon.  It is their doing, not mine.  Now about this Traviata ...

I am a big fan of Jan Peerce and particularly regretful of the fact I didn't go hear him live, although I had the chance staring me in the eyes and stepping on my toes.  It was about 1980 and he was doing Traviata at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I was all dressed up and ready to go, and then I read a review in the paper which said it was ridiculous to have a 76-year-old Alfredo hobbling around the stage with a cane.  And so, because I was stupid, I thought, oh dear--I don't want anyone to see me there, if the reviewer thought it was bad.  And so I missed out.  Now he is dead, and the moral of the story is:  don't be stupid, and miss out.

Well, this particular recording is interesting in a way, but mostly because it's surprisingly mundane.  Peerce is Peerce, he does a great job, but there's nothing shocking or new.  If you have Toscanini, then you have Peerce (in much better sound).

Let us put to rest the very pleasant myth that everything that came from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, during the Golden Age, was automatically a masterpiece.  This is without a doubt the scrappiest (note the politically-expedient leading 's' on my chosen adjective) Traviata ever to come from a leading house.  The conducting is uninspired, to put it charitably.  The tempos are mostly S-L-O-O-W-W, and it is simple time-beating.  Now when I say 'mostly' slow, that implies that some of it is not slow.  That is true.  The Dr. scene is the most hurried Dr. scene ever to grace wax.  This guy was REALLY late to a golf appointment, or maybe he had to go to the little boy's room.  Whatever it was, he had to get the heck outa there, FAST.

About the Violetta, who I have never heard of (not that that means anything).  She is labeled as a soprano, but I swear has the beautiful, well-rounded voice of a mezzo.  And guess what else?  She doesn't do any top notes.  Have you ever heard a Violetta who avoided the top notes?  I'm not saying it's bad, but certainly is unusual.  There is something else a little different.  She uses some different words.  In Fors'e lui, she doesn't sing ""Gioir! Gioir!"", she sings ""Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!""  And there are other words she uses in certain areas, but I don't know what they are.  That is certainly different.

Altogether it is an unsettling Violetta and I will have to say, if she could sing Violetta at the Met, so frankly could any of the talented ladies singing Violetta at community opera I know with no apologies whatsoever.

Lawrence Tibbett is father Germont, and I am sure you are aware he is one of the greatest baritones of the 20th century.  He is giving it everything he has, and it actually detracts.  Yes, I am afraid it is an odd mix to put him in this mediocre production.  It is like having a New York Steak with potato chips and diet orange soda on the side.

The score has been cut, of course.  The standard cuts are taken, and then some.  Even the parts of the two messengers ('La signora e partita', and 'Una dama d'un cocchio') are cut.  Alfredo just asks who's there, then proceeds to read the letter.  So you are telling me at the Metropolitan Opera they didn't have anyone who could take these 10-second messenger parts?

Now about the sound.  The sound is very good for the age, up until the last act.  Of course, it is not as good as Toscanini of 1946, but then again, nothing of that era is.  It's certainly as good as, actually better than, the live Callas Traviatas of 15 years later.  Then beginning the last act, there is an annoying series of ticks or bumps that won't go away.  When it first starts, one might say it's not too bad.  But it goes on the whole act, and it strains the limits of tolerability.

So the good stuff here is Peerce as Alfredo, which can be best enjoyed with Toscanini, and Tibbett as Germont, which is better enjoyed with Ponselle.  The rest of it is altogether 'meh'.  Of course, it is cheap, but the question is, do you want to spend the time and sanity when there are SO MANY truly excellent Traviatae out there??",0

Five Stars Ordered by mistake.,1
"Great songs, written and performed from the heart... The songs on THESE ARMS contain a number of influences - folk, country, blues, Cajun (reflecting Mark's heritage).  One of the wonderful things about this talented duo is how seamlessly they can blend these, sometimes within an individual song, into a viable whole that is simply great music that not only touches the soul of listeners, but brings nourishment to their minds as well...not to mention inducing them to a good bit of foot-tapping in the process...and the urge to dance.

Seven out of the eleven tunes on this album are Mark Viator originals, and they clearly illustrate what a fine writer he is.  He's also a very talented guitarist - almost all of the guitar work on the recording is Mark's.  Whether he's fingerpicking or flatpicking, or playing slide, it's always masterful and appropriate, and never showy for the sake of it - it's all about the music and what supports it best and conveys the mood.  When Mark shifts from accompanying lyrics to adding a spot of lead, the seamlessness is wonderful to behold.  If you're fortunate enough to see them perform live (which we do every chance we get), you'll understand this even more. The songs here that were written by others (Thad Beckman, Robert Earl Keen, Kate Wolf and Hank Williams) are as well-chosen as the originals are well-written, and suit Mark and Susan to a T.

Mark's Cajun heritage is never far from the surface.  `Queen of the bayou' is a heartfelt tribute to his grandmother, a tasty stew of memories and love.  `Ain't goin back' is an honest look at the life of a proud Louisiana working man, a vivid picture of resilience and devotion to family.  `Dharma bums', as one might gather from the title, was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel, and wonders eloquently if the idealism the book inspired in many of us when we read it the first time can be carried and kept alive as our lives move along.  Susan's voice carries Mark's original `These arms' to sweet heights - it's a beautiful love song, extremely moving, and one you'll find yourself humming it before you realize it.  Her renditions of Kate Wolf songs (`Across the Great Divide' appears here), as well as those of country legends such as Hank Williams (`I'm so lonesome I could cry' gets a beautiful reading on this album) and Patsy Cline (if you're lucky enough to see them perform, ask for `Walkin after midnight'), are all nothing short of wonderful, and Robert Earl Keen's `I would change my life' illustrates that she can give new life to more contemporary songs.  She makes everything she sings her own, reaching down into her artist's soul to color them with shades from her own palette.  When the two of them blend their voices, the harmonies are perfect and the chemistry is intimate - you can get a sense of it from just listening, but again, seeing them perform in a live setting makes it abundantly clear that they love what they're doing.

Many of Austin's finest musicians lend their talents to this recording.  It never feels over-crowded, rather like a conversation among good friends, where everyone has something to contribute but no one attempts to dominate.  Every track flows easily along, without production getting in the way of the material.  As I said earlier, this is simply great music - well-written, performed with heart and talent, and a complete joy to experience.  Pass it up at your peril.  I don't think I'm allowed to insert a link to their website here, but if you do a search for them, you'll find it - there are samples available there, and you'll hear what I mean.  If you like what you hear - and if you enjoy great music, I feel sure you will - check out Mark's earlier solo album BAYOU TCHE, filled with more finely-crafted original songs (one co-written by another great Austin-based songwriter, Slaid Cleaves), and his solo acoustic guitar offering WIRE & WOOD, showcasing his instrumental talents.  They're both excellent.",1
Five Stars Such a help when I'm stressed and my thoughts can't calm down!,1
"No flow, generic beat. I think the reviewers must either be friends of the artist or have never heard any other rap before...but this is just horrible. I'm sorry to say.

First...the rapper has no flow and stays to the one style the entire album.  Second, the beats themselves while bangin' seem to be recycled through out the album.

I know this is his first album, but if you got skillz, it'll show on your first release...but this album just doesn't have that. At all.  I'm sorry, but save yourself the money and buy something else.",0
I love it Awesome song!,1
An anthem for gamers around the world If you play video games you NEED to listen to this song,1
A true gem of an album. Josienne's voice is captivating--truly beautiful and easy to lose yourself in it. This album is a wonderful compilation of original songs. Her guitar playing is crisp and clear. Overall the album is a true joy!,1
great sound effects I bought this for my dog because fireworks petrify him and I wanted him to get used to the sounds before the 4th of July.  I played the CD for him every night and then gave him his favorite treats.  After just one week he seems much calmer than when I first played the sounds.  They are very lifelike with whistles and super loud pops.  Excellent sound quality for whatever your reasons are for buying this CD.,1
"Just as fun as the show As a fan of the show, and owner of the entire series on dvd I can say this box set is well worth getting. I also own most of the other next gen cds, as I'm a completist. It's presented well. One of the highlights of the set is the huge booklet which talks about each episode presented. Lots of colour photos. It talks also about each composer. One composer for the first 2 discs, then guest composers for the third plus extras and alternate takes. I liked hearing Picard's voice on the main title. It would be great to get some more naration in other soundtracks. I always thought that It would be a good idea. Scary, light hearted, comical, soaring and interesting is some of the words I could use to discribe the music. A track from ""The Big Goodbye"" was one of my favourite pieces as I like music from film noir and detective stories from the 1940's. I think the music from the next generation is magical, exciting, futuristic and cutting edge like the visuals in the show.",1
"Amatuer quality Horrible  Extremely poor quality recording.  Sounds Tinny, shallow.  background louder than foreground sound",0
"Great Album from beginning to end! Non stop Headbanging! Sangre's new album the Great Tribulation is seriously one of the Best Metal albums I've bought in 2011. I like every song on here. The songs are really heavy and make you want to Headbang until your head falls off. Every song is great but if I had to pin Point my favorites they would be the first track ""Vengeance"" It's straight up Death Metal with some Black Metal elements added to it. The Vocalist growls mixed in with his High Pitch Black Metal Screams makes this song stand up to it's name. It's full of bloody Vengeance.
The Title track ""The Great Tribulation"" intro riff is sick! Another very Death Metal and Black Metal influenced track thrown in with some very Gutenberg Swedish Melo Death inspired riffing reminiscent of At The Gates mixed in with some Dissection.  Very Heavy but Melodic at the same time. Another stand out if I had to chose, and trust me it's hard to pick a song cause they are all brutal and awesome would be ""Forever I"" This song if I had to describe it would be Thrash Metal meets Tool. This song is really heavy and makes you want to thrash and get stoned! The vocalist mixes in his growls and screams with his melodic vocals. Not many Metal vocalist can pull this off but his voice is great. hahahaha. Sangre mixes their Thrash Metal/Death/Black Metal influences really well with the great Melody of Swedish melo death with a dash of progressive Metal. Seriously all 13 tracks make you want to headbang and circle pit. Also the Drumming is freaken excellent. Great crazy Fills through out the songs. Reminds me of Danny Carey Meets Dave McClain of Machine Head on crack with great Blast Beats and Double Peddle Action! Oh and to top it off, The Bass is actually played the way it should be, playing along to the Drummer! I GIVE SANGRE'S THE GREAT TRIBULATION 10 OUT OF 1O! METAL AT IT'S FINEST. i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO FANS OF TOOL, MACHINE HEAD, SLAYER, AT THE GATES, PANTERA. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL HEAVY METAL FANS! THIS ALBUM REALLY MIXES IN WELL ALL THE DIFFERENT GENRES OF HEAVY METAL! FOR FANS OF THRASH,DEATH, BLACK METAL AND JUST METAL PERIOD!",1

"Basic Songs for Ballroom dancing This CD is great if you are learning Ballroom dance. It has a good variety of songs, from waltz, foxtrot, chacha, rumba and more. I bought it because I was talking a ballroom dance class and needed music to practice with, each song tells you the style. For a few styles they give to two songs with different speeds. There is a slower waltz and a fast waltz etc. Have fun!",1

STAY AWAY FROM blends of cr@p that call themselves ""CHRISTIAN"".  honor God and pray for wisdom and discernment.",0
A Classic everyone loves This is one of the classics that I seem to never get enough of.,1
"Ian and Sylvia Folk Music First Country singers later Ian first met Bob Dylan.... and they soon took off from there.  The Ian and Sylvia I know.... were solid folk music people.... no rodeo... no country. This one's a good example of that.... and shows what range and ability the 2 of them had. Back in the 60's other beatnicks would here their music... get their guitars out... and actually improve the melody and add to it.  This oldie brought back memories of just how much talent there was during those times.

Amazing talent! David Acton's voice and the words of the song speak to my very heart and soul.,1
"Great Guitar Music I gave two stars because I was hoping for Garlands voice along with the guitar.
The Guitar was exceptionally done well, I was hoping for voice too.",0
"not your Judy Garland, but better. I love the Israel Iz Kamakawiwo'ole  version of Over the rainbow...  I needed something recognizable , yet flowing for a background to a slide show... this worked, plus I can sing a long with it",1
How is this song not a massive hit? Love this track. Just so catchy and fun. The original is excellent too with soome nice harmonies. Not sure how this or orig wasn't a massive hit. if it was I guess I missed it.,1
One Star Didn't  like it,0
"Avoid it Waste of money. First of all, this is all instrumental, so nobody actually sings in Italian. Most of the songs have absolutely nothing to do with Italy. For the most part, the sounds like a MIDI generated performance piece. Perhaps the person who compiled it was Italian, but otherwise it was a waste of money.",0
Way too short for a meditation The music is pretty but way too short for any meaningful meditation session.  Perhaps it could be put on an MP3 player and used for a one or two minute deep breathing session to calm oneself during a tense moment at work before going into a meeting.,0
"Bad investment! I could have recorded a better quality ... Bad investment!
I could have recorded a better quality version with my phone.",0
"Be Fearless... and listen! A blissful blend of reggae, hip hop, rock and roll, jazz fusion, electronica and Jam...and thats just one song! These folks are amazing live, devoted to their fans, and so service oriented that it flows throughout this music with ease. Every tune is accessible and the musicianship is faultless. This disc is one in a string of great discs from a Minneapolis based band that sponsors it own festivals in southern Minnesota, and gets out and about just briefly every fall to tour the midwest. If they get close to you, DO NOT MISS!",1
Good for runners as others in gym mode The music is a bit fast for me but I would say the music works.,1
"Not very energizing I found this album to be not very motivational for me - during my workouts, I felt compelled to skip to the next track to find a good beat to work out to.  Most of the tracks have a tempo around 132 - 136 beats per minute, which doesn't fit my walking or running cadences (I need 120 beats per minute for walking & 150 bpm for running).  Still, I tried using it for my gym workouts (weights/calisthenics), but I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Perhaps the most motivational thing about this is the girl on the album cover...",0
"Horrible Thought I am sorry.  But if you are suppose to study to Brahams Lullaby, I believe you haven't put much though into this product.  Do not recommend this track for studying one bit-  some of these songs are what I believe to be a prank.

Good luck with studying - you will do better with out listening to this poor product.",0
"The piano pieces sound like practice pieces I don't know how this type of poorly executed covers of classical music can help you study. The piano tracks are particularly terrible, with missing notes, accidental key presses, and a rythm that sounds off tempo. The selection is great, but the execution is poor.",0
"A Great Piece of Art Max Soelzer's album - comfortable like a favorite leather jacket, broken and fitting. Utilizing mastery of the Gospel theme and his own brand of creativity - hinting at Buffett here, Santana there, Influenced by blues on one track, the piano driven tunes of the '70s on another, and a handful of the other tried and melodic journey-bound masters - Soelzer takes us on an enjoyable Gulf Coast ride as he searches his soul.",1
"Terrible compilation lacks artistry Thoughtful of my 14 year old to purchase this for my birthday, but the piano playing, which is 5/6 of the album is completely soulless.
Beware when an album lists no artists!!!!

Promising Great promise,1
"orgullo guantanamero Excellent music, great performance by both artists, such a good blend of cuban & flamenco style, they both are great",1
Great local Baltimore music I heard about Bosley from the 98 Rock radio station in Baltimore.  They would occasionally bring him in studio and play some of his tracks.  The music is fantastic and I'm enjoying listening to the album.  I'll be on the lookout for new music!,1
Great dancing track I'm obsessed with this song. Great dancing track.,1
"The sound quality is awful Save your money. The sound quality is awful. Unless you are a collector and want every possible version of Lohengrin, skip this. It's horrible.",0
Wonderful performance. Thirty years ago this was my first recording of Lohengrin and I was happy to listen to it again. Keilberth and the Bayreuth Festival orchestra are recorded in decent mono sound. The MP3 quality very listenable. I particularly enjoy the performances of Steber and Windgassen. Steber has a wonderful voice and I have promised myself to listen to more of her recordings. Lohengin was the perfect  role for Windgassen. The recording finds him singing lyrically with less dryness than would be later heard. It would be nice if the acts were indexed. This is an excellent performance at a very affordanble price.,1
Five Stars Love his voice so stinkin much!,1
Instrumental ... If you like instrumentals it's just fine.  That isn't what I was looking for.  The sample player doesn't work again (still) so I couldn't preview it.  I bought this one song to make sure so I lost a buck downloading a song that isn't in the format I want .....,0
Good Music! Good Music!,1

"PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO..... myron sharvan is another amazing Buffalo NY  icon who has broken through with this debut offering as the leader of world coyote project.myron has miles of nationally recorded band names in his back pocket where he was a studio ace guitar guest.he had a vision and went about the task of assembling some of todays greatest names who form world coyote.myron does things one way....""THE RIGHT WAY""....from his creative writing,and composing  to picking an all star cast of musicians who share his extraordinary creativity.he has an unusual but finely tuned idea of what he wants to play and record.his music opens the eyes and ears of his already huge local following and new fans that have jumped aboard the world coyote project train.he does this by not compartmentalizing this project into a specific genre.he has something for everybody here.staggering blues riffs,melodic instrumentals ,power guitar driven classic ""hit ya in the gut"" rock.he has mastered his own genre,as most of todays truly gifted artists are opting to do.the face of rock will continue to break off into new tangents daily,with the emphasis on delivering the goods you want and will keep.
As for the players ,i mentioned myron did not go halfway. HE'S ALL IN....he shares guitar duty with Phil Brown,the guy who has shared studio and stage with such names as little feat,and the latest Kool and the gang release.he has written for the likes of Cher,Kim Carnes,Kix,Bonnie Tyler,and Steve Perry to name a few. James Anderson holds down his half of the rhythm section as bassist. James has rocked with both Winters Brothers and their bands,Arc Angels,The Stratoblasters,and numerous other nationally recorded artists. Jimmy ""Z"" Zavala,has added spice to many quality artists works. Dave Stewart of The Eurythmics fame calls ""Z"" the greatest harmonica player in the world. That is an accomplished resume,but to add to his list he wasn't passed up by Rod Stewart,Bon Jovi,Tom Petty,Yes,and with his saxophone skills he adds zest to alot of our favorite artists music.""Z"" has been named Etta James' ""hoochie coochie man"".Bruce Bowland fronts this amazing group of talent. Bruce founded and performed with the Blackbirds who featured a guitarist by the name of STEVIE RAY VAUGHN!
As for the music this is an intoxicating blend of finelyweaving golden laced amazement.""Almost Home"" the title song is the killer on this writers review of the whole cd.it'll drive ya to tears,it is one of those songs that won't leave your mind once its gotten in. What is realized here is that it is possible to be powerful without pounding wattage down your throat,as is exemplified in ""SNAKE BITE"".The lead off song ""SHARE THE BLAME"" is another example. A well written song lyrically,a song for the thinking man,but what is so spellbinding is how myron phrases the guitar work on the intro. An old rock/blues trick that gives you some insight into its soul,the lead break guitar solo. After this solo the power of the band blends beautifully to climax and finish your best girl off.myron is no show off guitar player ,he just plays with his heart and soul to give you absolute harmony laiden music.""LONG SHOT"" is another well constructed piece of this beautifully created puzzle in which all the seamless soulful wonderment comes together to reveal the tapestry that is myron sharvans ""WORLD COYOTE PROJECT""
I wish i had the time to walk this cd door to door to blow some minds......buy it so you can enjoy it blowing yours.",1
One Star insipid lyrics and hacked beats. Boo,0
"Cant stop listening. Awesome album.  It radiates amazingness.  Its an album you can let play all the way through and they do a great job of mixing the styles and sounds to keep you on your toes.  ""That Thing"" and ""Two Different Worlds"" are by far my favorites even when every song brings something to the table and makes this album complete.  I was lucky enough to hear some of this before it was released and it hasn't come out of my CD player or off my phone since.  Going on 4 or 5 months now and its still great everytime.  I hope they don't stop here and keep on pumping out music of this quality.  Thanks AB!!",1

"A  John Ragsdale tune A John Ragsdale tune beautifully executed by Glen Campbell.  This piece of music, like so many that Mr. Campbell chose to do in his early years, I feel represent some of the best work that he did. This musician was always underrated, probably because he wasn't a writer or perhaps it was something else. But whatever the case, some really great and memorable music came out from the mid-sixties to the early seventies. I recommend that anyone who grew up with Glen Campbell's music get this and any other from that time frame as it will evoke many sweet memories.",1

"These ten songs to summarize a decade? Really? Yes, these songs were all popular enough individually; throw in some Larnelle Harris, Steve Green, and Twila Paris, and you're all set for a lite-pop church service. Nothing wrong with that. But as a group these songs hardly represent the 80s, unless the CCM songs that ""defined a decade"" were all MOR ballads, plus one novelty track not really representative of Randy Stonehill's folk-rock center. I had many of those transparent cassette tapes pictured on the artwork, making mix tapes off of cassettes, CDs, and the occasional LP. I promise this collection does not resemble what CCM was all about in the Reagan years.

It's almost as if arena rock (Petra, DeGarmo and Key, White Heart, AD), New Wave (Mad at the World, Flock 14, Crumbacher, Farrell and Farrell, Bryan Duncan, Charlie Peacock, some Michael W. Smith, Steve Taylor, some Daniel Amos), hard rock/metal (Rez Band, Stryper, Whitecross, Bloodgood, Shout), alt-rock (Altar Boys, The Choir, Adam Again, The Swoon, The Violet Burning), rap (DC Talk, and...um... The Raptures?), singer-songwriters (Keith Green, Billy Crockett, Mark Heard, Phil Keaggy, Michael Card, Amy Grant, Leslie Phillips, Billy Sprague, Margaret Becker), pop country (Kim Hill, Steven Curtis Chapman, Paul Overstreet, Morgan Cryar), R&B (Take 6, various Winans, Jon Gibson), and whatever you call Carman never happened. Who puts only ten songs on a compilation released in 2011 to cover music 20-30 years old? Quite the half-hearted cash-in effort on behalf of Word/Curb/Warner Brothers.

"Down the rivers of the windfall light Although Mozart's prolificacy was lifelong, 1784 was a special year for him. During this annus mirabilis, Mozart wrote no less than 6 piano concertos (all masterpieces, K.449 through K.459), the Quintet for Piano and Winds K.452 (in Mozart's own words, the greatest thing he had ever written), the great C Minor Piano Sonata (K.457) and the ""Hunt"" String Quartet in Bb (the fourth of the six ""Haydn"" Quartets). All of this in less than 12 months.

During this remarkable year, the 9 weeks between 2/9/1784 and 4/12/1784 stand out, transcending mere fecundity:

February 9, 1784: Mozart completes the Eb Piano Concerto K.449
March 15, 1784: Mozart completes the Bb Piano Concerto K.450
March 22, 1784: Mozart completes the D Major Piano Concerto K.451
March 30, 1784: Mozart completes the Quintet for Piano and Winds in Eb, K.452
April 12, 1784: Mozart completes the G Major Piano Concerto K.453

This is astonishing - some might even say miraculous - even for Mozart. In recent years many scholars and musicians - particularly of the HIP variety - have sought to demystify Mozart, to knock him down a peg or two. Musicologists have been keen to point out his flaws and seem obsessed with the prosaic details of his life and work, and HIP practitioners have endeavored to bring Mozart ""down to earth"" with roughed-up, sweaty, ugly sounding performances. The goal seems to be to endlessly remind us that Mozart a mere mortal. The Zeitgeist commands that we scoff at notions of divine inspiration. Mozart was nothing more, the musicologists tell us, than a very clever man.

Yet when we listen to the music we know better. And in spite of their ongoing efforts to mortalize Mozart, no musicologist has been able to sufficiently address the miracle of 1784. How did Mozart do it? How could any man create no less than 5 masterpieces in less than 9 weeks? It is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and one that no scholar, no matter how learned, will ever be able to answer - just as physicists will never be able to explain the deepest questions of existence.

This recording is a hidden gem of the catalogue. It pairs Walter Klien - one of the keenest Mozarteans who ever lived - with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski (SS) and the Minnesota Orchestra. Klien's way with this music is wonderfully idiomatic. His instrument of choice was a Bosendorfer Imperial, which allows for fortepiano-like transparancy without the hideous sonorities associated with period instruments. Klien is a master of legato - each note sparkles, but his touch is percussive enough to make Mozart's keyboard lines both sing and dance.

As a ""B"" label, Vox employed some scruffy regional ensembles - some not much more than pickup bands - to record the Mozart Concertos with Klien (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Complete-Solo-Piano-Concertos-The-Voxbox-Edition/dp/B009T2XPC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Complete Solo Piano Concertos (The Voxbox Edition)</a>&nbsp;In the 60's and 70's he was paired with the Mainzer Kammerorchester with Gunter Kehr (K.414, K.456, K.467), the Pro Musica Orchester Wien & Paul Angerer (k. 449), the Wiener Volksoperorchester with Peter Maag (K.451, K.488, K.491, K.537). In each of these recordings (none of which have been remastered to date) Klien shines, but the B-grade orchestras sound sour and rough. Whether that is more a function of poor engineering than the artistic shortcomings of the ensembles, we cannot know. Either way, it is a shame - considering Klien's immense talent - that these recordings sound as rough and harsh as they do.

Thankfully, we at least have this disc, the only Mozart Concerto performances featuring Klien in which the orchestra and sound engineering rise to the occasion. In K.453, SS leads the Minnesotans in spirited readings of the outer movements, and the Andante is full of such exquisite beauty and refinement that it qualifies as a ""postcard from Cythera"" (as reviewer BO'H would say!). Klien's playing of the Andante cadenza is deeply contemplative - and on his Bosendorfer, we get to luxuriate in those deep bass notes. SS's crisply articulated Rondo is a joy - both Klien and the ensemble impart a sparkling vitality to the Presto interlude at 5:20. This Presto interlude is one of Mozart's best surprises, and a archetypal example of what makes Mozart Mozart. Overall, there is an abundance of energy in play here, and happily, a lot of it is supplied by the Minnesotans.

K.595 has long been a subject of debate. Today's musicologists sneer at the notion that Mozart intended it as a farewell; accordingly, the HIP movement usually deprives their readings of this concerto of any sense of valediction. While the musicologists may be right, the HIP practitioners are surely wrong to play K.595 prosaically.

Whether Mozart realized it or not, the Bb Concerto he completed on January 14, 1791 is indeed his farewell to the genre. Alfred Einstein argued passionately that Mozart seemed to have a premonition about his fate; while we may never know if this is really true, the music itself tells us that Einstein may have been right after all.

Right from the start, the cellos and basses underline the Allegro with a sense of gravity. The happy tunes that follow are thus tinged with sadness - the sun is shining, but for the last time - and this signals that Klien and the Minnesotans see K.595 as more than just another item in the Koechel catologue, its status as the final piano concerto being something more than mere coincidence.

Any doubt one might have about the valedictory nature of this work is removed in the Larghetto - a vision of eternity - and Klien and the Minnesotans play it with a wistfulness that makes the heart ache. The Rondo, playful and childlike - a longing for the days of innocence - is sweet, charming, innocent, and sad. Arthur Hutchings wrote that ""the sun never sets on any of Mozart's four piano concertos in Bb"" - this is undoubtedly true, but in K.595, twilight is nigh.

This pairing is serendipitous. The sound is good, and the performances are brilliant. Marvel at the miracle of 1784. For 62 enchanted days, time let Mozart ""hail and climb / Golden in the heydays of his eyes...""

""... And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
Trail with daisies and barley
Down the rivers of the windfall light.""

"Guitar plays in the background...Not cool at all. Lovely song, but someone gets really weird with an electric guitar in the back ground before the first chorus. Discordant. Made my nephew cry. Not at all what I purchased that for.",0

"Fresh but faithful Gotta love the creative but simple chord progressions (I mean, how often do you hear major seven chords in pop music?), the fantastic melody, and the inspiring lyrics. I'm glad Weezer and Hayley didn't change much about this song, because it was perfect as is. They certainly did it justice.",1
"Children's selection This was selected as the entry song for a class of Headstart students' graduation ceremony.  The children loved it, but some parents had doubts about possible double entendre.

Oh well, things happen.
Exchanged it that night and tried again today.  This one doesn't work either.  I tried 3 players!  No luck.
And worse, the person who got it as a gift...well, she's having the same problem.
Did I get unlucky enough to get the only 3 that don't play?  I doubt it.
Poor quality run.

"muppets??? not the way I know them It's too bad some so-called singers had to insist on covering these great songs; they were much better in the original and some things are so good the first time, no one should go adding their own two cents worth to that for their own personal profit and 'fame'.  This is definitely no improvement or enhancement of the muppets original show recordings; leave well enough alone!",0
"""She made a monkey out of old King Kong..."" This is an album of classic Muppet songs covered by modern artists.  It includes favorites like ""Rainbow Connection"" and ""Movin' Right Along"" from THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979), but my favorite track, hands-down, is Matt Nathanson's ""I Hope That Something Better Comes Along"".

Other highlights include ""I'm Going To Go Back There Someday"" by Rachael Yamagata, ""Bein' Green"" by Andrew Bird, ""Our World"" by My Morning Jacket, and Sondre Lerche's fun ""Mr. Bassman"".

OK Go perform the ""Muppet Show Theme"" in their off-kilter style.  Weezer and Paramore's Hayley Williams put an alternative/punk spin on the uplifting ""Rainbow Connection"".  ""Mahna Mahna"" is pretty much a straight cover of the Muppet original, with very little interpretation by The Fray.

The more I listen to this album, the more I warm up to it.  I love the Muppets and am familiar with most of these songs.  Most of the covers stay true to the original Muppet versions and make for enjoyable listening (though I found ""Night Life"" by Brandon Saller of Atreyu and Billy Martin of Good Charlotte to be too heavy for this collection).  This tribute album hits its highs with the various ballads, in my opinion.  The final three tracks are an excellent block of music to close out the album.

""I Hope That Something Better Comes Along"" was a comical lovesick ditty sung in THE MUPPET MOVIE by Kermit and Rowlf.  Nathanson sings it softly with piano accompaniment.  It's such a beautiful tune, you forget he's singing about dogs and frogs.

I think any Muppet enthusiast should give this tribute album a try.  At least listen to the MP3 samples.  There are some fan-favorite songs and some interesting interpretations.  And the interesting mix of contemporary artists might allow listeners to get acquainted with acts they hadn't really heard before.",1

What I was hoping for was an anthology of all of those hard to find singles and B-sides that are now going for astronomical prices.  Dieter, Boris, how about it?  I skipped buying this compilation, but would step up for a box of all of your past singles in their complete glory. Particularly those gems like ""She's Got A Gun"", ""Lost Again"" and others that contain songs or versions of songs that have never been released on CD.  Let's do it!",0

"Sloppy and boring effort from an otherwise dope emcee My man Dom Pachino is maad nice, and son's skills have only increased since Killarmy's first joint 'Silent Weapons'. (If you hear Dom on 'Silent Weapons' and listen to him on later albums and projects, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) I've also been really impressed by Pachino's newer solo joints (go and copp that 'Unreleased' joint) on his Napalm Recordings imprint, which is nice because now fans get to hear Pachino spit 100% rather than passing the mic to his compadres. Hands down, Dom Pachino is one of my favorite emcees, PERIOD.

However, I heard this and was heavily disappointed and let down. If you listen to all of his solo projects since the last Killarmy album, PR sounds like he's pumped full of vigorous energy, spittin venomous darts all around the tracks. This one '4 Security Reasons' sounds lazy, tired, boring, lethargic, monotonous, uninspired, and overall a below average performance from the PRT.

Whoever was enlisted for production provided some really tired samples that were sloppily chopped up. On top of that, the beats are all under about 120 bpm except for a fast song (track 3, ""Gunz Out"")with some sloppy drum programming. Even Dom's darts are terribly boring as are those from the lesser known Wu-affiliates (like Crunch Lo from Cappadonn'a group Othorized F.A.M.), which is one reason why so much of the extended Wu fam is unknown: most of them aren't worth listening to. I hope this 'Security' project is not a downward spiral into the descent of wackness for Dom. Only time will tell.

But if you want some hot Dom ish, check out 'Unreleased', 'Domination' (which is really hard to find), or almost anything under his Napalm recording label.",0

"Sourced from Digital Jazz Reviews Pear  Extemp'ore PSCD 2011
RELEASE DATE 5/24/2011

Rick Milne - Percussion

Nick Pierone - Keyboards

Every fiber of my being tells me that I should really hate this release...I rarely listen to others so why should I pay much attention to myself. I would be wrong.

Pushing musical boundaries all while innovative, evocative and with an incredible sonic depth of field. The debut from Pear opens the musical senses but asks you to do but one thing.

Listen.

The amount of time, thought and creative energy put into this release must be mind boggling. A musical frame of reference would be later more experimental Miles Davis meets Brian Eno. Welcome to the land of rhythm and groove.

Improvisation. Being in the musical moment is the celebration that is ""Extempore."" One special guest that gives a phenomenal performance is bassist Jennifer Leitham. This is truly a release that will give up something new of itself with each spin of the disc. ""Subtle nuances"" prevail whether the Miles Davis sampled spoken word intro to ""Dewey Miles"" or the rapper Cindy Wonderful this may be the finest example of a free jazz recording session to date.

Creativity abounds, avant garde but accessible; a sonic color pallet for the mind",1

The vocals are very amateur and the singer has no range or depth. Needs singing lessons for like 5 years before she should release another song. Don't buy this tripe, save your money for some real music. Even if you are a die-hard Gorga fan, stop the madness! At least with Tardy for the Party it was a catchy tune. This is just total garbage. I wouldn't listen to this again even if you paid me to do so!",0
"Seriously awful I love finding new music.  After hearing this person sing, I want my hearing back!  I hope she has a real job. Awful tone and tune.",0
Really.....this chick thinks she can sing? If this song were selling for a nickel it would be too much money. Unbelievably mundane....really sucks! not worth buying.  She's just a tabloid TV wannabeewho  thinks she's hot.  She auto invest in a hair transplant.,0
"What happened?? This is the first Hawthorne Heights album that I can't even LISTEN to. They veered so far off of their path that I think they might not be able to find it again. Change is good in a band, but THIS much change is too much, except for the first and MAYBE second album after losing a member (either to death or just leaving the band).

This honestly just kind of sucks.",0
"Uniquely moving tripped-out prog-folk that deserves to be heard I may be over a year late with this review, but I believe someone needs to share just how excellent this album is--especially for psych-rock aficionados--so better late than never. While Tim Cohen's other band, The Fresh & Onlys, are a little more well-known, I believe his work under the name Magic Trick is more timeless. Whereas the former specialize in up-tempo, 60s-ish (now 80s-ish) jangle psych, and to great effect, Magic Trick's music here is truly original, and almost defies categorization.

'The Glad Birth of Love' contains elements of folk, old-school blues, Indian music, Syd Barrett-style psych, and prog, resulting in a sound that not only is unique, but when combined with the surrealistic, soul-stirring lyrics and heartfelt vocals, is very moving as well, and makes for an extremely absorbing listening experience. The four songs here average over 10 minutes apiece, making this album perfect for late-night headphone journeys. Throughout, you'll hear reverb-soaked acoustic finger-picking, gorgeous boy-girl harmonies, hypnotic drones, and stellar dream-like melodies, with a hazy atmospheric sheen over everything that gives these songs an eerie, mystical sound that seems way off in the distance while tickling your brain at the same time.

If you're a fan of The Fresh & Onlys, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, even though it is entirely different. But there's no denying just-plain great-songwriting. The closest comparison I could make would be the rootsy post-rock of early 2000's Califone mixed with the dreamy folk-pop of Skygreen Leopards, but weirder and more progressive. It'd probably be easiest, though, to just check out the free stream at Bandcamp and decide for yourself. If you're anything like me, it most likely won't be coming out of your rotation for a very long time.",1
Vince Pope Why doesn't he have his own Wikipedia page? His use of recurring tonal motifs is rad. I also like how the 30 album tracks are organized in alphabetical order and it somehow flows really well.,1
"Best. Song. Ever!! Everyone needs a song like this in his/her music library. Craig Hella Johnson composes magnificent works, like ""Requiem"" (brings me to tears every time), and ""Motherless Child"" is no exception. Beautiful-- can't stop listening!",1
Cute! Very fun version of this song.,1
"REHASHED COLLECTION Obviously, Nancy cannot release any new recordings since her untimely death, but these two ""new"" collections are recycled from previously released CDs.

"The truth The truth is that the review is of one star is a star too many. Trying to rebrand cow dung by calling it cow patties just is an attempt to hide the truth. It is still cow dung. That is how I feel about this song, artist, and the whole wannabe album. This song is horrible, the beat is okay, but the vocals are ghastly. There is no depth or range. It's a waste of time and money both on the consumers' end and on the part of everyone subjected to this. The only happy person is probably the audio engineer  that mixed this because he is laughing all the way to the bank for the hours he has logged in the studio trying to make this tripe radio worthy. The truth...is that this totally sucks.",0
"Make it stop Please...stop the madness! This song is horrible. So auto tuned it's ridiculous. If I wanted to hear a computer signing, I would use Garage Band. Its the same repetitive Lines over and over again. No range, no depth, no talent. Save your cents or spend it on someone with the actual ability to sing.",0
"OMG Please Not Another Singing HOUSEWIFE! The only thing that should be on display here is a refund ticket for any money you spent on this garbage. Seems we live in a society where bored housewives are so desperate for attention and fame, they will humiliate themselves to no end just to get attention. The mere fact that someone gave this girl a recording contract tells you the depth of how low this society is going. Any idiot off the street can now be a tv star wannabe or singer. The days of real talent are gone folks, welcome to the decline of society.",0
Robot This sounds like a robot is singing it.. This isn't music.. Auto tunes at its worst. I would not waste .89 for this.. It's garbage,0
I would not waste my money I would not waste the 89 cents for this song.  It is over processed electronically and horrible.  What company would want to bankroll this.  This is worse than Countess Luann's song.,0
"Is This A Joke? It must be a joke on the music buying public to actually charge for this so-called music.  This chick couldn't sing her way out of a kid's birthday party.  Nothing but over-processed, heavily synthesized, trite, electronica garbage.  While the cream still rises to the top with modern home recording technology, the downside is that we have to wade through a sea of human waste to get to it.  Melissa Gorga is a no talent hack who needs her troll of a husband's money to bankroll this mess because NO ONE ELSE WILL.  Ridiculous.",0
"When You Wish Upon A Star This is not the best of Disney. In fact it doesn't sound like Disney music at all.

"Back on the shelf Ugh. If half star was an option, that is what this deserves. It's not catchy, it's asinine...kinda like audio cyanide. Not being a hater, but this song is horrible. The person that gave it 5 stars must be deaf. Stone deaf. No talent whatsoever. No range, can't hold a note for more than a second. No lung capacity. No depth. Very choppy, which means she couldn't sing the whole thing all the way through. Every single song on this album is horrible. The songwriter that wrote this probably wishes they had never given Gorga this song to sing. They probably wish they had given it to anyone else...perhaps even her cousin. If anyone else had sung it, this song would have had more traction and be 10x better. This is terribly sung, and i want a refund. she probably sounds great in the shower...but don't we all? That doesn't mean you need to be ""On Display""",0

"Loved it xx Im giving this a four because i haven't heard the whole album. But these are the songs i loved - definately worth hearing:

1. Maybe = This is a beautiful song. Its a love song for this generation about a guy who likes this girl and he isn't sure if she feels the same and he sits around waiting for her to text him/sign on etc. Its reaaally sweet, the music is beautiful, the words aren't typical what you hear in love songs and jay sean sounds the best hes ever sounded. Its got a little guitar solo that everyone will love towards the end

2. Stay = The lyrics in this song and the chorus are fantastic. I love how he drags on the word ""stay"" in the chorus. Its about a guy and his girl who always argue and basically he says he knows he treats her bad but he wants her to stay. The remix of this is hot as well.

3. Tonight = This song kinda reminds me of Neyo ""Closer"" but its also its own thing. Jay sings about a girl who catches his eye at the club and hes saying he aint lettin her go home tonight.. its a hot track

4. Ride it = I didn't like this song at first but it grows on you.. listen to it a few times its a pretty nice song.

Thats all ive heard but i think it would be worth getting the album. Jay sean has talent we've seen that from his last album. Check out the songs ive listed, im sure you'll love it.

Murder is an awesome song as well. It features a girl name Thara who sings it well with Jay. And Used to Love her is pretty good too.",1
"Jay Sean's Crooning All English Album SSLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

annoyingly so.  I can't stand it compared to his old stuff remixed with awesome punjabi beats.  These songs are whiny and very late tween love.  yuck!  I'm disappointed I bought the CD at all.",0

BASS! The bass line is wonderful.  Such a great and danceable track.,1
Totally destroyed the original beautiful song The pianist only showed how great he is with improvising that does not match with the original theme of the song. It does not make good music if you just keep adding licks without understanding how they go with the song.,0
Mea Culpa I gave it five because it deserves five. ENIGMA is an amazing group. All of their music is great and I will be collecting all of their stuff.,1
Great song! This is a great song - the video is very cool as well (stop motion). Highly recommend this song and his other works as well.,1

"NOT Generic Pop! I was introduced to Matt's music when someone sent me the 'WTF' video and kinda dismissed him as a generic 'gay' artist, i.e. high energy songs. This album is actually very different to that preconception. It's proper, adult pop music, almost MOR in parts, but works well. The highpoint is the title track where Matt's amazing voice carries you through every emotion of the song.
This is great, well sung, well produced music and Mr. Zarley deserves all the success coming his way.",1
Great song Great song,1
"A great reminder of our dependence. Man, laying down those troubles can be tough, for me at least. ""No, it's all good, I got this Lord"" is a phrase that flows all too often from my stubborn self.

"Holding Breath There is no question that Nicole Scherzinger from The Pussycat Dolls fame has had some ups and down away from being a Pussy Cat. One of them was last year as winner of Dancing With The Stars. But musically, she hasn't really shown that she could sing more than she could chew. Her latest song Don't Hold Your Breath isn't really a song that feels exciting or well-displayed. She doesn't do enough to show that she can fully be seperated from her pussycat dolls days, and be taken more assertively as a solo act in the ways others' like Beyonce' have thrived. Nicole really needs to get something out to make it more of a ""wow factor."" She said she will have something out soon, but honestly what she has shown is more of a snoozefest that makes it worth holding your breath.

Makyo  Yashini. This disc is very interesting the music being different from the norm. Makyo has written a collection of songs that are to my ears very pleasing.

"The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen. Although Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh, it is the lesser known The Way of Peace (1907) which reflects more accurately his New Thought Movement affiliations, referencing as it does Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism. The book is essentially a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity'. Whatever we meditate upon, Allen explains, we become. If you meditate upon ' that which is selfish and debasing, you will ultimately become selfish and debased'. Whereas if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become pure and unselfish'. It is now in the public domain within the United States and most other countries. It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition. The book consists of 7 chapters: The Power Of Meditation; The Two Masters, Self And Truth; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power; The Realisation of Selfless Love; Entering into the Infinite; Saints, Sages, And Saviors, The Law Of Service; and The Realisation of Perfect Peace. The first chapter also contains a poem, Star of Wisdom, which captures the essence of the book.",1
"Yay! Kick it Up a Notch is Awesome! Slash's tone is awesome!

The Slash-man's heyday was 20 years ago with Axl Rose / Guns N' Roses. His post-GN'R output has been somewhat disappointing, but this song delivers!

Slash's tone is killer, his guitar is way up in front of the mix (read: loud), his chunky riffs are killer, and his leads / solos are truly inspired.

Yes, this is a kids song, but for 99 - it's a worthwhile addition to your collection.

Slash is a great session player. My other favorite Slash track from the last 10 years is his work on Daughtry's ""What I Want."" It also has that sleazy guitar tone that made Slash a legend.

Where's Perry?",1
"Compared to the Rolling Stones or Skynyrd? NOT!!! More like Tom Petty meets your typical flavor of the day post 90s poppy commercial rock. Looking at the guys on the cover you would swear they just got done playing a biker bar, but the tunes are radio aimed all the way. There are a few decent riffs here and there for certain, but the problem is that they all fall flat on their face as they just plain try too hard to be catchy. You gotta groove hard and strong IMO and these tunes just DON'T. The sad thing here is that the vocals and guitar are of an obvious very high caliber. One of two things happened with American Bang. Either (a), they were led around by a nose ring via a lame producer that was over concerned with ""hooks"", or (b)as a group they put all their eggs in the commercial radio basket. Either way, it's weak and typical commercial rock. BTW, what the heck are people comparing this to classic Stones or Skynyrd for??? There is NOTHING here even remotely close. That much is hype to be sure.",0
"anemic pop drivel Lame is the best way for me to describe this cd.  The tunes are along the lines of something I would expect to here on any commercial fm ""alternative "" radio station.  Vocal heavy and downright boring this band really brings nothing new to the table.  Unless you like pop heavy music or like to be able to hum along with every song, then run, don't walk from this cd.  I have the feeling this is an ""either you love it or you hate it cd.""  I hated it.",0
"Far Away From A True Rock Band! I have been reading all the reviews from this band and I Am not sure if my copy was from some kind of mistake recorded with another band material.
This band is so far away from true solid rock that I do not need too much time to explain why.
They only have one song, the opening one ""Whiskey Walk"" that you can call serious Solid Rock, the rest of the album is commercial, soft, fluffy or whatever other superficial adjective or word, phrase for naming an atribute.
They have nothing in common to Lynyrd Skynyrd or Guns N' Roses, there is no Southern Rock in their music, if you want to get a new Southern Rock band check Dirty Sweet, or if you want some Guns N' Roses style check New Device but please be honest, you can like this band or not but do not compare it to any Classic Rock Band!",0

"British Vocal Sensation performs lesser-known standards Some thirteen years ago, I was knocked out by the vocal expertise of this young, fedora-clad gentleman when I heard him sing with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra (NYJO) during a trip to London.  On this 2009 album, on which he performs lesser-known standards to the accompaniment of a superb jazz trio (along with tenor sax, fluegelhorn, and cello soloists), Atila has matured into a first-rate song stylist, influenced primarily by the late Mel Torme, with whom he shares a velvety voice and impeccable musicality.  For me, the CD's dual apices are two classics associated with Frank Sinatra which deserve far greater recognition:  ""You, My Love"" and ""Nancy (With the Laughing Face)"", both composed by Sinatra's lifelong pal Jimmy Van Heusen (Mack Gordon supplied the lyrics for ""You, My Love"", while comic Phil Silvers, who was an early Sinatra sidekick, penned the words to ""Nancy"", which was dedicated ""The Voice's"" then-baby daughter) and interpreted most sensitively by Atila.  He rounds out the recording with selections from Richard Rodgers (in collaborations with both Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, whose lyrics adorn the title track), George and Ira Gershwin, Italy's Riz Ortolani, Johnny Mandel, and Brazil's Dori Caymmi, applying his vocal gloss across the board.  Atila is a most welcome addition to the pantheon of male vocal giants.",1

"Thousand Foot Krutch Is Amazing! 'Wow' is all I can say about some of this amazing artist's songs! Very original, artistic, and written so well. The lyrics are great, the music is amazing, and his voice is the best I've ever heard. This song, Favorite Disease, is one of my favorites of the more tame songs from TFK. A must-have for every TFK fan, if you ask me!",1
"Beautiful. Amazing. Unique. BUY THIS SONG This song is very unique, and everyone may not like this type of song...I don't know. I do; especially given that fact that Thousand Foot Krutch made and sings it.

It is about drug addicts, I do believe. The singer is saying that ""every time I hear you say I just need one, to take this pain away/
you're a broken wing, not a broken thing, you can heal in time, if you try, it'll be okay, you can walk away, sweet Juliana..."" and that he wishes he can take the pain away, to make it all seem safe.

In the bridge, he says: ""and I won't laugh, I won't look, I won't listen if you just get up/ and I won't laugh, I won't
look, I won't listen if you just stand..."" and I like that, because that is exactly what people who need to stop something (from a bad habit to drugs or whatever) need to hear, that somebody cares and won't laugh at them trying, won't laugh if they fail again.

Which can be used as either God saying that, or a loved one, either works, I think. Or if the person listening to the song has no one, then it's the singer telling them.

It's really a beautiful song. I recommend it 110%.",1

It started skipping by the second song and skipped the entire CD. I took it out and looked at it and sure enough there was a HUGE scratch on the back which is probably why it would not play right.

"There's better competition out there Pros:
- Nothing

Cons:
- Sloppy playing by the Philharmonia Orchestra;  late and early entrances one after another and muddy sonics ruin the performance. It seems like Michael Tilson Thomas was in a big rush and had very little time to rehearse the piece.

Additional comments: Somehow I expected more from Michael Tilsom Thomas and the Philharmonia Orchestra; they really don't offer anything new to the table. For outstanding performances, look for Fritz Reiner's 1960 recording of the excerpts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Antal Dorati's recording with the Concertgebouworkest, and Gergiev's recording with the Kirov Orchestra (now the Mariinsky Theater Symphony Orchestra). But keep in mind that Reiner's reading is approached as symphonic concert, so expect quick an quirky tempos. On the other hand, Dorati's reading is a lot more sterile and steady. All in all, Reiner and Dorati's readings are performed with such precision it makes Tilson Thomas's recording sound like a High School Band. It's a pity, because Tilson Thomas has some magnificent recordings out there (Beethoven's Late Choral Works with the London Symphony Orchestra), but this just isn't one of them.

If you're looking for a more recent recording, I strongly suggest Sir Simon Rattle's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic. All in all, avoid Tilson Thomas's recording, there's just way more and better competition out there by better orchestras.",0
Awesome!! Better than I imagined Awesome!!  Better than I imagined.,1
"A rare Cambodian treasure This is a great album. It is unlike anything else you're likely to hear, in a good way. Upbeat, light-hearted and free, it is 60's-style swinging rock with high, distinct vocals. And the song titles are hilarious. These songs combine western rock with what I assume is traditional Cambodian sounds, and they do it beautifully. It is so sad that this entire generation of talented musicians was murdered during the Khmer Rouge.

Listening to this album makes me wonder what Cambodia was like before the Khmer Rouge; it's sort of a glimpse into a lost culture. But beyond all that, it's good music and we're lucky that it survived. Thanks for all the effort that went into making it available online.",1

"From MainlyPiano ""Your Last Smile"" is the debut album from Iranian composer/pianist Behdad Bahrami, and what an incredible debut it is! The twelve original piano solos are tinged with melancholy and blend classical, new age, and pop elements into a soulful, meaningful listening experience that gives a glimpse into the soul of a very passionate and poetic young man. It is also a reminder of what a powerful and universal language music is and that although we might not understand each other's words, speaking from the heart with music will always be understood.

""Your Last Smile"" begins with ""The Light On the Balcony,"" a piece that conveys warm contentment with an easy grace and gentle touch. ""Secret Whispers"" is gorgeous. A bit more classical in style, the haunting and slowly flowing melody creates a pensive, dreamy mood. ""Voice of the Rain"" is one of my favorites. It occurs to me that if Chopin were alive today, he might compose something like this. I also really love ""Cold Steps,"" a dark, very introspective piece that comes from deep within, expressing a profound sadness that takes your breath away. ""Melody of Autumn"" is much lighter and has a  swirling energy. ""Nobody Knows"" is a lovely ballad that seems to be telling a story - perhaps a shared secret. ""The Last Smile of You"" conveys the feeling of tragic loss. Mournfully sad yet elegant and graceful, this is another favorite. ""The Cafe at 25 O'Clock"" is quite different from the other tracks, with jazz chords and playful keyboard runs that show another side of this gifted artist. ""End of a Dream"" ends the album with a light-hearted waltz that dances around the piano with its charming melody and then ends abruptly at just the right moment.

Behdad Bahrami is a really impressive new artist who just might be on the brink of an international music career. Highly recommended!",1
"A delight from start to finish My sole regret is not being present at Washington's Blues Alley when they laid (lain?) these tracks down on a cold January night in 2010.  What an absolute delight of swinging, inventive and nourishing big-band music this is!

While each cut is of interest, I'll single out ""Not on the Bus"", written by MSG Matt Niess, a tour-de-force mini-suite that name-checks both Nat and Miles and generates palpable suspense and excitement with some transitioning flat-5ths before settling down in a nice modal groove.  Excellent!

Then there's ""Barbara"", Horace Silver's waltz by way of ""My Favorite Things"".  Arranger MSG Jim Roberts, the band's guitarist, betrays an impressive harmonic palette as he investigates the full measure of the tune.  This guy can write!  Sopranoist SSG Antonio Orta, takes a nice, evocative solo along the way.

Too many other treasures here to mention. My gosh, the attending audience must have had a wonderful evening of music that night!

"Great band, horrible album. As a longtime Tub Ring fan, it pains me to give them a bad review, but the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 star is my love of the band and the 4 songs that I think are listenable on it: #03 Cg Vs. Tr - I Shot Your Faggot Horse Bitch (Old School Mix), #04 Here Come Da Fuzz, #07 Goldfinger (Funkfinger Mix), and #11 Here Is Come Is Da Fuzz Dizzle - S8 Rob Kleiner Remix.

The rest of the album is basically just bad noise remixes.  Even on a song like #13 The Day the World Will End (Private Apocalypse Mix F. Aesop Rock)mindcuffed that I wanted to enjoy if only for Aesop Rock, he's so low in the mix you can barely make any of it out.

However, what I can recommend are the previous albums by Tub Ring, namely 'Secret Handshakes' and 'Fermi Paradox'.  Basically, anything 'Drake Equation' and forward is amazing.",0
Keep the party going Tub Ring's Secret Handshakes album (easily their best) spawned this remix album.  So here's a bunch of tunes that aren't quite as cool as their original interpretations... but the point in owning this album - when you're all out of Tub Ring... this record keeps the party going!,1

"More great music from Mozart by a great performer Vassily Primakov (born 1979 in Moscow, Russia) is an award-winning Russian concert pianist and recording artist known for his interpretations of Chopin.

Primakov began studies at Moscow's Central Special Music School at age eleven as a pupil of Vera Gornostayeva. He then attended the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara and the Juilliard School in New York, where he studied under Jerome Lowenthal.

In 1999 Primakov won second prize at the Cleveland International Piano Competition, and in 2001 he was a semi-finalist in the Van Cliburn Competition. Upon hearing Primakov's performance of ""La Valse"" at the competition, Van Cliburn himself said ""Prodigious technique, really wonderful,"" with a ""look of sheer rapture on his face."" Primakov then won both the Silver Medal and Audience Prize at the 2002 Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition. In 2007 he was honored by the Classical Recording Foundation with their Young Artist of the Year Award. His disc of 21 Mazurkas by Chopin was named a ""Best of Year"" by National Public Radio (2009). In 2011, along with his duo partner Natalia Lavrova, Mr. Primakov launched a new Record Label LP Classics.",1

"Singer-songwriter Polache got his start pointing out the beauty of his home country. Singer-songwriter Polache got his start with a rousing anthem urging Hondurans to take pride in their nation, Polache is the stage name of 32-year-old Paul Hughes. The moniker combines his first name with the Spanish pronunciation of the initial letter of his last name.

Born to an English father and a Honduran mother, Polache began playing guitar when he was 9. But he didn't think he could make a living as a musician so, after university, he took a job with an ad agency in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Corts.

There, Polache was chosen to compose the music for an ad campaign promoting Honduras and the result, ""Mira a Honduras"" or ""Look at Honduras,"" became a surprise hit. In the song, Polache points out that besides political corruption, gang wars and poverty, Honduras is home to great natural beauty and honest, hardworking people.

""This is a country with low self-esteem,"" Polache said. ""I wanted to write a song that said: Even if we have thousands of problems, we have many good things that need to be recognized.""

The success of ""Mira a Honduras"" led to a television program in which Polache traveled the backroads, strumming his guitar and singing with the locals -- like an old-fashioned troubadour.

[...]

Polache grew up listening to U.S. and British pop music. But he later came to believe that too many Honduran tastes -- from fast food to popular music -- were imported. ""My music tries to promote all that's catracho,"" he said, using a slang term for Honduran.

For many years he chased that dream playing with one of the nation's biggest teams : Motagua. Failing to obtain success he called it a day and decided to start a career in the advertisement industry. He created numerous jingles for commercial products. His breakthrough as an artist came while working on a Honduran Tourism campaign, which needed a song to go along with the advertisement. Polache submitted ""Mira a Honduras"". The song was selected.  At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show ""De Troba con Polache"", in which he visited various places in Honduras.

At some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya. When the coup happened in June 2009, Polache was one of the few Honduran artists to strongly oppose. He called himself apolitical but said he was a friend of president Zelaya.

Polache's music has been a great success thanks to the things he sings about : from everyday social problems to one of Honduras' main passions : football. He tends to write his songs in a very special way, using as much Honduran words and expressions as possible.",1

"WHAT THE . . . This is an early April Fool's Day joke, right? This is one of - if not the - worst pieces of crap I've ever heard. Amazon, you should be ashamed. If you are going to offer up this garbage - even for free - you should come up with a rating system that includes negative stars (although 5 negative stars would be too kind). One would have to be a real masochist to download this nonsense. C'mon guys why not pull this from your catalog and spare others the auditory pain of even previewing it.",0
Just Plain Bad I can understand why this was previously unreleased. This has got to be one of the worst attempts at music I have ever heard!,0
"His mouth is at the mic, the guitar amp is in the bathroom Solemn, lo-fi, acoustic strummed, bummer of a song.  The mood of this song just does not match that it is Labor Day Weekend.  It is ironic in that the singer beckons you to go out and frolic in the sun and sea (because they won't make you cry) but his attitude leaves you to believe that he will just go out and flop on the ground sobbing while he achieves a severe sunburn.  Some singer/song-writers' best work really only shines when someone else performs it and that could be the case here.

On a side note:  This review is for this one song.  It bears no reflection on the artist's past body of work.  If David Gilmour had a FSotD and I didn't like it I would give it a low rating.  That low rating would have zero indication on how much I love a good bit of Pink Floyd.",0
Still has laughter in the background I really like this song and wanted a version without the audience laughing in the background. The laughter is louder than the singers sometimes and prevents me from properly enjoying the recording. Please have a version without the background noise!,0
I Really Like This Album This is a very well made album and the songs are amazing. I'm a fan of electronica and its refreshing to listen to an artist in the genre who doesn't sound like Skrillex or any of that crap. I'd say its part electronica and part rock but I can for sure tell that Joke is inspired by rock music. This is an outstanding album and I listen to it on a daily basis.,1

This track, which I purchased without preview, was not what I heard on the original vinyl. I assumed that since the cover art was identical, that the music would follow.

"ROCKIN' TOCCATA, BABY! If you love some rockin pipe organ music, this piece is for you!
It's not the well-known toccata like the Easter-time-favorite from Widor, but this lesser known one is equally fantastic!  In my opinion this one has more drama.  And may I add that my mother plays it brilliantly.  But since she does not have a CD on amazon.com, you need to buy this recording from Felix Hell.

I sampled several different recordings of this toccata on amazon.com.
And this is the one you need.
The others are too slow or lacking energy.

My only critique here is that the echo in this hall makes it hard to appreciate some of the faster passages in the piece.  But the energy is still there, and I recommend this recording!

Oh, and I'm still waiting for this guy to make a CD called ""Felix Plays the Hell Out of The Gloucester Cathedral Organ"".  Heehee.",1

"Poor Quality The CD's are of poor quality, there are skips in the play back and the sound quality is muffled and poor.",0
"The production is excellent and the musicianship (as expected) is also very good The alter-ego of Hevisaurus; Sauruxet is actually the same band, except with a different singer. This band was the result of a contractual disagreement between Hevisaurus and their record company, so the group went off and reformed under a different name and singer. Sauusplaneetta is the only album that Sauruxet ever released. The band apparently worked things out with their record company and returned to their old lineup and name.

The music is fairly similar to Hevisaurus, light-hearted Power Metal and Classic Metal sung in Finnish. The production is excellent and the musicianship (as expected) is also very good. Riffi Raffi has some excellent shredding leads and riffs throughout the cd. The songs actually sound more serious and more standard Metal than the Hevisaurus stuff that I have heard (which is goofier). Then again, I don't speak Finnish so I don't know how silly the lyrics are, they sound more serious than Hevisaurus though, lol!

Anyway, if you are a fan of Hevisaurus or just Scandinavian power metal in general, I highly recommend it! The download is also pretty cheap, though I foresee buying the hardcopy someday. ;-)",1

When there are still good collections of original hits, when it's really easy to buy any single song you remember, why would you pay for a bunch of cover songs by these folks? I don't know why, and to keep this album from showing up so high on the ""Avg. Customer Review"" list, I'm giving it this 1-star review as a caution to others.",0
"Extremely Engaging Book of Revelations by the Drums is an extremely good first track off of a phenomenal album.
If you're into Indie, this is a prime example; I like the weird way they structure their songs (theres not really any firm chords in any of their music, which by the way makes it extremely hard to play this music acoustically), along with the synth. I wouldn't really consider it electronic music at all, but it does have some elements from it. The lyrics are really rather good and catchy as well.
This track, Money, and Please Don't Leave are all terrific tracks if you want to sample their music first.",1

"3 stars for the music, 5 stars for the whole production First of all, I find @ Wikipedia two composers named Leo Smit.  One is this one, an American born in Philadelphia.  The other was a Dutch composer who, in 1943, became a victim of the Holocaust.  The poems by Emily Dickinson are wonderful, the songs less so, though the singing is exceptional and the composer is a superb pianist.  I am just not that fond of the music.  But you shoud buy this CD even if its just for the wonderful, delightful, charming, funny short essay Smit has written on the course of his life and the people he met, and a little something on what each of them contributed to what he became.  Just a sample, from the end of this essay, which goes about 3 lines past one full page: ""...Leonard Bernstein, who set a high  jump record while conducting the climax of my Second Symphony; Mary Goodwin and her friends from the Taos pueblo--singing, dancing, and drumming under the New Mexican night sky filled with infinity of cold, clear stars; and Emily Dickinson, who has been running my life for the past ten years and inspiring me to write songs to eighty-three of her stupendous poems.""  Along the way, he has unfailingly funny takes on Dmitri Kabalevsky, Isabella Vengerova , Nicolas Nabakov, George Balanchine, Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, British astronomer Fred Hoyle, and many others, not to mention the Chinese laundry over which his family lived at the beginning of his rich and productive life.",1

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Harry Flowers - Wyvern & Worm (Nouveau Tattva)
Harry Flowers is an Australian musician / singer-songwriter, who moved to Texas in 2004, recorded a series of hard-to-find EPs, before settling right here in Leicester. Harry Flowers, of course, was a character in the notorious 1968 Nicolas Roeg film, Performance, a strange, cruel little movie that's credited for signaling the end of the `60s alongside Altamont, the Manson Family murders, the demise of The Beatles and the inexplicable triumph of The Archies' ""Sugar Sugar"". Rum times indeed.

The irony is that ""Wyvern & Worm"" is doing its best to preserve many of the sounds of `60s, it's gentle psychedelic jangle will remind many of groups such as The Zombies and Traffic, right through to the more traditionalist recordings of XTC and Robyn Hitchcock. Fortunately, Flowers songs are ageless, impossible to truly pin down, and rather than wallow in clich, he writes songs that timelessly evoke an England, which hasn't altogether disappeared, but is certainly becoming harder to find. He then envelops them in soaring harmony and perfect pop arrangements.

""Wyvern & Worm"" won't bring Flowers international stardom and untold wealth, but it does mark the arrival of an artist eager to come to terms with new surroundings, new traditions and enduring music. The best material here happily stands alongside the classic recordings that have obviously influenced him. ""Pastoral Fantastic"" takes on early, baggy Blur and wins with a paisley flourish. ""Sad Light"" brings his antipodean roots to bear, and the Finn brothers are filtered through hazy sunshine psychedelia. ""Dawn Chorus"" greets the new day with Northern brass and a cheery disposition, and best of all, ""White Horse"", six minutes of mellow, intense narrative, accompanied by graceful strum and the impression of old Albion restored.",1
one of my favorite bands If you haven't bought this yet buy it now. Excellent band. Original sound. Not nearly appreciated as they should be.,1
"A fine rock and roll experience It goes without saying that Fanny were the premier female rock group of their time and I'd argue that their concise instrumental prowess and fresh intelligent songwriting put them a notch ahead of the average group of either gender. Why their rich musical legacy has been criminally unrecognised is incomprehensible to me but that might change if June and Jean Millington's 'Play like a Girl' gets heard as it harks back to Fanny at their best and shows where they are right now.

The title track is guarenteed to get the dead rise out of their graves and dance as it is played at an infectious energy level and is June Millington's opening feminist exhortation that you can do what you damn well want. I love Your Hair sharply references back to a previous era as a sixties woman in both senses of the term with lightning fast sharp observations. Jean's fine vocals and funk bass playing comes to the fore in let Love Linger with acid guitar lines. The softer side of the Millington sisters show up in  June's tender love song ""When You Bottom"" and the melodic ""Calling Your Name (To The Stars) I must pay tribute to Jean's son, Lee Madeloni as his fine drumming and percussion lends an incisive edge to the ensemble sound that is always there when needed. Jean's bass playing and singing makes a rock solid support as she always has done. The very worthy women musicians of the Institute of the Musical Arts get an airing in this project in ""One for Change,"" a great stomping rocker with gritty harmonisied chorus vocals and the contrasting modern R and B lead vocal stylings of Endless Lies, a syncopated rocker with lyrics that go way beyond what might appear an exhortation to a faithless lover to straighten up. June's prowess as electric slide guitar from way back of Terrible Things reaches further into the awesome 'Train's a coming' Son House country blues of 'Fall on You' with contrasting light dancing vocals.

This is the album where youthful enthusiasm and age and experience hold hands and this feels so like a review of Fanny's ""Fanny Hill"" album it is unbelievable and I urge those best able to see them in concert.",1
"If Only Everyone Could Play Like These WOMEN! To say that June and Jean Millington are a vital, albeit grossly overlooked, part of rock & roll history is a major understatement. As the co-founders of Fanny, the pioneering (and still, to this day, best!) all-female band, they, along with Suzi Quatro, set the stage for every other female rocker to come along over the next four decades.
 Over the years the duo have continued to work together, be it on June's three solo albums, as a duo (1978's LADIES ON THE STAGE and TICKET TO WONDERFUL from 1993) and with a new band, the Slammin' Babes (2000's MELTING POT).
 Now, more than a decade after the rather hit-and-miss MELTING POT, the sisters Millington return with PLAY LIKE A GIRL, arguably their best album since MOTHERS PRIDE, June's 1973 swan song with Fanny. While the disc isn't perfect (the production is a tad thin in spots, Jean Milington is woefully underused, students at June's Institute for the Musical Arts are used too much), it's pretty darn close. THIS is the album that many Fanny-atics have been waiting for!
 (On a side note, it's so cool to see so many women in their 60's still rockin' hard. Besides the Millington's, Quatro, Stevie Nicks and Deborah Harry ~ with Blondie~ have all released incredably strong albums this year, certainly among some of 2011's best).
 PLAY LIKE A GIRL kicks off with it's blistering title track. Full of garage-band energy and youthful swagger, this auto biographical tale is like ""Charity Ball"" all grown up! The sisters still have those killer harmonies that only siblings seem to be blessed with, while the instrumentation is taut and lively.
 In a just world, this would be a huge radio hit, but there are a couple of things that will prevent that from happening. First, there are the lyrics...songs about fishes surfing up stream just aren't in demand. Then there's the production ~ there are holes here that you could drive a semi through. By going for more of a live feel, June Millington and co-producer Lee Madeloni (Jean's exceptionally talented son) have kept things pretty bare-boned. By adding some keyboards, a little more percussion and some additional backing vocals, the track would have been much more fleshed out, resulting in a great cut vs. just a very good one. Still, one of my favorite tracks off the disc!
 Ditto ""I Love Your Hair!"" June Millington has rarely sung with such authority, attitude or animalistic passion. Growling the lyrics, she lets us know that she's been here since ""before the Gap/before Madonna/before rap"", and in that time, she's picked up a thing or two, resulting in a person she's happy with, both inside and out. Mark my word, this one IS ready to be a hit at urban, pop and A/C radio. Brilliant! (Special mention has to be made of Jean's amazing bass riffs...they anchor the song perfectly!).
 ""Let Love Linger"" has both it's pros and cons. On the up side, it features Jean's only (co) lead vocal. Still supple and sultry, her voice dances over the first verse's lyrics, caressing them in a velvety embrace. Why this woman doesn't take more leads ~ or do a solo album, for God's sake! ~ is beyond me!
 On the down side, the song just goes on waaaay too long. Since moving beyond Fanny, the Millington's have frequently had a tendency to get a bit 'jammy', resulting in tracks that could have ~ and should have! ~ been edited down. This is one such track. Still,very nice.
 ""When You Bottom"" is sheer pop perfection. With it's lilting arrangement, spirited lead vocal courtesy of June and the girl group backing vocals, this track is plain old fun, from start to finish.
 ""Apocalypse Deferred"" has a dark, prophetic quality to it that really works....I just wish that they had taken it further. The arrangement is urgent and edgy, while June's lead vocal is honest and knowing, but the young girl chorus just seems calculated and contrived. I would have much rather seen something chilly, strong and steely from Jean, along the lines of her bridge on ""Woman Who Sees The Signs"" from June's excellent 1983 solo album RUNNING.
 Throughout her career, June Millington has written some amazing ballads, including ""You've Got A Home"" from Fanny's 1972 masterpiece FANNY HILL and LADIES ON THE STAGE's ""Fantasy."" We can now add ""Calling Your Name (To The Stars)"" to that list. With it's atmospheric arrangement, delicate instrumentation and lovely lead vocal, this song is simply stunning. Nothing more need be said.
 ""Terrible Things"" has a wonderful bluesy vibe to it. Both tense AND relaxed, taut AND loose, June's guitar just talks to us here, even moreso than her lyrics. Yet another gem.
 ""Fall On You"" is a solid album cut, with a minimal, yet strong, arangement (once again, June's guitar just shines!) and a wise, soulful lead vocal.
 ""All For One"" is sweet enough, but we've heard June do a variant of this song on pretty much every album since '78. Nice....but necessary? I'm not sure.
 ""One For Change"" could have been a great rocker, but it's ultimately sunk by a number of miscalculations. First off, we once again have the production...this sounds like a demo tape. Second, the chorus...really amateurish and sloppy. Finally, the track just goes on WAY too long, repeating itself over and over. Yep, the seeds were there....they just never took root.
 And then there's ""Endless Lies'...I have a real issue with this cut. I'm all for June's work with IMA, but there's a time and a place for it, and it's not here. . I'm paying for a June and Jean Millington album, not a class project for Summer camp 2010. I WANT June and Jean Millington, especially when Jean Millington is already almost nowhere to be found (If we're being really honest here, why even call this a June and Jean Millington album? To cash in even more on the Fanny connection? Let's face it...this is basically a June Millington solo album). On top of all that, the lyrics are just dreadful...straight out of Intro to Poetry 101, or, even worse, some tweener's journal. A MAJOR misstep.
 Wrapping things up is the funky ""Opportunity Knocks."" I wish June had taken the time to build on this gem with another verse or a bridge ~ this is another good song that could have been fantastic.
 In summing things up, I just want to say how much I love both June and Jean Millington (and have for 40 years now!) and PLAY LIKE A GIRL, warts and all. Both the sisters and this album are vitally important to music, and I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next! I just hope A) it doesn't take another ten years, and B) Jean can be convinced to pick up a pen and step up to the mike a bit more! Until then...play on, ladies....play on! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).",1

"One Star Because Negative Isn't An Option! GAH! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! BLEEEECCCCCH!!!

Not good, not good, not good!!!!!!!!!!!

Rap is so awful in the first place, but to subject children to it through learning is atrocious! Our minds are altered by the frequencies of music & television, whether positively or negatively. This just made my shoulders meet my ears & cringe. I shut it off immediately. I would never purchase anything like this.

Let children be children & let them listen to REAL children's music, not noise pollution passed off under the pretense of being educational. I'm only 30, so my children are younger. I like musicians like Tom Chapin. His album ""Some Assembly Required"" is good.
Stop trying to make them grow up too fast by listening to imitations of the filth that adults listen to. When you have children that grow up listening to garbage music & television (ie: Nicki Minaj, ""Family Guy"" & the like), it programs their brains (television PROGRAMS) & creates chaos & confusion.
I don't think adults should listen to or watch that raunchy filth in the first place, but hey... the entertainment business banks on feeble minded people who wish to mindlessly numb themselves rather than enrich their lives.
 THEN people wonder why their child is a heathen, does poorly in school due to anger & frustration (frequencies), dresses like a thug or a street walker & won't listen to them. Temper tantrums are just uncontrolled & unguided bouts of anger. Most people anymore don't care to correct (PARENT), but temporarily mask it with a ""reward"", like junk food, electronics or letting them run wild because they don't want to deal with them. I call it Wal-Mart Kid Syndrome. That child then grows up to be a hedonistic, uneducated jerk of an adult with an undeserving air of entitlement & narcissism because it was never corrected.

In test after test of academic abilities, American students score last in comparison with students from the other twenty or so advanced countries. Imagine that!

Your thoughts, feelings & actions determine your future. It's called being responsible. We need to get back to the basics... desperately!

"The sound is not good Although the sound of this CD is not good (in fact, it is awful) what surprises me the most is the quality of the CD itself. Labels like ""Seeco"", ""West Side"" and many others are nowadays using CD-R to sell their products, which I consider a way of cheating the customer. CD-R like those produced by these labels I can find in my country at a very low price (let's say U.S.$1,0)and they are known as ""Pirate records"". Very sad this situation with these unconscious CD producers.",0

"Review from Gothic Paradise - www.gothicparadise.com Not too long since the release of Fantasynth and it's slightly more upbeat rhythms and fantasy themes, we're now treated with this work which delves into the more mysterious and legends based on celtic mythology, a theme very prevalent in gothic ethereal realms. It seems we're able to pick up where we left off with Mythomusic or The Garden with the dreamy mystical sounds on this album. The delicate layers of ambient music are presented across well over an hour in this fantasy world and eleven tracks for a nice full body of work.

The album starts off with a rich and dreamy mixture of ambient textures in ""Forest Heartbeat"" and also with the follow-up piece ""True Spirit of Nature"" for over fourteen minutes of beautiful, lush dreamscapes. At this point we're launched into a little more up-beat chill-out style with ""Samhain Ecstasy"" and even more of a harsher tone with some grinding guitars (still in a new age style) on ""Sancta Inquisitio"". This uptempo rhythm carries on somewhat further into ""Druids Trance"", appropriately named for it's trance-like rhythms and electronic loops. At this point we get to a definite favorite of mine in ""My Beloved Loneliness"", with a little more of a classical style with more organic sounding instruments taking the forefront over the interwoven tapestries of the melancholy backdrop. ""Ritual of Love"" follows in similar light with a little bit more of a ritual sound as the name implies with some percussion and various hypnotic rhythms and loops. ""Earth Prayer"" is another excellent ambient ethereal piece with angelic vocals gliding over the entrancing music as we drift along into the upbeat trance-like piece ""Beltane Moon"". The soaring synths and moving, but very New Age rhythms and beats move us into another sweet, dreamy track ""Bewitched by the Faeries"". This eight minute track drifts along slowly and hypnotically, setting the stage for eight-minute finale ""Wisdom of Trees"". Ambient, whispering tendrils gently carress the listener in this soft, dreamy piece with it's subtle, layered soundscapes providing a backdrop for a siren song, luring the listener in and holding them entranced and trapped for the duration as the album slowly and softly drifts to a close.

Over all the album is firmly rooted in the New Age style, something I've mentioned before we don't normally feature and review here on Gothic Paradise. However, there is just enough of the lush, ethereal and darker, dreamier ambient styles that take the listener into a beautiful dream-like fantasyland that has always caught my attention. As you listen to our ethereal radio show and a Psicodreamics track comes on, it just fits well within the hauntingly beautiful ambient realm, even with the touch of chill-out New Age styles. This album fits right in that mold as we drift from one piece to another, through the ebbing and flowing of the lush layers from smooth ambient synths to a little more pronounced styles and more upbeat rhythms. For fans of the softer ethereal and ambient soundscapes, this album is a great addition to any collection.

Rating: 4.5/5

There is unacceptable flutter in the recording which, as flutter does, shows itself in the woodwinds most of all. It's as if the tape has deteriorated.

"(4.5 stars)  AKB48s 23rd CD single is inspirational, touching and full of hope. AKB48 is back with their 23rd CD single ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" (which translates to ""The Wind is Blowing"") and features an upbeat, touching song with lyrics to help those who suffered from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and earthquake disaster.

Not long after the earthquake, several members of AKB48 had visited areas of devastation and as always, their goal to put a smile on everyone's faces, the group performed for families who were displaced and living in temporary shelters.

After their first tour, by the second visit to perform in front of families, a new song titled ""Kaze wa Futeiru"" had been created to help ease the pain of those who have suffered so much.  And also donating proceeds to the relief process.

Like other recent AKB48 CD singles, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE's, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" and ""Kimi no Senaka"" but comes with second C/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled ""Tsubomitachi"" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c/w songs.

And once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!

The version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are ""Kaze wa Futeiru"", ""Kimi no Senaka"", ""Gondola Lift"".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.

As for the CD single, ""Kaze wa Futeiru"" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How love and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.

My first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.

The second song ""Kimi no Senaka"" (which translates to ""Back to you"") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a fun song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite sad as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.

The third track is ""Gondola Lift"" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing ""Vamos"", while Yurigumi performed ""Gondola Lift"".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in love and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!

The three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.

As for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of five tracks.

The first music video is for ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.

The second music video is for ""Kimi no Senaka"" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it's happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.

The third music video is for ""Gondola Lift"" and this video is actually my favorite video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song beautiful and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking care of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.

The fourth music video is the ""DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"", so no mystical creature is featured.  It's all dancing!

And the final fifth music video is the ""Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen"" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.

Overall, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" is a wonderful and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their favorite performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru"" is an inspirational song but ""Gondola Lift"" was a fantastic and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.

But all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.

Once again, I'm pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, ""Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)"" is highly recommended!",1

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): The Chicago Kingsnakes - Blue Mosaic (MusicKing Records)
Their first proper album since 2003's ""Grass Roots"", though they've busied themselves over the intervening years touring the world with Byther Smith and playing shows with Junior Wells, Jimmy Witherspoon, Cash McCall, etc. When added to the fact that Kingsnakes leader, guitarist-vocalist James Anderson, has played with everyone from Buddy Guy and Albert King to Son Seals, James Cotton and Koko Taylor, It's probably safe to assume that The Chicago Kingsnakes are some of the best and most respected blues players around.

That's certainly the impression I get from listening to ""Blue Mosaic"". Their style, unsurprisingly, is Chicago blues, and they play it slow and heavy, and tight and upbeat, and whatever way they play it, they play it well. Opening number ""Take Your Time"" is measured and intense, and highlights all their strengths, primarily great musicianship. When they're aiming to get feet moving on tracks like ""Blues Gone Uptown"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson(esque) ""Lefty"" - the latter with harmonica courtesy of Nelson Keaton - they sound like the ultimate blues bar band. It's another track, ""So Cold in Chicago"", that I find myself returning to. Another upbeat number, it's what they used to call a toe-tapper, but it's a bit more than that, and seems to be stuck on repeat.",1

"LeAnn Sings With Feeling amazing voice, has an incredible ear for the correct note, able to sing with no accompaniment, and sings with feeling",1
"WARNING!  VERY LOUD...a DANGER to your Stereo Equipment! The main reason I gave it only 1 star...& loath it so much....is not the music.  The volume of this MP3 is SO much louder, than the rest of the songs I have on my flash drive, that I hope it didn't harm my speakers, on the system I just bought this month.  WHY??!!

WARNING...this MP3 could easily harm your stereo/speakers!  It is WAY too loud.  I would like a refund on this song!",0
Music This is a great song Marie Miller has a beautiful voice and a love for the Lord. Have referred her music to others.,1
Five Stars Great song Rodney!  Really shows the love of a father!!!  Love it!,1
"Delightful! I first heard this piece forty years ago and was immediately in love with it. It deserves to be much better known. Roger Roman, a pianist I have never heard of before, is a real find. He plays it with such verve and style and love. A very fine recording!",1
Maddi Jane VERY Beautiful voice. I luv this song soooo much. If u like this song by Bruno Mars try it by Madding Thx for supporting her ;),1
"Although it's a good bootleg, it's still a bootleg This is a Russian bootleg, and not the original print of this CD. Buyers BEWARE!! I bought this CD from this same seller a few weeks ago, and also have a copy of the REAL CD, and this is NOT REAL. It is a Russian bootleg that has been out for quite a while. Although it's a good bootleg, it's still a bootleg, so just beware you will only be buying it for the music, not for the rarity of the CD. If it's too good to be true, then it is!!",0
"Who's the new Romeo of Top 40 Music?  Def. not the jukes! Southside's ill-fated attempt at making Top 40 type songs.  But Southside is still Southside, whether singing blues & soul  (""Don't Look Back"" is a gem here) or sardonic pop songs, so it's still a worthy listen for fans.",1
Great voice. Great voice.,1
"The Nobility of the Fiske Jubilee Singers Mission Unfortunately some strange people have usurped William Warfield's vocal pcerformance. He was a U.S. Representative of the State Department to Africa, Asia, etc. And, he stressed such if you can sing--e.g. Spiriuals, you can sing Gospel; or, Bach. Nor, was finicky about how someone from a poorer background might respond to his singing. Whether a child to adult interrupted with ""Ohh"" or ""Awe,"" it was for him most important, that they be  given an opportunity to be exposed to something of beauty in their lives.",0
Five Stars great,1
"Will bring you to your knees I came across ""Better Days"" the song on a WOW CD I bought while in Houston. The song, the voice, the message had me intrigued---who is Robbie Seay (band)! I arrived back on my base and ordered Better Days [the album]. I fell in love with the voice, the lyrics, the melodies. Some of the tracks are slow, and full of ""God's Breathe"". My favorites are Better Days (I play it every morning while getting ready for work), Faith of Our Fathers, Eternal God, and my all time favorite ""Jesus, Garden of My Rest"". I have to say that Jesus, Garden of My Rest literally brought me down to my knees crying and praising our Lord. The songs have touched me like no other song has. Michael W. Smith comes pretty close however.
I am eagerly looking for more RSB albums, and will snatch them up as soon as they hit.

Thank you, Robbie, for helping me fall even deeper in love with Christ.

"not my thing The music stinks to me, but the dude does have a nice voice. I have to admit I don't like Contemprary Christian Music, just Jesus rock like REZ band or Glen Kyser blues Band.",0
"Five Stars First Of All it Was My favorite Song, Really Enjoyed Hearing It Again.",1
Awful with terrible production and mastering Another terrible mastering job. Clipped distorted mess. The mix is bad too. That aside the music Is also pretty bad. Sounds like the singer and band are on a different page. Not at all focused or tight. Maybe I am right and the band did the music then told a hired singer to put down whatever he felt like. Because that's as cohesive as it sounds. Awful sound makes it way worse. The first two Sabbat albums on vinyl are good. The remastered CD's sound really bad and this 3rd album is just plain BAD.,0
Five Stars The Priests have fine voices that bring peace and calm to the human spirit. Very nice,1
Missing tracks Full disclosure: this is not a review of the performance. I have not purchased this album. Be careful what you choose from the Amazon Music library because many of the albums listed merely identify the source of the few tracks they offer.,0
"Four Stars This is a very good R&B song from Roy ""C', he did it again. Very nice...",1
"Where's the rest?! Downloaded this for use in church service.  The information says this is 29 seconds long.  Not!  Even with the final reverberation it is at best 12-13 seconds.  Listening to the sample makes you think there is more, but what you hear on the sample is all you get.  Don't be fooled!",0
"FYI Tracks 23 and 24 are duplicates. This problem appears to exist on every service except iTunes. If you want this album, it may be better to download it from iTunes, despite the higher price. Alternatively, you could purchase it here and buy the faulty track (track 23) from iTunes as a replacement (if you don't mind mixing and matching MP3 and M4A formats).

Will change my rating once Cobra Entertainment addresses this issue.",0
It's One of my favorite songs from the early 60's It's One of my favorite songs from the early 60's. Love the movie also. Gene Pitney had a great voice. One of the best!,1
"love this song Love this song, I always buy my music here on amazon, the cloud player lets me take it anywhere, and I even have some purchases here from CD's I bought 7 years ago!! and the digital tracks just automatically updated to my amazon cloud player! awesome!",1
Pretty sure that this musician was taken along with everyone ... Pretty sure that this musician was taken along with everyone else.  He certainly doesn't deserve a bad review for her deviousness,0
One Star Just sickening!,0
Two Stars I prefer them to sing in spanish,0
not original Love the songs but they are not preformed by the original artists but they are okay I guess l l,0
Awesome I saw Meghan perform at Vidcon 2012 and was blown away. Her voice is amazing. Check out her videos on YouTube ... then buy the album.,1
Super chill Great song for just chillin' out and relaxing. Looking forward to more chill-out / downtempo music from JustMusique in the future!,1
"Perfect I use this and other Twinkle Twinkle... albums during rest time in my preschool classroom.  No annoying commercials from Pandora or iTunes radio anymore!  Added bonus, the eyes of adults in classroom during rest time light up when they decipher a song that is playing.",1
"One Star this song is not Leaving on the Morning Train, this is the wrong song.",0
Fun dance for children This song is extremely upbeat and fun for children to do motions along with the German lyrics.  If you google the title of the song there is a UK website that has a translation of the words.,1
"Otherworldly soundscape of sensitive splendor, beautiful colors, & delicate textures I hear wind chimes ... feel a cool breeze ... observe a vivid desert sunset ... experience a glorious sunrise ... see reflections on a glimmering lake's surface. The delicate and expressive ""chamber jazz"" of Pat Battstone (piano) and Richard Poole (vibraphone) will have you conjuring up many images of your own. As the two experienced musicians from Boston genially converse in an improvisational style, there are many musical moods created. Their second album release in less than a year, Battstone and Poole now feel that they have solidified their musical direction with additional maturity and an element of playfulness. They state, ""Mystery and suspense, call and response, have become more refined and our musical Voice has emerged."" I find their articulate expressions to be quite dreamlike and perfect for easy-listening or meditative contemplation.

Both jazz musicians display an affinity for the avant-garde, and they're carving personalized identities as an amalgamation of their personal influences. For pianist Pat Battstone, we hear a personality that seems to incorporate styles of Marilyn Crispell, Keith Jarrett, Bobo Stenson, Charlie Banacos and Bill Evans. As far as vibraphonists go, I hear elements of Teddy Charles and Gary Burton (whose ""Dreams So Real"" album might have been inspirational). Originally from Ohio, Battstone attended the Berklee College of Music in 1973. He's done a great deal of solo and ensemble work, as well as teaching, producing and recording. Battstone doesn't just play the piano's keys. He may pluck the strings to produce overtones, or he may employ hammers directly to the strings. At present, he also works as a rocket scientist at Draper Labs in Cambridge, Ma.

Richard Poole also has a long resume with many years as a professional musician.  He holds a Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition from Florida International University. Performance, production, a piano business and teaching have been his main focus over the years. He's helped many develop their own voice in music. Now, the two of them together are continuing to cultivate their own musical manifestations. Their kaleidoscope of magical sound is best described as an otherworldly soundscape of sensitive splendor, beautiful colors, and delicate textures.  (Joe Ross, Roots Music Report)",1
Five Stars Was on e of my favorite songs from the 50's. I also like the Shirelles,1
Five Stars love this song by these guys!,1
"Four Stars The wife loves this, helps her sleep.",1
"Waste of money I was not impressed with this windchime mix as it was too varied and sounds artificially looped. Check out David Sun's Wind Chime albumn. I was very much impressed with it and want to share it with all who are looking for slow, crisp, and clear windchime tracks.",0
Five Stars Completely satisfied,1
"Missed the Mark I usually love Darren Criss singing anything and Chris Colfer singing most things, but this duet just wasn't a good choice for them.  Nice try!",0
Not original artists I didn't notice at first that these songs were not done by the original artists.  It was a complete waste of money.,0
"comprehensive collection This collection is a bargain for a complete survey of Bartok's concerto output.  When you add the fact that the performers are among the best of one generation, and apt interpreters of this composer, you have a winning combination.  If you like Bartok, you will cherish this collection.",1
Five Stars Love the music,1
Five Stars OMG what a wonderful song. We all need help on our lifetime.,1
"Wow,  good tune Neat song",1
"Powerful new voices for a heart-gripping old tune The Homecoming Choir, the Nelons, & Guy Penrod combine to form a powerful new sound for a heart-gripping old song.",1
Soul Stirring This song will stir the soul. David Phelps voice is so beautiful it brings so much emotion to the wonderful words of this song.,1
Five Stars Love this song. It is like the writer knows me behind closed doors.,1
awesome song this song expresses the sentiment I feel and have never heard expressed in a song .... Amazing how the Lord answered my prayer through Jason's song ... Isn't the Lord amazing??,1
Five Stars INSPIRATIONAL!!!!!,1
Five Stars Love the message and really admire the singers,1
Love This Song Really like this song though wish there was a good shorter version that I didn't have to buy a whole album to get (read: WOW Lime - really guys?). Good up tempo version. Sounds like the way we play it at church,1
not what I thought it would be I downloaded this song thinking it would be upbeat like another version of the song I had heard. this is nothing like what I was looking for.,0
Five Stars great tune,1
"Quiet Please Mahler symphony No. 5 is one my favorite, however there is a reason this version costs less than some of the others you can find.

This is a recorded public performance.  While listening you will hear the sounds of coughs, sniffles, crackling seats, page turning (from the orchestra), and other disruptions.  At one point, during a moment of quiet, I swear I thought I heard the sound of a draft, like you might hear inside a cave or something.

I can't recommend this title at all.  Unlike in a movie theater, where you can try to ignore disruptors and focus on the movie, you can't focus here, because when you try to listen you can only hear them shift in their seats.",0
Terrible sound! Like the original song but the sound quality is terrible for this version. Sounds like it was recorded directly from a car radio.,0
"This is not ""Cage the Elephant"" song. It is ... This is not ""Cage the Elephant"" song.  It is a rap song using the song ""Shake Me Down"" as background music. I had to remove it from my mp3 player.",0
Stellar! What a talent!  I wish she had more recordings. A great mesh of music and voice!!  I couldn't wait to write a review here! Kudos to Melissa Fournier and composer Marc Karmatz.,1
"Fantastic Latin Jazz album--Ana Kruger is outstanding! I really like Latin Jazz (and Bossa Nova), and it doesn't get any better than this.  Ana Kruger has a fantastic voice that works really well with the song selections on this album.",1
"I'm Not Sure What This Is I know the base for the song is O.R.T. sung by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, a fantastic vocalist and voice-actor.  What the shoddy, generic hip-hop music is that's layered over it, I have no idea.  I also can't seem to find any details about ""The Iris Project"" unless it's some sort of educational charity.  I gave it two stars because ""O.R.T."" is great, but I have no idea why this specific version exists or how it can be sold while having no apparent link to Miss McGlynn, Akira Yamaoka, Joe Romersa, or Konami.",0
one of the best horn sections of synth. Excellent horn section.,1
"Yordano!!!! Simplemente un gran canta autor orgullo de Venezuela...
Su disco es de todo un poco, desde las bellas viejas inolvidables hasta nuevas canciones llenas de amor.",1
"Brings Out Emotions Inside of You, You Didn't Even Know You Had With the smooth, relaxing and emotional synths on top of chopped up vocal samples and wickid drums, Mokhov has definitely carved out `his sound' on this album.  No doubt my favorite song is Midnight Love.  It's one of those songs that brings out emotions inside of you didn't even know you had...  Looking for the next album and hearing you push the envelop even further.",1
Serene and moving Really love this piece.  Very heartfelt.  Love the harmony and simplicity of the words and music.  It touches my soul.,1
"Sorry Hugh... Not loving this song.  The clip was ok, but I guess I just don't like his approach to jazz.  Oh well...",0
Beautiful ballad Hugh Laurie's singing voice is dripping with emotion. I really like it. I bought this single and I bought other songs of his. I would love to see/ hear him sing live.,1
Four Stars Love song ,1
Five Stars Awesome.,1
Five Stars Love the fact it plays for over an hour. Great sound.,1
Four Stars deep dish is deep,1
Five Stars One of the best electronic mixes out there.  And a deal at this price.,1
"A favourite album right here! Songs like N.M.P. (No More Pain), Love Yourself, Love Music, Promise Song and The D-Motion really makes this album worth your money. Although I've not really found a KAT-TUN song that is actually bad their are definetely some who rank way higher than others, especially N.M.P. which I haven't been able to stop listening to:)",1
great music This is great and interesting music. This is music that is both creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.,1
"one of the best kept vocalist secrets of our time - i wish ... one of the best kept vocalist secrets of our time - i wish this guy would go on The Voice - such power, really great songwriter as well, these are acoustic unlike his other CDs but really help to highlight his vocal quality - feels like a house party, really intimate and friendly, great listening",1
Two Stars Not a fan of Music Box..,0
Five Stars loved it,1
"Buyer Beware:  Please Read the Small Print!  Paranoid is not an import! What appears to be three import remastered CDs by the band Black Sabbath is actually only two.  The third, ""Paranoid"" is just a regular USA bargain bin copy.  I read the title over too fast and didn't absorb the fact that the CD I wanted the most because it was an import and remastered was not.  I feel a bit responsible and a bit duped.  So if you are after a good copy of ""Paranoid"" look elsewhere.",0
great remix This is a great remix of the origial. Where the original was slow paced. Thid remix speeds it up and keeps the same energy.,1
"A real STINKER! I've been a Hicks & Licks fan for way over forty years and as such can tell everyone that this is absolute TRASH! Do NOT buy this! I made it all the way through it once and will never listen to it again. There are AT LEAST a dozen Dan Hicks and His/The Hot Licks albums that sound WAY better than this crap--I should know, I have more than twelve of his CDs myself and listen to all of them regularly. Even with a couple of ""new"" songs on this album it's no good, much to my disappointment.
More important, now that Dan has passed on earlier this year (RIP, Dan!), do NOT buy any of his music that his family doesn't get some sort of benefit from, which apparently this garbage is. Want more? The songs on the disc run together, the sound is terrible, his classics are done in throwaway versions, etc., etc., etc. Where is the ZERO STARS rating when you need it? Somebody needs to be ashamed of themselves for this travesty.",0
"Amazing The first time I listened to this song, I knew I had to buy it. It's the side of Stone Sour that I enjoy.",1
"Awful The Spanish is incorrect, and the pronunciation is terrible.  Plus it sounds like they recorded this in their basement with a tape recorded from the dollar store.  I am embarrassed for them.",0
"The ending on this song is missing. I purchased ... The ending on this song is missing.
I purchased the same digital song from a different album, same thing.",0

Five Stars Best song of all time <3,1

rip off This product is not worth the money you get 17 seconds of one bird chirp it ia a rip off,0
Roar The cd skips and looks like a cheap imitation. Played it once and tried to download on my ipod but the poor quality didn't allow for a download. Waste of money and time.,0
"catchy 'teen-y bopper' song Good song that'll have you tapping your foot, nodding your head, shaking your hips and booty and singing along throughout the entire song",1
"Beautiful voices, instruments Beautiful voices, instruments.  I purchased this at a folk dance party and love it!  Some good Balkan dancing, and lots of easy listening",1
not 320kbps don't buy Great song but its nor at 320kpbs whats the point of paying Nything for this if its not high quality,0
"Excellent Single All of the songs on this EP single sound good, especially track 1 (extended mix) and track 3 (Aurosonic Remix).",1
not pleased at the cover was soaking wet. the album was scratched very badly. I have tried to return it but have not had any luck. not pleased at all,0
Bought for self Great Accompniment track which I will use again and again.  A very beautiful rendition of an equally beautiful song.  Good choice.,1
Uplifting This song is very inspirational and uplifting to the spirit of one who needs to be reminded at times of God's love for them!,1
One Star Record came without the albums jacket.,0
Five Stars So happy with this sound track! I been looking for this for so long!!!,1
"Four Stars Would've given 5 stars, but record skips on track one and two.",1
"BUYER BEWARE!!!  Don't even think about buying this.  It is pure junk. I buy records to listen to them.  This one is the worst sounding ""NEW"" records I have ever purchased.  I realize colored vinyl doesn't ever sound as good as black vinyl, but this one is exceptionally bad quality.  Dimples all over the record that will make your stylus skip, and it has loud background hiss throughout the record.  Listened to one side, shelved it, and there it shall remain.  You've been warned...!!",0
"Bad vinyl The vinyl had dimples in it, and it wouldn't play without skipping. I'm sure it would have been great though. :(",0

"let down for me This wasn't what I expected
 Its more like music for a spa. I am disappointed. I like his other stuff much better.",0
Falls short I would love to love this recording but they cut the last last movement of the Schumann short so they could cram-in two mediocre works.,0
"Come-a-tie-yie-whoop-a-lie-yay Every singer who wants to record a song of the Old West will include Chisolm Trail in their collection. Jack Elliott has the quintessential version. Not only does his song have energy, but it conveys such mirth and happiness. This is so very clearly evidenced by his phrasing of the chorus line as  ""Come-a-tie-yie-whoop-a-lie-yay"". I first heard Jack sing this on Pandora and had purchased it before the following song was over. Believe me, you can't go wrong with Jack's singing of this Western standard.",1
"Bye pass this I loved the first two albums , yes they were, and was hoping to love their latest. No such luck. First two songs are OK but its all downhill from there. The vocals by the Alessi brothers are annoying, and where is the rock , remember White Tornado?",0
"Wonderful music and performance Wonderful  music and performance, but side two is so damaged that I'll never play it again.  Not the description put up by the vendor.",0
beautiful nice voice nice tunes everythings well put together I recommend you buy this album is really good thank you jesus,0
"Disappointment! Considering the talent and their later work, I thought these were half-baked songs ( or ideas for songs) that didn't gell.",0
One Star DISAPOINTED,0
"A Great Rendition of Claire De Lune! I have loved this piece since I was a teenager, and that was a long time ago.  I was not familiar with Sarah Ainsworth, but her rendition of Claire De Lune is absolutely beautiful.  For those unfamilair with the music, it is very melodic and relaxing.  Well worth the money.  The vendor provided great service.",1
Relaxing Music I work in a situation where beautiful music is appreciated & this works perfectly. I will purchase much more in the future.,1
"The Only Time Harnoncourt Has Ever Been Too Slow? I usually love Harnoncourt's brisk, rhythmically brilliant, beautifully faceted conducting, but this ... just isn't working. Most of the tempi are oddly slow, and the singing is only okay. Barbara Bonney is a surprisingly poor Adele ... ""Mein Herr Marquis"" completely misses the mark, with no sense that Adele is pretending to be a great lady. Many high notes are hooted. Gruberova's ""Czardas"" is excellent, but overall she is shrill and seems always a little under pitch. The German is weirdly ""chewed,"" which makes many of the musical lines feel spat-out and disconnected ... granted, German is a tricky language in which to both enunciate and maintain a clean line, but I've heard it done... just not here. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this.",0
"Too quiet I had to turn my system up almost all the way in order to even hear it , and I own a Bose.",0
Love it Roy Orbison's voice is eerily augmented by K.D.Lang's .  It' a great version,1
Poor audio This download sounds distorted - not pleased with the quality. Not pleased with it at all. Poor audio quality - can I get a refund?,0
Good Feeling-Flo Rida I love this song.  It makes me get up and dance.  It does make me Feel Good.  I would advise people to purchase this if you need something to pep you up. It works.,1
"Can't get it in a CD I gave this a two star because the CD was not available.  I listen to it on my IPhone.  The music is a beautiful collection for MP3,  but I would also like the CD",0
Two Stars Not really into this program.  Could not get interested!!!,0
"Great song! What a wonderful song.....great lyrics, tune and it has such a soothing melody.  I enjoy the song each time I play it.",1
"So Not In Love I love k.d. lang, but this is just not up there with my favorite versions of this haunting Cole Porter tune. It's not even really true to the melody.",0

Straight Trash Help me fall asleep at night Straight Trash  Help me fall asleep at night,0
It's  popular Russian song of 90s. It is my favorite song so far. So much sadness and passion is in Bulanova's voice. Hear it and see.,1
One Star Not a fan. Misleading in my opinion.,0
"YouTube Better Found this song on YouTube, so I bought it not the same. So I was very Disappointed in the mp3 I got.",0
name is misleading This is Baroque music with a South American flavor. It is well done and could be of interest to someone who likes Baroque music. It is not Salsa music as it is currently understood.,1
"Great riffs, thoughtful lyrics, solid debut! I've had this disc for awhile now and can definitely recommend it to rock fans.  From the heartfelt melody of Fuse and Unbreakable to the energizing riffs on Paragon this album brings you the full spectrum.  If you aren't energized after listening to Secret Wars (the track, but also the entire album) you need to check your pulse.  Production value is top notch, this is not your typical debut.  Support independent artists, support genuine rock, do yourself a favor and grab this cd.",1
Five Stars Love it!,1
"Disappointed! It's not that it's a bad album, it's just not good for a Red Hot Chili Peppers album. I don't know one other album that they put out that only had 2 or 3 tracks that I liked.",0
"dissipointed I used to love the red hot chili peppers but they just lost their sound. It sounds like they made ""I'm With You"" just to make a few more sales and while they were at it they tried to market it to as many people as possible instead of make it based on artistic vision. In my opinion they completely sold out. R.I.P. The formally true men who didn't kill coyote.",0
Five Stars Another great song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.,1
Four Stars Excellent,1
Five Stars Good value getting 2 albums worth of songs on 1 CD.,1
"""ONE CAN ONLY AWAIT VOLUME TWO."" These words, I wrote 40 years ago when the album was released. The presumptuousness of ""....Volume One"" for a 'superstar' (a word too much in vogue at that time) compelled me to write that terse review. Actually, it was not so much a review as an ad, part of several mini-photos and descriptions that were not much longer. Sherman, a likeable enough fellow, was on the TV series SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS as a parallel to Michael Landon's ""Little Joe"" character on BONANZA. So.......now you know! (For the record --- as it were --- I never listened to this collection. They didn't give us turntables. However, I notice you can buy one here at Amazon.com...!!!!)",0
Love it Great Song - Her vocals are great and the sound from Avicii.  Pick this track up right now - you will not be sorry about it.,1
very satisfied very satisfied. Its just what expected. i've been looking all over for this CD. i got the item before the actual date,1
"Interesting Synths + Original Vocals = Awesome track I think the subject really says it all.  Frenetically chirping keyboards, with a couple atmospheric breakdowns, and an interesting vocal delivery make up the bulk of this song, and if that's your thing, you should buy this song my friend.

I first got into Genevieve's music with her previous band Pollyn (also on Amazon), which is a lot more ""laid back"" in comparison to this venture with Louis Cole, so it's neat to her her voice in another setting.

Side note - If you do like this track, check out the band Knower, because that is what these two (Genevieve and Lous) record under now.",1
Five Stars I have always loved this disc--this is the third one I have bought because I wore the others out!,1
"Nothing Special Typical 80's style AOR...immature songwriting and clumsy lyrics. If Simon wasn't Pete's brother, he would not be in the music business at all.",0
"THIS BAND STINKS SO BAD I KIND OF LIKE THEM Yes, this band is almost so bad that you can't help but like them. I first discovered seventh Avenue back in the mid-1990s. I was really into bands like Helloween, Blind Guardian and the like; this band, was said to be very much like the other melodic, German metal acts that were popular in those days. Needless to say, I was curious and the artwork on the album covers seemed to call out for me to buy all of the available albums by Seventh Avenue in one fell swoop. The outcome of that purchase, Seventh Avenue does have a hint of Helloween and the like in their music, but there is one major difference here; and that is that Seventh Avenue's music can be so speedy, that it almost spirals out of control. Don't get me wrong, they have some good songs and you can hear that they're actually pretty good musicians on some of their compositions. It just seems that the guy who wrote all of the songs, is so concerned with being fast, Zippy full speed ahead metal that the songs can become almost incoherent. The guitars are so fast in some of the songs, that the lyrics sounds like they were squeezed in there with a shoehorn and bellowed out with no thought to where the melody was going. Hence, some of the songs by Seventh Avenue sound very amateurish and thrown together. Honestly, some of their music is as orchestrated as a random car crash. But yet, on some of the songs, their talent shines through and you find yourself actually liking this band despite the mess that may populate the rest of the album. Over the years, I have formed a like/hate relationship with this band. If anyone is interested in picking up onep of their albums, I would suggest they start with South gate, this is the best of their offerings and is the most solid album they ever did. The rest of the albums have moments that shine, but also lots of moments that have one reaching for the Excedrin by the time the song is over.",0
Not the right song Different song than what Pandora is playing. Pretty much a total waste of money and time. Really wish Pandora and Amazon would make sure they are directing people to the right songs.,0
"Can't Listen To It I love the song, but it won't download to my device. What's the point of buying if I am unable to listen to it whenever I want?",0
One Star I like the song but not so much the singers.,0
"Great band, bad record Don't get me wrong i love This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb, but this is a RECORD and the designed it with a few songs that really need a digital player ot sound good. I got into vyinl for better quality(no digital) and this record turns on that",0
"Excellent Debut This is Dan Wall's first recording from 1981, featuring all original material.  Shades of McCoy Tyner and Thelonius Monk, with a twist. Great keyboard work from Wall with beautiful accompaniment by Steve Grossman.",1
"Great! After waiting several years for new, original material from Boyz II Men, we finally have it with ""More Than You'll Ever Know"" featuring Charlie Wilson.  Mr. Wilson blends his voice in perfectly with the Boyz and it's a great duet. If there's more of this to come on TWENTY, Boyz II Men's 20th anniversary album, then fans will be overjoyed!  The lyrics are amazing.  Can you imagine the guyz singing ""Still number one in my eyes, til this day I still get butterflies"" to you?  Wow!  It's definitely a love letter written in song.",1
Two Stars hate remix and of other songs!,0
Great Song Best arrangement I have heard of this song and I have heard many of them. It is played with much feeling.,1
"Return to the Past A reasonably good compilation from a performer who I enjoyed in my youth.  Along  with Jimmy Smith, Dave ""Baby"" Cortez was one of my first introductions to the music of the organ, which was more exciting than the classical organ music and religious organ music that I had heard up until then and which turned me off.  Like most rock music from the period, it is more a collector's item than a classical must have part of a rock 'n roll collection; but - in my opinion - well worth having.",1

"Brilliant and Beautiful! First of all this is a two disc set. 'Land' which is more pop oriented, and 'Sea' which is more like poetry with a background of the most gorgeous lush symphony you have ever heard.
So beautiful it is heartbreaking.
Truly a masterpiece!",1
"IMITATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HIGHEST FORM OF FLATTERY If this band is so tired of Thurston Moore, why do they so slavishly copy his sound?  Really doesn't inspire me to get the rest of the album.  Neither clever, witty, or relevant-if you ask me.",0

"Nothing Special Most of this CD is crowd-work. Rory Scovel wins the crowd over with generic, unoriginal banter. He seems like a funny guy, but the material is undeveloped. I've seen Rory present polished, gut-busting bits...but none were recorded on this CD.",0
"not funny One of the worst comedy cds I've ever heard and I've listened to too many to count. I listened through the whole thing and hated it. Would not recommend it to anyone. If you one a funny comedy cd, do yourself a favor and listen to John Mulaney or Mike Birbiglia instead.",0
"Great album if you're up for something a little different! I really enjoy this album by doop. Although I didn't really like the original song titled ""doop"", the re-recording of it on this album is actually pretty good. The rest of the songs are great. They're all incredibly catchy, and bring something a little different to the table. The only thing I am not crazy about are the 3 different versions of ""My Chihuahua"", however, they are still good songs.",1
Five Stars A classic from my youth!,1

Heard it on Fallon Last Night Awesome song.  Jackson performed it on Fallon last night and nailed it.  His voice is still golden.  First i'm hearing about the full album NOTE OF HOPE.

"Very poor quality This recording is very poor quality: scratchy, muffled, and nearly beyond understanding. It sounds like it was recorded with a pillow over the mic. I know this is a rare performance (Cochran only performed it live, as near as I can determine, so this probably is not a studio recording), but Amazon should not be selling something this inferior.",0
I've decided Ringo's casual performance of a Buddy Holly classic has just enough punch to be enjoyable and enough charm to sound fresh. Always a treat when he hits on a song in the range of his voice and delivers it with such ease. I've thought it over and decided I like it.,1
One Star Am I only able to listen to th is on the Amazon app?,0
Five Stars Great song. Love it!,1
One Star Lego M is not singing in this version as implied.,0
"A Very Nice Cover This version of 'Everyday' brings some of Patrick Stump's 'world music' style to the Buddy Holly classic. This piece has been overplayed a lot, leading people to think it's low-energy or outdated. The addition of some percussion (marimba, in particular) to the intro and rhythm tracks makes a nice update, and helps people hear the song's energy again. One of the greatest things about Buddy Holly's music was his personal style, but this album has many artists 'doing their own thing' with his songs. I was very pleased to be able to download just this track (definitely the best one on the album) through Amazon.",1
Five Stars Great cover of Nirvana's song.,1
"GOT LISTEN TO THIS SONG ON GOOD SPEAKERS, ITS AWSUME GREAT SONG - YOU HAVE GOT TO HEAR THIS SONG ON GOOD SPEAKERS, IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!!!LOVE IT",1
"Holly lives on........ I generally do not like tribute lp's......but this one is worth not only the listen but the price of the disc or down-load.  2 of the best cuts are Stevie Nicks and Lyle Lovett.  Buddy Holly's music gives real meaning to the term ageless, as his music works as well or even better today then when it was released originally.  Peter Allen .....  made great choices in matching performers with songs.  Buy it !!! You will not be disappointed....",1
Buddy Holly sung by Stevie Nicks I love Stevie Nicks rendition of this old buddy holly song.  Her voice adds a unique quality to one of the all time favorites. Gets me up and going each day!,1

"Great music, but incomplete album I've always loved this score and am thrilled to see it finally available, even if it is only a digital download and not a CD.

However the version here is a disgrace. Amazon has left off the last 4 tracks from the album. They also charge nearly twice as much for this butchered version as Mr Lindes does in the store at his official site, hallindes dot com.

Go to his site to buy the full 15-track version.",0

"but it might have been nice to read whatever is printed on the jacket I bought this CD as a gift, so I have not listened to it yet.  My goal was to get Beethoven performed by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, and this is IT!  The surprise was that it is from China, and all the descriptions on the cover are in Chinese!  Since it's Beethoven, I'm not too worried about that, but it might have been nice to read whatever is printed on the jacket!",1
"Awful This collection of songs isn't worth the money. There are some good songs here, but the sound quality is horrible.

Several songs are mislabeled, and some of them are not even ""Crooner"" songs. Avoid this.",0
"I Love YUI Honestly I already had the regular version of this CD but I love YUI and is sort of a collector of her albums so I decided to get it.

"Sound Quality Good, but tracks mis-labeled I ordered the digital download of this recording so my family could sing along as they prepare for a production of Oliver.

Unfortunately, 5 or so of the .MP3 files were mis-labeled. All the songs were there, but it was surprising/annoying to hear ""Oom Pah Pah"" when you played the track titled ""I'd Do Anything"".

I'm fairly tech savvy, so I did manage to sort out the track titles, filenames and info with an .MP3 tag editor, but that was more work than I bargained for. Ah well, the show must go on!",0

"Tremendous, soul uplifting music The musicality of all the layers of piano, Native American flute and prayer chanting, along with synthesizer is like....what I imagine being in Heaven must be like.

It was of Peabo Brysons best songs in my opinion, but it is one that I don't get to hear often so when I heard it recently I knew I had to find and purchase this classic R&B soul melody.",1
"Not a very good These are recordings by unknown people, not the originals I was expecting.  Not a very good album",0
"Heard It All Before Pretty disappointing. All the selectios are so overused and familiar even if you down know them by name. Stick with good movie soundtracks like ""Out of Africa,"" ""Somewhere n Time,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" The Hours,"" and ""Shindler's List.""",0
Disappointed!!!! Not very good!!  The instrumental was good but the singing on some of the songs was terrible!  Don't purchase this.,0
"STOP! sounds like nursing home music, thought I was getting REAL movie soundtracks. When something says  ""movie soundtracks""  one would naturally assume you are getting the actual Movie soundtracks, not some wanna be orchestra playing them, their version and some sounding like nursing home or elevator music.  Do Not Recommend... worst $6.99 I ever spent.",0
Well worth repeated listenings I am not a scholar of Nielsen's work so I do not know if there are better recordings but this sounds good to me. I especially enjoyed the quartet in F major.,1
"He is an incredible singer/songwriter I bought this album three days ago and it has been on repeat ever since. I just saw the cover and decided to listen to some of the songs on itunes. ""Truth"" and ""Beginning of the End"" just spoke to me! I thought for 8 bucks what the hoot. So I bought the whole album and love it!! Also on Itunes all his reviews (74) had 5 stars (well two dudes gave him 4). And his previous albums as a whole also had 5 stars. Definetly no regrets! This guy really is incredible, and he writes all his own stuff. I have never heard of this guy, but he officially does have a new fan. If your looking for a new voice and lyrics that seem to just written to you then pleas do yourself a favor and buy the album.",1

Ugh! I heard a clip of Harlem Nocturn on one of the Mike Hammer audio books and thought this was it ... I was wrong. It's to much Jazz and not enough Blues.,0
"Single"" 7 Single Edit I have this already. But I thought that this was an extended version. I had heard it on TV, on the music channel. It was from the Disco Years Collection. So because it said 7"", I thought it was the extended version.",0
Five Stars Very encouraging song,1
"This version is inexplicably missing a measure of the recording After listening to this .mp3 in its entirety, I discovered that this version is inexplicably missing a measure of the recording. Most people wouldn't notice it, but it does disturb both the harmony and makes the number of measures uneven. Look for the other copy of this song under its proper name: the title of this selection is not 'Eddie Was a Lady' but rather 'Eadie Was a Lady'. My support of LGBT rights notwithstanding, the former would must needs be a very different song and I suppose it is debatable whether Merman would have performed it. Nevertheless, Eadie Was a Lady is one of Merman's signature tunes, although the show for which it was written seems rather deservedly forgotten. I would call this version, with a rousing orchestration by Jay Blackton, arranger and conductor of the famous Merman/Martin duet for the Ford Motor Company 50th Anniversary telecast (now available elsewhere on Amazon,) the definitive rendition. Other performances changed the words (there were certain subjects you just couldn't mention on television, and prostitution was one of them) and others suffer from less than ideal sonic properties. This one combines one of Merman's most enthusiastic performances of the song with a very decent pre-hi-fi recording and the splendid Blackton orchestration.",0
"A True Return to Form I have had the good fortune to live with the new Scott Matthews album, What the Night Delivers,  for a little while (courtesy of signing up for an early copy as a result of being at the superb Wolverhampton show a couple of weeks ago) Its official release on San Remo Records isn't due until September when it comes out alongside a raft of shows around the UK. It can however be ordered now through his website for those who, understandably, can't wait until then.

Having heard a few of the songs from the album at earlier shows, and hoping they presaged a set of songs that engendered the excitement of the first album, I didn't want to rush into comment for fear of letting my hopes run away with me. But now I know the whole set a good deal better and, without being a retrograde step,  they are a return to the things that first grabbed me about Scott Matthews.

Gone is what was, in hindsight , the slightly over-blown band sound of Elsewhere and here is a determinedly intimate and up-close album, concentrating on the Mr M's vocals and guitar work, an album of rare delicacy and lightness of touch. After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!

Although the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most excellent supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.

As suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.

There are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perhaps not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Bad Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, perfect in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.

Also in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the beautiful walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Bad Apple for instance.

To my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.

The album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.",1

MTV and VH1 defined this group as grunge, like Nirvana, Collective Soul, Marcy's Playground, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Stoneroses, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, etc.  I watched Bush concerts on TV.  It looks worth attending.  I think I heard all the Bush songs, however, I stumbled onto this song while watching one of their concerts on AXSTV Ch. 340 recently.  I had to write down a couple of the lyrics to search for it by ""song lyrics"" on Yahoo, my favorite search engine.",0

"Uniquely relaxing! I have listened to a many Zen-like tapes along the years, but Zoe Sameth's Deep Relaxation tape has made a huge difference in my life.  Her voice is uniquely smooth and calming, and the background music is delightfully nature-invoking.  Encouraging the listeners to adapt her instructions to their specific needs, her guidance inspires them to connect with their own love and light in a very touching fashion.  The tape also has a bonus of 30 minute additional minutes of just music, ideal for further personalized relaxation.  It accompanies my regular yoga practice right after the deep relaxation--making a huge difference especially when I most need it!

Miku! Forever! I love this mp3 album well worth it. I do love Jpop and the mixture of dubstep with it. Purely awesome! I personally got into Jpop because I realized how Americans have such bad taste in music nowadays. I mean seriously how did Justin Bieber get so damn popular with the girls or every1 for that matter? Then we got all the others who really suck and I just hate michael jackson because he's gay for raping little boys... Enough said. Jpop is waaaaay better!,1
"Great album with unexpected superb tracks The combination of vocals on this album surprised me in so many ways---all in all I came away loving many of the tracks and loving the combo of Joss Stone, Mick Jagger and the others on several of their hits. I highly recommend this album to those who love all types of music---i am a lover of all rock sounds, but this combo had unexpected upbeat vocals as well as some slow mellow tunes---all in all a terrific album to add to one's collection.",1
"Dull I listened to the samples before buying this album and was really impressed with the variety and the overall musical vibe from the different songs.  After buying it, though, I'm convinced that I should've stuck to listening to the samples.  The problem is that something which seems clever and interesting for 20 seconds sometimes becomes quite borrowing when you drag it out to 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 minutes with minimal musical variation.  The album has a lot of different feels to different songs, but each song winds up repetitive and dull with no worthwhile lyrics to keep the listener engaged.  As a result, the overall impression from the album is just that it's dull and uninteresting.  If they'd mixed the whole thing down to 10 minutes instead of 50, it would probably be fantastic.",0
"Stupid album With all the buzz around it, obviously this album generated high expectations.. But after listening to it few times, I think it is pathetic. The title song sounds like some track from Shaggy!",0
"Not to Shabbey Nice feel and flow for a big group,Jagger and D. Marley sound great together with Stone doing her THING. A much needed break from The chili peppers and lil Wayne or the other albums of this year.",1

Couldn't agree more with the previous rating I could not even get through the free 30 seconds. I expected a LOT more from Leona. She is a talented artist but this has lame written all over it.,0
"Disappointing I love chamber music and enjoy listening to selections played on FM stations while driving. Had hoped this would be a good alternative to the radio, but the selections are somehow disjointed, some seem poorly recorded. Not a music expert, but I am a part-time musician (folk, blues, bluegrass, Irish) who listens primarily to classical selections and I know what I like.  Unfortunately, can't say I particularly like this collection but it was certainly cheap enough so not much lost for the experience.",0

"A Love Poem to the Entire Brass World When Louise Baranger conceived this project, she picked on all the usual suspects and they all delivered. From Chris Martin, principal of the Chicago Symphony to Allan Vizzutti, the seminal crossover classical-jazz artist, many of the brass world's greatest luminaries graced this paen to beloved professor, trumpet virtuoso and dear friend to all of us trumpet players: Fred Mills. For me, though, the most poignant moment came as Ron Romm stepped forward to say goodbye musically to his fellow Canadian Brass co-conspirator. Performing with his wife, Avis, Ron played about the most touching version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow this side of Judy Garland. To buy this CD is pay tribute to one of the kindest, gentlest, most generous and flat-out brilliant artists of our time and contribute to a most worthwhile cause - a scholarship to be awarded each year to a particularly deserving young musician given in Fred's name. I heartily recommend this two-CD set to all who knew or ever heard the great music Fred created and then imparted to his many students over the years. Yes - this is indeed a treasure offered to Fred with Love.",1

Childrens Mix The MP3 'Genera' for the MP3s on this album gets labeled 'Childrens Mix'.  The mix is as the other reviewer said - not the original artists.  If you are used to dancing or exercizing to these songs you'll be disappointed with this mix.  The depth in the music isn't there so you won't feel like dancing to the music.,0
"Not the original songs - beware! None of the songs on this MP3 album are original.  All the other songs are reproductions by other bands.  While the recording quality of the songs is fine, they are lackluster when compared to the originals.  If having close approximations to the songs is okay with you, then you get a lot of songs for the money.  But otherwise, pass on this album and buy one with the original tunes, or buy the MP3's one by one.",0

Basia I love but.... I can't imagine why Basia had to team up with another female vocalist I've never heard of and actually has a weak voice in comparison to hers. Was she doing her a favor...hmmm.,0
"Intimate Basia This song is from ""It's That Girl Again"" and while that version features the typical production value from Basia complete with Bossa Nova and Samba hooks this version is stripped down and Basia's voice higher in the mix. The bare bones arrangement makes this song more intimate and I prefer this version over the original.  I wish Basia would record a bit more frequently, I was surprised this album was released so soon after ""It's That Girl Again"" I hope it won't be another ten years for the next one.",1

"THIS IS JUNK I am a big fan of PVD and I have most of his remixes and have seen this man perform live he is suppose to be a trend setter in the musical world of trance/electronica.  This CD of bonus beats is garbage, this cd has hip hop samples that is not all that they are just simple break beats.  I would think if PVD is going in this direction you would expect it to be a lot better, especially with the different programs that he uses (ABLETON and SERATO LIVE) I could understand if he would create a fusion of hip hop and trance beats.

PVD is losing it this and between VOLUME, REVOLVER remix and this he should just go back to the studio and create a cd like IN BETWEEN.",0

"Sickeningly contrived to appeal to ladies who fall for this stuff I was hesitant to be the first reviewer some four years after this was released, especially since I am giving it one star.

This falls under the category of being caught up in the moment at a live show with a few too many drinks in me, and then buying the CD from the artist at the end. In this case, it was when he was the lead singer for Blood, Sweat & Tears. I get the CD home and it is nothing at all like what I saw at the show. Sure, he has a great voice and stage presence, but the songwriting on this is so contrived to appeal to gullible women that I am actually ashamed to own this one. To the used bins it will go.",0
"Great for listenting, hooping, or jumping I find new songs and old ones I've forgotten about for hooping and jumping by listening to Pandora. I ran across ""Song Of The Old Rake"" a few months ago. For either listening or exercise, this is a great song.

"Throw all your hiphop out! These songs are what didn't make it on the original ""Sex Style"", which is a classic, and this album still blows away any hiphop put out today.  Kool Keith is an artist, a true original in a genre which is getting increasingly boring. Grind up all your JayZ, Kanye, Drake, Eminem and all that mainstream hogwash. Grind it up and dump it on your garden, as that crap will surely help the garden grow. Then, bring the family inside and set them down in front of the stereo, and have Keith teach them about the birds and the bees.",1

"The most slept on battler in KOTD brings fire on his freshman effort There's not much to say about 24/7, except he may be the most underrated battler I've ever seen. His debut album is an instant classic and brings so many different levels of awe. I hope he makes it big. I'll follow him for years to come.",1
"Long, Detailed Review After hearing 2 songs from this guy before this album dropped, I figured it would be a decent album with just raw rapping and not much actually being said.

I was wrong.

The album is entirely produced by Tony Mahoney from the UK, and the beats are all very dark and depressing, none of them being traditional hip-hop type beats, the instrumentation ranges from horns to an upright bass even to an accordion on one track. The album is 12 tracks divided into 3, 4 track parts. To simplify the three parts they could be labelled as Sadness, Anger, and Self-Analysis respectively, while through the whole project he struggles in his fight with alcohol. By the end of the first track you realize that this album is going somewhere serious and you're in for a ride, when you get to the third, The Underground, you start to figure out 24's opinion on hip-hop is very atypical. Not to call it right or wrong, but he doesn't want to make ignorant club bangers an street anthems, but he also not concerned with getting the fans away from it. He expresses the intent to make his music the way he likes it because hip-hop isn't worth saving for an ignorant audience. Track 4 comes in, the melody of the beat is a lady singing in Spanish over the harmony of an acoustic guitar. He keeps the song relevant to the album, furthering his status as a loner while flexing his raw rapping skills more than any other track on the album. Ridiculous bars such as ""Take a shot to the head and listen to Cobain."" and ""Thinking you on C's level but you 20,000 leagues under me."" and a double time spat clean enough to make Tech N9ne nervous. Enter part 2, Anger. Cam feels the need to say ""F*** you"" to a lot of people, starting with fans that won't leave him alone on The Neverending Story of The Parasite, asking them

""Wanna go to my school and get my degree for me? Go to my job and work these 40 hours a week for me? Come up with these ideas and think for me? Have battles every night with these drinks for me? You wanna know how it feels to always be drunk at home? How it feels to live life without a comfort zone? No? Alright cool then stop asking me stupid questions and leave me the f*** alone.""

The next target is the record executives pushing young artists into neglecting their skills and churn out simple mega-hit singles, the last target is the government on The Warden, I felt this song was misplaced, it fits the mood of the album but not the themes so much. I briefly discussed the album with 24/7 himself and he said he felt the same way while writing it, but he explained it as he's so angry with the world at this point in the album that he's getting everything off of his chest all at once before he gets into the final act. One thing in particular I liked about The Industry and The Warden was that in the first verses of each he rapped from the perspective of the record executive pushing the rapper to sign the contract and the government official filling our heads with propaganda and assuring us that they know what's best respectively.

Part three is at least as personal as the first, probably more. My Apologies delivers precisely what it promises, he realizes that he is just as flawed as everyone he has spouted off at. Now that he's alone he's trying to make amends for all the isolation he has placed himself in. Battle Cry has the most positive vibe of any song of the album, almost as if he's sobered up and cheered up, starting to realize where he stands in life.

Track twelve comes in. It started with the sound of empty bottles clanging together, and he almost-mumbles the words ""They say alcohol is man's worst enemy, but the bible says to love your enemy. That's word to Frank Sinatra babyyyyy."" The song is almost like a relapse, he displays a mixture of cockiness, and frustration almost as if he's back to where he was in the first two parts. The piano and upright bass keep playing long after the lyrics end, and that's it.

This is 100% honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's genuine, personal, and poetic. At 22 years old, and this being his 1st album, an incredible potential to do something very big for rap is shown.

""I won't be compared to Eminem, Lil Wayne or Hov. More like Fitzgerald, Hemmingway and Poe.""

"What a voice! I've had the pleasure of seeing Josh Young on stage as Marius in Les Mis (national tour), Che in Evita (Stratford Festival), and Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar (Stratford Festival).  I knew he was a phenomenal talent, and when I first listened to this album, it blew me away.  If you like listening to a pure talent singing great music, I'd encourage you to buy this album - and also catch Josh as Che in the upcoming tour of Evita.",1
"Beautiful, tantalizing. I had the great privilege of seeing Josh perform the role of Judas Iscariot in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" this week.  His performance took my literal breath away, so I went home and purchased his newest music, and was not disappointed.  Only further intrigued!

I am not a music critic, only a fan of music, so forgive me that my review is not technical.  Only  emotional!

Josh's voice pours out like honeyed wine.  Yes, it is sweet, but he can also deliver such sadness and pathos, that adds a tartness, a crispness to songs we have heard before.  The song ""When She Loved Me"" was a great favorite of mine already, and this rendition is so singular, so moving.  I found a new respect for the lyrics, and for how artists intrepret various songs.

I am not ashamed to say my eyes welled up during ""The Rainbow Connection"", a song that lovers and dreamers have adopted for 30 years.  He brings a gorgeous voice to the sentiment, and it's never corny or false, the feeling comes through and touches, even penetrates the listener.

Every song carries Josh's passionate, but angelic stamp.  He is the angelic voice that is burnished by a fiery humanity.  I recommend his music to any and every one who wants to be moved, transcended.

I have wishlist of songs that I would love to see Josh do for his next project, but would be equally happy with whatever he chose to interpret.

"only a few minutes It's too bad that artists split out their albums in a selling forum that doesn't provide enough information to make an informed choice. I found this using my kindle, and bought it because nothing stated it was only 3 minutes long.

It's a very simple and nice message , but it shouldn't be for sale on its own.",0
don't buy it I am a big fan of Bhagavan Das.  He sounds terrible on this live cd.  I listened to it once and I could barely make it through.  I am probably going to throw the cd in the trash because it makes me sick to look at.  Waste of money.,0

"Great percussion and cool song! For anyone who is old enough to remember The Lemon Pipers and their 60s hit, ""Green Tambourine,"" you may remember the electronic slide that characterized that recording and marked it as a trendsetter. Rick Coghill was the guitarist and created the effect. In this Messianic Christian (Rick is not Jewish but adopted the nickname ""Levi"" for laughs) live performance, Rick gives an amazing performance by taping a reed to his mic, putting his mouth over it and does the voice of God as well as some neat vocal riffs to complement lead singer Joel Chernoff. This is truly good stuff... and the live performance is even better that the album cut (IMHO).",1

"A romantic French icon recites lyrics to music. Talking songs A more apt title would be romantic  recitations to music. However that having been said the disc is immensely enjoyable. Boyer acts out the lyrics and the orchestra and chorus provide the music. Gigi is an interesting example. In the movie Louis Jordan also spoke the lyrics but in tempo and made one or too attempts to burst into song. Charles just recites and let's the musicians do their magics. If you are a fan of romantic songs,romantic movies and of Boyer I highly recommend the LP or disc.",1
"Great Music! I first heard ""Fall into the Sea"" by accident and I found it really interesting.  It's very original and has it's own unique sound.

"A film I will never forget When I first viewed the film I was overcome with emotion.  Many years ago I was engaged to marry a vet of the Vietnam war, and he was in the 1st Cavalry.  His last night his LZ was over run. I learned alot about the war from him.  I was in college 1970 to 1974, and he served his tour in 1969.  What did I know back then?  It was a war everyone was against, but I never took out my feelings about the war on the brave men who had no choice but to serve.  This film is true to life, about the sacrifices the men and their families had to endure. It spoke so true at the end when the narater said, ""...they fought not for their country nor their flag, but for each other."" I will always remember the devotion Lt. Cornel Hal Moore had for his ""boys"".  I love the scene where his radio operator tells him that they want him out in the morning to report in Saigon.  His words I think I almost know by heart...""I am in a fight and I object to this order to report to Saigon.  I will not leave my men""  Diane",1

"Product needs re-engineering. Virtually (1) no response from Apple regarding the unprofessional reproduction download quality  is an even bigger disappointment than the bang and clutter noises heard on this recoding. I have been a faithful Mac owner since 1984 and regret this latest debacle. Hey, it's not a big deal - only .99 cents but Apple's indifference to resolving the problem leaves a very bad taste. To compound the problem I trashed the recording at Apple's request then never heard another word - nothing

Also, you have to buy the entire album to get just the one piece of music (weirder), and the producer of this soundtrack thought it would be cool to sprinkle dialogue from the film throughout (weirdest), which I don't find so cool, personally (this isn't a campy Flash Gordon movie).

Working only made it to Broadway on the strength of Schwartz's Godspell and Pippin, of which this can't come close to in any way. The score is terrible, amateurish, and completely forgettable. Even the Broadway production felt like a community theater endeavor. It's no wonder it is rarely listed among Stephen Schwartz's many accomplishments. A formidable composer, even his bomb, The Bakers Wife has better music. Actually it has a ravishing score, but a book that can't seem to work.
Either way if you are expecting anything on a par with Godspell, Pippin, or Wicked..forget it. Working is bad, pure and simple, stay away.",0

"""Fall In Love"" With This Song When romance is in the air, nothing accentuates it quite like the right music, which, when done properly, has the power to magnify powerful emotions and moods. ""Fall In Love,"" by singer/songwriter/producer Ginger Patterson is a ballad that is almost undefinable. Containing both traditional and unconventional elements, it is like a fine, abstract piece of art; everyone who listens to it will hear something different, but it is open to interpretation and there is most definitely something there to appreciate.

The song begins with an interesting guitar, strings, and a piano melody that sets up the entrance of Ginger's sensual voice. Lyrically strong, ""Fall In Love"" tells of the things that are beautiful about being in love.  Ginger has a range of tones within her voice, and is capable of quickly and smoothly transitioning from a soft breathy sound to a full tone, with a touch of gospel conviction in her delivery, and very solid background harmony on her vocal overdubs. More tasteful keyboard sounds appear on the second verse, along with drums, a tambourine, and clever production ideas with regard to breaks in the phrasing, bringing cool surprises. In music, timing is everything. When you do something is just as important as how, and much thought was given not to overuse a sound just for the sake of doing so. The chords are solid and flow well with the way Ginger arranged her vocals, which are gripping in just the right places, pulling the lyrics and music together in a way that will remind listeners of loves past and present.

"I was disappointed in the 7HZ Theta version There are two version, the second of which is the 7 Hz Theta version (look at the album cover to tell the difference).

I was disappointed in the 7HZ Theta version.  There is a low level hum sound halfway through the recording that is annoying and distracting.

Get the regular (non 7Hz Theta) version.  That version is excellent.  I listen to it all the time. I downloaded the regular version for free (well, sort of) because I'm an Amazon Prime member.  I decided to purchase the 7 Hz Theta version because I wanted it in my permanent library.",0

"Outstanding series I have used this series for almost five months.  Although Ken Goodman recommends completing one hypnosis session per day, I find that I'm doing all six hynosis sessions within a week.  So, after about five or six weeks of using the sessions is when I really began to see results.  Particularly when it came to procrastination, that was the area I first began to notice change...typically, I've been very good at putting things off to the last minute; however, I began to catch myself saying no, do it now.  After four and a half months of doing a hypnosis session pretty much every day I see substantial improvements in all areas of my life.  Confidence is high and getting higher, as I said procrastination is becoming a thing of the past, I'm happier and a much better person to be around.

So, if you want to make changes in your life, hypnosis sessions for this series will definitely help...BUT, YOU MUST DO IT DAILY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, nothing changes over night.",1
"singing like Hendrix. I transcribed ""Soft Focus"" (tk I wouldn't quite say, as the other review said it is smooth jazz.  Case in point the severely distorted vibraphone from David Samuels, singing like Hendrix.  I transcribed ""Soft Focus"" (tk. 2) with the solo.  He really opened my ears.  The lp includes the stereo mix layout from said song showing the instruments and how they are panned - pretty cool.",1

"How Many Coughs Can You Count? Too bad. I was looking forward to hearing this recording but was disappointed the first 3-4 minutes in. It is advertised as a 'stereo' recording 'live' from the Met. Lots of echo was added to the sound making it more stereo-like but the singers sound far, far away...like within the next city block or so. The orchestra sounds like it is in your lap.

That's right folks, it was recorded by an audience member with a good seat in the front row. There is a woman who talks almost constantly near-by in a whisper and a man whose annoying coughing is the best sound on the recording. Sometimes he sounds so life-like you want to turn around to see who is standing behind you. It IS October in New York. I love so-called 'live' historic recordings but if there is a limit...this is it.

The best coughing sound effect record on the market. After the first disc I felt like I knew this gentleman. No repeated listening and off to the used record shop with you! Goodbye Kleiber 'live' and all.",0

"This is really their first album? This French duo from Lyons brings a polished product to the masses, enticing you to dance with their sexy sound that is well developed for such a young band. It is no surprise that they name Daft Punk and Air as their influences, as this sound is clearly of a Versailles band vintage, despite their slightly different origins.  Some of their riffs and loops remind me of a more dance-oriented version of the XX.  Be sure to check out their music video ""This Night a Soldier"" - which is a song strangely not on this album, yet really awesome.",1

"Met them in person - And got suckered in First off, I will say that this music is not really in my genre (I'm more of an orchestral person), but I will say that these guys do some pretty good music.

Ironically enough, they pulled me aside in one of the local malls out here, and asked if I had some time to listen to one of their tracks. Even though I was into a rather obscure musical blend, they still managed to pull out a track that I was instantly drawn to. Now, I could have walked away from there, but instead bought this CD from them in person for $20.00 - All the tracks on the disc kept me listening.

I guess in conclusion - I have to give them 4.5 stars (-.5 because although I like the music, it's still outside of my normal genre), and for providing me with an awesome disc to listen to.

"Simple, Sweet and Honest This recording of Gary Roadarmel alone with just a guitar and a microphone is a breath of fresh air in a world full of over produced music these days. The songs are beautifully constructed and Gary's vocals are right on at the right times and they crack just at the points that need to be there.

After all, who in their right mind would offer a 25 second cut from a song for the same price as a full track? Well, obviously, Amazon.com would. That's ridiculous!

"A Rare Treat from 1964. First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon for making this recording available as downloadable Mp3's. At the moment (9/6/15), this CD is not available, but the disc with both Beach Boys Songbooks can be had for $466-!400.00. In other words, essentially unavailable. I've noticed that Amazon is beginning to do this with other out of print CD's, usually 60's catalog, and I can only encourage them to do more of this because there is an audience out there for these titles if they're not $100.

The Hollyridge Strings were actually a rather radical idea for their day. Until they put out The Beatles Songbook in June, 1964, teen-pop, the music of Top 40 Radio, was generally considered off-limits for an easy listening instrumental treatment. You didn't here orchestral arrangements of the hits of Fabian, Dion and the Belmonts or the Everly Brothers on the radio or in restaurants and offices. Those songs were kids' songs and the whole genre of rock'n'roll was considered musically worthless. Then came the Beatles and that changed everything. By March, 1965 Time Magazine ran a cover story on the pop/rock scene, by Autumn, 1965 the Beatles would record Yesterday with a string quartet and get airplay on ""Adult"" stations and by 1967 Leonard Bernstein would be praising pop on a network TV special.

But this was in 1964, long before all that, when the idea of orchestral arrangements of Beatles and Beach Boys songs must have seemed like a crazy idea. The project may have been just Capitol Records (who were the Beatles U.S. label) way of further jumping on the Beatlemania Bandwagon as everybody else was trying to do, or it may have been a creative person at Capitol recognizing the melodious sound of the Beatles songs and how it would easily transpose. The work in any case fell to Stu Phillips, a noted composer-arranger whether or not it was his original idea. He was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music who had made easy listening albums for Capitol under his own name, and for Colpix Records produced hit songs Johnny Angel (Shelly Fabares), My Dad (Paul Peterson), Blue Moon (Marcels) and Goodbye Cruel World (James Darren). It was this familiarity with contemporary pop that gave him the ability to orchestrate it without losing its vitality.

The Beach Boys Songbook was the second release by the Hollyridge Strings who, of course, were whatever studio orchestra musicians Capitol had at the time, and it came out in the Fall of 1964. The sound of the orchestra is very transparent (helped by excellent remastering here), with the strings accompanied by horns, trumpets, flutes and extensive use of piano. As you'd expect, songs like Don't Worry Baby and In My Room lend themselves easily to this treatment, and She knows Me Too Well is a particular standout with its elaborate piano part. But the more rocking songs come out intact with all their punch, even Surfin' USA and I Get Around, which boldly leads off the album. This is no sleepy Mantovani strings oversaturating the tunes but an authentically creative reimagining of Brian Wilson's melodies that retains their spirit.

This album got as much play from me as the actual Beach Boys albums in late 1964 (note because Capitol also had the Beach Boys a tune like Wendy which was on the Top 40 when this album was released was able to be included). Stu Phillips went on to compose many movie scores and television themes and is noted for his music for Battlestar Gallactica.",1
"Not the original you're expecting The preview is deceptive.  After you order and you play the song, you will notice this isn't the original recording within the first second into the song.  If you haven't followed Foreigner then you may like this version.  I wasted $0.69 on this...bummer.",0
Disappointed I thought this would be the track I was used to from another Foreigner CD (can't remember which).  This version does not communicate the power and emotion that the original did.  Wish I had known.,0
Bold The song Pass At Me (feat. Pitbull) by Timbaland is an exhilarating song that appears to be about the singer andor singers basically saying that they love when particular women aggressively go after them/take the initiative in pursuing them.

"its alright/not buying again This is ok but i would suggest buying only a few of these mp3s separately you aren't missing anything money money every where and many 2 or 3 more including the affirmations track.
i think maybe this wasn't what i thought it would be this si about providing good service to your customers, i lack appropriate opportunities so maybe i should search for that
but ive ran into this problem before with her albums but i still was able to grow and still received something positive out of it
ok i am editing my review 4/27/16 from four stars to 2 (being nice)
ok heres why i will not purchase her mp3 again.
even though there were aspects of this mp3 i did not like i still used it. i noticed my attitude twords other people changed, i started getting more of a ""kanye west"" syndrome and believe that i shouldn't have to work for my success (as suggested in this mp3)  i actually shouldntve bought the whole cd.
but what i will say on a positive bullet is that i care less about others and feel as though people should pay me regardless ... i was actually raised to be the best i can be and its very hard and immoral to do some of the things suggested here.
honestly im not in a situation to ""pick and choose"" things often. so to pick and choose things based on ""quality"" is not a healthy option. i think this mp3 should have been more well thought out as everyone's situations are different. though it has given me courage to do things that needed to be done in a less than merciful way. what hurts the most is the acknowledgement of people who do not work hard who achieve massive success. i think this made my situation worse and more depressing if anything. i mean obviously a person buying this self help mp3 works hard and deserves more money however suggesting to be like those just born lucky is a hard pill to swallow im sorry.
ive worked hard my whole life and all it did was bring to light that i am NOT wealthy as i should be. as in my previous reveiw i would suggest to purchase money money everywhere. the othe mp3s are for people who probably do not work hard and ARE poor. oh and the other one about having a roommate who doesnt clean up after them selves is good. but i would never recommend this to a loved one as a whole mp3/cd just those 2. i found a similar mp3 by hypnosis live which says what she say but in a shorter yet more GRACEFUL way.
what anna thompson usually does are audio shamanic journeys. i think if your into that you will probably buy her mp3s but the problem is trusting what she is saying. so in conclusion the only thing positive that happend is me firing people who i should have fired along time ago.
all of the other results im not comfortable with oh yeah & one of those is starting accounts one to save and one to give away... um i stopped being as generous a long time ago because i honestly do not have the money to be donating to charities & i subconsciously had been giving me thinking ""oh it will come back"" after i realized why i stopped giving so much..its cuz I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY! i noticed after i realized i had less money. it makes me look like im rich to other people who probably want to use me though i don't know how great that is.
im glad i could do it in the future but right now i really need all of my money and can not afford to be Ms generosity all of the time people should be generous to me more often ijs cuz i really aint got it like that.
i think her intentions are good but for something like this i would suggest something more customized.",0

"Counter Culture Rip-Offs ... Floating out there just below the asteroid belt in a near earth orbit, The Avant Garde touched down momentarily back in 1968, where this twosome, in much the same manner as the songs McAuthur Park by Richard Harris, and of course Scott McKenzies San Francisco attempted to capitalize and co-opt on the hippie counter culture movement with two of the most insincere songs of all time, Naturally Stoned and Yellow Beads. In Yellow Beads they nearly talk through the song, as if imparting some special and essential secret knowledge that only they were privileged to, suggesting in a creepy manner as to what was necessary if one was considering heading out onto the hippy highway headed west into the sun  through truth be told, the counter culture daze of San Francisco nights was already splintering and crashing to the ground in a haze of hard drugs and unpleasantness.

Without hesitation, it should be understood that this was commercialism at its finest and most blatant, offering nothing of value, because these two were never part of the times from which they pretended to be.  Oddly enough Fowler and Woolery did manage to make the big time, with Fowler doing session guitar work for both Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, and Woolery becoming the eternal television gameshow host.

Happily this duo, and these songs, have been lost to space and time, surfacing only in odd collections that one nearly happens upon, making me to this very day feel damaged, taken advantage of, ripped off if you will, that tracks such as these would ever be considered as anything less than disingenuous.  But, time has an odd specter to it, wherein a spinning galaxy brings all things back full circle  causing me wonder how many lightyears it will be before the worlds Oh Wow slip through the parted lips some cute blonde in bellbottom hip-hugger pants as she hears these songs for the first time, thinking shes discovered a touchstone, a piece of the holy grail, or the X on a treasure map that never existed.

Super! I always thought of Nishizaki as a pop- classical not very serious player. Until I've listened to her Mozart and Beethoven sonatas. How wrong was I! Very top- notch playing. Deep and noble.  I think she is very underrated.,1

Beautiful and moving sacred piece This terrific piece of sacred music is a wonder to listen to over and over again.  Another good representation of German composers in this genre.,1
"Still just as awful Please don't get me wrong - Agostino Steffani's music is wonderful. It's just this performance and recording that are awful, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 review under Amazon's other entry for this recording:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alarico/dp/B001U1L9ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alarico</a>. However, I've been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing five-star reviews, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.

Those two reviews were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other's work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they've now changed their Amazon names to 'ML' and 'A Customer' respectively. Hang on - now they've both deleted their reviews on this page as well, and all their other Amazon reviews!) I'll avoid commenting on the details of the latter's review directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn't really anything plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn't take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first review I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perhaps a similar fate awaits the present review!

This leaves me with Magda Levi's review, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms' monograph&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polymath-of-the-Baroque-Agostino-Steffani-and-His-Music/dp/0195154738/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music</a>&nbsp;- from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha' '. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande's website, having recently contributed some material to it. However, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico' review here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my previous review, I tried to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the worst singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly awful performance and recording.

Reviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perhaps this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can't sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they're unlikely to get much better over the next 35 years.

This recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too bad either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani's music, and I'd greatly love to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I'm sorry to say, much of it is ruined by the poor singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone's beautiful chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace' is wrecked by poor singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Care Fiamme/ Amate Catene', is ruined by the same factors.

It's also worth mentioning that Steffani's roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.

Returning to the main business, however, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, terrible recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn't - I'd immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much better to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the reviews. Most of us here on Amazon, whether readers or reviewers, are not that stupid.",0

"Music that just makes you feel good...Pound and Beers I'm from the Kalamazoo/ Battle Creek area here in Southwestern Michigan and have had the privelege of seeing ""Pound and Beers"" on numerous occasions. I have been a guitar student of Joe's, and am absolutely astounded by this band's abilty to play their instruments in such an emotional way and make such beautiful music. I highly recommend ""Pound and Beers"" to anyone who enjoys great music that may just touch your soul!! A real, honest, and feel-good band, these guys are awesome!

"Just as expected! Seems like anything Juan Carlos Lozano makes is pure ear candy. This album sounds somewhat different to his past albums with the band Morbo, but he still manages to create beautiful soothing sounds and catchy hooks. The tempo of the songs is also slower and the lyrics more personal, never intending to possibly land any hits on the charts and therefore the production is noticeably crafted with care. Because he will always be linked to the band that brought him to the spotlight, Moenia, it is fair to compare this production with his fellow former band member Alfonso Pichardo, whose solo release went unnoticed but it was due to being hardly an effort or anything novel. That isn't the case with ""Nada Haces Por Mi."" Repeat listens will be required but simply because it is very enjoyable album.",1

It's pure dissonant noise, and very hard to listen to. If your planning on picking up one of the 3 of Hank III's new releases, I assure you, this is not the one, IT IS HORRIBLE!!! I'm sorry Hank, I love you and won't ever stop listening to you, but what the hell is this? This is the kind of crap you should have given CURB, not the fans.",0
"Princess Jellyfish closing theme. Bought this because it's the closing track in Princess Jellyfish.  It wasn't available last time I looked for it, so I was super happy to see it when I was trolling Amazon for anime themes last night.

There's another version available, too (listing the artist as ""Team Akihabara"").  That version is 1:54, while this one is just over 3:40.  (I bought both.)  This one seems to be the full-length track while the other seems to be the cut version that runs into and during the Princess Jellyfish closing credits.  (At least, I'm pretty sure that's the difference.  According to YouTube, the runtime on the closing credits is around 1:30, and that's *without* about 25-30 seconds of the ""Love is coming back"" bit and the musical lead-in to the primary lyrics. And btw, both versions include the intro.)  While this particular compilation credits the composer/arranger (Yamaguchi Takashi), it doesn't credit the artist, which Google tells me is Sambomaster.

Such a cute song!  (And a cute show, too.)",1

"Yet another Toots cover This is not the 5446 that you're looking for.  It's not really very good.  Sublime did a version that's better, although it's part of a medley track - Gold Album, Disk 1.

"Outstanding articulate jazz from Music City USA Too often now a days jazz is associated with elevator music. Well, this ain't elevator music. It's Everyday Magic, the second album from Nashville native, Rahsaan Barber

What's more, this album was recorded in Nashville - Music City USA. Nashville may be forever associated with country music, but, let me tell you, they have some cats down there that can blow. The band, also called Everyday Magic, is composed of Barber on tenor, alto and soprano sax as well as flute. Adam Agati on guitar, pianist Jody Nardone, Jerry Navarro on bass (and what a tasty bottom end he plays) and Nioshi Jackson on the skins. Rahsaan's twin brother, Roland Barber is on trombone on two hot tracks, as is percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez.  The album is released on Rahsaan's newly formed Jazz Music City label.

The album is laid out to display Rahsaan's virtuosity on all the saxes and flute, as well as his various influences. It opens with a bopping tenor show case tune, ""Jubilee"".The first thing that becomes apparent is Rahsaan's articulation on whatever instrument he features. It matters not how fast the tune, the clarity of the notes are amazing. This tune just grooves and brings back memories of John Coltrane or Kenny Garret.

from there, Rahsaan and the band cover the whole spectrum a jazz influences, Bop, Avant Garde, Gospel, Blues. Perhaps my favorite tune on the whole album is ""Why So Blue"", an in-your-face blues romp that'll make you think of Stanley Turrentine. Twin brother, Roland Barber is featured on some fine trombone work where he seems to be echoing Rahsaan's gritty tenor. Great work, family style.

Another highlight is, ""Innocence"", featuring soprano sax work that continues to show of Rahsaan's mastery of the different saxophones. The drummer, Nioshi Jackson,  lays down an infectious stutter-step solo and the interplay between the sax and the guitar is just killer. Close your eyes, and you can see a couple of kids playing in a spring garden. In ""Adagio"", Rahsaan finally shows off his flute work. As the title suggests, this is a sweet, quiet, slow tune. Rahsaan says it was composed on a dare to create a meditative spa kind of music. The album closes out with ""Memphis Soul"", a tight, electronic groove featuring percussionist Giovanni Rodriguez of the Latin-jazz septet, El Movimeinto which is co-lead by Rahsaan.

This is a great debut for the label and a more than fine sophomore effort from Rahsaan and Everyday Magic.  It may not be elevator music, but it is going nowhere but up.",1
"Polka Therapy rocks! The songs on this humorous album are well-written, the singers are talented, and the humor is great! I especially love the song ""I Hate 'Em Waltz"" with the lyrics, ""I hate cleaning the toilet and the never-ending dusting. Oh, I hate mustard, when you squeeze it and all that comes out is some watery stuff...it looks totally disgusting."" Anyone who drives a car will appreciate the cathartic confessions in the ""Road Rage Polka,"" and the ""BeatBox Polka"" inventively mixes generational styles. The songs truly lighten the spirit and use humor to put all of ""life's little aggravations"" into perspective. The songs also are so catchy that you will find yourself singing them to yourself throughout the day.",1
Beautiful! such a good feel heartwarming song one of my favorites on the album.  we've all felt this way at some point!,1
"Better Be Careful I love this song because it talks about vulnerabilities, and I think that's something that everyone can relate to. Beautiful song, with beautiful vocals.",1
Im a lightweight Lightweight is a pretty song. This song reminds me of Demi a lot. It's about a girl who never really had anyone to rely on but now she does and is scared to trust that person. She's asking the person to be gentle with her because she delicate. Beautiful job well done!,1
"Who's this This song is a song EVERY girl can relate to. A bunch of girls see this guy and they are like who is he? He's hot, he's got amazing eyes and one girl wants him all to her self. Dev and Demi sound just a like. Dev's rap is so catchy. Excellent song!",1

"I Wish This Song Was Louder! Without any reservations, it is easy for me to say that Electric Six is among the greatest bands in existence. Considering the phenomenal catalog of work perfected by this group, ""Heartbeats and Brainwaves"" is indeed the pinnacle of their lyrical and musical domination. Now, each of their albums is brilliant, but this one qualifies as an experimental masterpiece. Electric Six are sonic pioneers; they are loud pilgrims who set sail on the sea of American cheese in search of musical freedom to offer you the best songs instruments can make.
My greatest regret is that I didn't have the cash to hire Electric Six to play at my wedding, as there is no music more romantic and intimate as this. When the E6 van approaches your city, seek out tickets to the show, say hello (I see you!), buy some colored vinyl, play frisbee with Dick and realize you are now part of classic rock history.",1
"very poor audio NOTE: I do not own this album.

I just listened to the audio sample and it was so bad that it motivated me to write this review. I am a Hindu and am originally from India. Period. The computer generated voice makes the words almost incoherent and difficult to understand. Moreover, Perry Katy sounds  Katy Perry in reverse doesn't it?",0
Five Stars a beautful song well done by alain morisod...,1
"Middle of the night song This was that song when I forgot to shut off the radio, woke up in the middle of the night thinking: What a beautiful version of the song. I had to track down who sang it and get it on my MP3.  Well I did. She does a beautiful job on it",1

"Ottimo Southern Rock'n Roll Made in Italy. Non sempre  necessario rivolgere la propria attenzione agli States per ascoltare ottimo Southern Rock o per cercare interessanti novit, e quindi sono davvero contento di segnalare l'eccellente album d' esordio di una band tutta italiana proveniente da Lodi.

Gli Smokey Fingers sono un quartetto fomato da Gianluca ""Luke"" Paterniti ( voce), Fabrizio Costa (basso), Daniele Vacchini (batteria e percussioni) e
Diego ""Bleef"" Dragoni (chitarra elettrica e acustica) e ci offrono un album lungo e articolato con 12 tracce da ascoltare a tutto volume per godere in pieno tutta l'energia e grande passione per il rock di tradizione Southern che li contraddistingue.

Fin dalla opener ""Old Jack"", dal riff immediato e trascinante come pochi, si percepisce subito l'ottimo impatto sonoro e qualit compositiva della band e non  difficile immaginarsi in sella a una potente moto lungo le highway come quella raffigurata proprio sulla copertina dell'album.

Le atmosfere tipicamente southern tra puro rock'n roll e country rock, le ritroviamo in pezzi come Born to Run, Over the Line, The Good Countryside, tracce che da sole valgono l'acquisto, Crazy Woman e nella conclusiva Devil's Song, mentre in tracce come The Lover, Chains of Mind e Die for the Glory traspare tutta la passione per un heavy rock di chiara ispirazione anni '70/'80,  ma non mancano momenti melodici ( mai sdolcinati ) dove fanno capolino ottime atmosfere country western.
Da sottolineare alla traccia n. 10 una personalissima e grintosa versione della celebre Country Road del grande James Taylor.

In sostanza un ottimo debutto discografico con un album molto piacevole, graffiante, potente e di grande atmosfera per chi ama il Southern Rock e il rock'n roll sanguigno e polveroso in genere, per una band da seguire con attenzione.

A volte si celebrano ed esaltano prodotti di per s ""normali"" magari solo perch provenienti da luoghi di grande tradizione musicale per quanto riguarda il Southern Rock nello specifico, ebbene questo Columbus Way  certamente un ottimo album che vale la pena acquistare e godersi a tutto volume, con una punta di orgoglio per una band italiana di questo livello.",1

"Same Music as Lullaby Versions of Duran Duran by Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star This is the same CD as Lullaby Versions of Duran Duran by Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star. Identical recordings, same track order. The only difference is the name of the CD and the name of the band. Both are produced by Roma Music Group. I collect Duran, but really regret buying the disc at full retail price. Make sure you're only buying it for the packaging if you already own the Lullaby version. Feeling kind of ripped off.",0

"Same Content as ""Lullaby Versions of Grateful Dead."" Though I went ahead and ordered this CD, it has the same song selections as ""Lullaby Versions of Grateful Dead"", by Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  Both are produced by Roma Music Group.

"Electro and soul together - as originally intended. (Reviewing original vinyl release - can't speak for mp3 quality)

Another ""Planet Rock"" it ain't, but it comes close especially on ""Zulu Groove"".  There's a lot of the same Bambaatesque sound, but mostly a lot of bass and cowbell, synth and actual horns, and gogo flavor.  I think some of these songs were on Beat Street, or have the same sound.  Uptempo and positive, with intricately layered yet cohesive beats.

Looks like this was finally released in a digital form in 2011 - can't believe this never had a CD!  I hope that helps it reaches more a widespread discovery.",1
"A Terrific Artist Re-Discovered I had lost track of Willie Nile after his first couple of albums, recorded for Arista Records. 30 some years ago.  I was vaguely aware that he was still around and continued to work, but had paid no attention.  A neighbor of mind recommended his recent work and I listened (and then immediately bought) this album as well as House of a Thousand Guitars  and Streets of New York.

These are all absolutely terrific albums!  Well-written songs, tending to the anthemic, and well played and arranged.  If anything Willie's music is better today than when he was starting out.  That's a real rarity",1
"solid Nile Very good CD. No disappointment here. I enjoy listening to this artist. First discovered him on ""Streets of New York"", now I have three of his releases.",1
"rock and roll soul Very impressive album by the veteran rocker. I liked this one even more than his ""Streets of New York,"" which was also a solid set of songs. You can throw out names like Sprinsteen, Ian Hunter, and Nils Lofgen, and Willie Nile shares that same never-say-die rock & roll spirit. Not sure if the youngsters will dig these tunes, but for those of us that grew up in the 60s and 70s, this music really resonates.",1
Five Stars great,1
"Lame I know he's not alive anymore. But if he was, I'd say to Lou Reed, ""How dare you write such a song with such a tame sound about doing anything on the 'wild side'. The lyrics may have been controversial, but that doesn't offset the tame sound in my opinion. If I want to listen to a song about doing anything on the wild side, I'll stick to Motley Crue's song.",0

"Heartbreaking Humbling Song The first time I heard this song I almost cried. The second time I replayed it, I definitely did. Bart Millard does an amazing job in conveying Moses' internal struggle with God dealing with his role as a leader of the Jewish people to set them free from the tyranny of the Pharaoh.  Even though the song specifically portrays Moses' perspective during and before the Exodus, his insecure and confused state of mind is very relevant to anyone who struggles to see God and His love and affirmation for everyone despite our unworthiness. Really love this song!!!!",1

MUITO BOM OUTRA GRANDE INDICAO PARA O ESTILO ROCK ALTERNATIVO.  UM GRANDE CD DESSE ESTILO.,1
"Carved In Crap Until Tony MacAlpine was forced to form a hair rock ensemble in late 1990, the disparity between 1988's ""Children"" and 1990's ""Carved In Sand"" represented the single biggest drop off in quality between consecutive albums in the history of recorded music.  True, ""Children"" was an aberration - great music, good lyrics, perfect order, outstanding mix, lush orchestrations and tons of vision.  Never before had The Mission risen to that level and, sadly, never would they approach it again.  ""Carved In Sand"" has none of the aforementioned elements.  The titles alone betray the lack of ideas.  When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special, you know there's trouble.  ""Into The Blue"" isn't a half bad song until Reeves Gabrels shows up (and ruins it).  ""Butterfly On A Wheel"" suffers from boredom more so than anything.  I'd critique ""Sea Of Love"" except I can't remember a note from it.  ""Deliverance"" almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perhaps the most annoying guitar tone of its time.  The ennui resumes in ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" (check out Camel's ""Dust And Dreams"" for a slightly more compelling treatment of John Steinbeck's novel).  You're so disenchanted that by the 7th track, ""Belief"" you are momentarily deceived into thinking it's a good song.  However, 4 minutes into the 7 minute opus, when you realize you're just hearing the same idea over and over and over and over, well, the luster lessens.  I would later learn it's best to stop the CD after ""Belief"" because the spiral downward (with apologies to Trent Reznor) is steep.  Honestly, how can any song titled ""Paradise Will Shine (Like The Moon Tonight)"" be any good?  Answer:  it can't (and isn't).  I don't remember a thing about ""Hungry As The Hunter"" other than an annoying ""yeah, yeah!"" that followed every chorus.  ""Lovely"" I believe is a brief acoustic piece that feature's Hussey non-too-lovely speaking voice.  All in all, this is a terribly written, dreadfully performed, incompetently recorded (by Tim Palmer, of all people) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense.  The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an idea somewhere (1991's ""Grains Of Sand"").  It took me exactly 7 listens to decide The Mission had gone to hell in a handbasket and to eliminate it from my collection.  13 years later, I still hate every note on it (at least where there are notes to hate).",0

"Old school Korn sound for Christ This is one of the best songs EVER!!!! It's really nice to have HEAD start to sound more like Korn and be Christan as well. The only thing I have to note, is that the bass player does not play the bass the same as Korn's bass player Fieldy. But it's still awesome, the guitars sound the same as Korn. Just buy it it's only 99 cents and it's EPIC!!!",1
"I won't even listen to this on Prime Sorry, this just isn't a great album.  Most of them sound like they were done on an old Casio keyboard and just lack the majesty and grandeur that these themes deserve.",0
Love their music Can't get enough of this group.  I belly dance and the music is great to create choreographies for my dances.,1
Wanted to hate this song. I am a Korn fan so I really disliked Head for leaving but this song is awesome... Dang it... It sounds like old-school Korn with melodic vocals. Korn would sound so much better if head was back. They are awesome without him but they could be gods again.,1
"LISTEN! If you don't listen to this song, you're MISSING OUT! Head has such an awesome style. this thing rocks.
Head also changed his band's name to ""Love & Death"" Just in case you were wondering....",1

"If not for Cat Skills . . . This album would be a on a background playlist for a party instead of thumpin down the road with one awesome song.  Zoe rocks the tour, but they seem to be on the verge of just getting into the studios and mixing it up to a Bohemian lather once again.

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): David Bethany - True Love (Independent)
South Carolina singer-songwriter David Bethany has certainly earned his musical spurs. He's the ex-frontman of The Killer Whales (check out their 1983 album ""Emotional Geography"" - produced by Jamie Hoover), and he's shared stages with Bonnie Raitt, Richard Thompson, Johnny Winter, George Thorogood, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Molly Hatchet. They say variety is the spice of life and anyone who's been musically involved with such a diverse group of artists must like mixing it up. So it is on ""True Love"", where he employs island rhythms, ska guitars, Americana melodies and blue moves. His voice, somewhere between Jackson Browne and John Hiatt, is easy and likeable, and adds some classic `70s singer-songwriter flair to a collection of songs that feel personal and real.

Highlights come thick and fast. The title track makes an immediate impression with its Caribbean beat, hint of brass and a song (and vocal) that should be owning daytime BBC radio. ""Scotch for Supper, Cigarettes for Dessert"" almost lives up to its title, and features the most restrained and gentle of guitar solos; the sort of thing that JJ Cale would be proud of. ""Can't Hold On"" cruises dangerously close to perfection. An organ fed melody releases a country-rock groove, then a wandering trumpet mirrors the tune and takes it off to beautiful new worlds. It's an inspired three and a half minutes, and will undoubtedly be a massive hit in some as yet undiscovered parallel universe, where such things as genuine soul and tender, heartfelt songwriting are coveted.",1
Five Stars good memories,1

My friend took my account and bought a whole bunch of songs on here so I'll give them all a neutral rating, meaning: I'm not going to listen to the songs or do any research on 'em before I review.

Pumps up my Christmas lights! Great CD. Using a song as part of my family animated Christmas light show. Always can count on TobyMac for something different and fresh.,1
"Great Family Song This is a wonderful song by Matthew West that really touched my heart especially since I had already purchased the DVD, ""The Heart of Christmas"".  My favorite songs are ""The Heart of Christmas"" and ""One Last Christmas"" because they remind me of the brave little boy, Dak, who died of leukemia after a such a long battle.  This song tells of how a town came together to give this little boy one last Christmas to remember before he died.  I know I will play this song, the movie soundtrack and the movie, ""The Heart of Christmas"" during the Christmas holiday this year and all the years to come.  Always remember as one of the songs says to cherish each moment with your children, parents, and all your other loved ones as if it is the last.  Also, don't ever forget to tell them how much you love them, and don't take it for granted that they should know.  You never know when something might happen unexpectedly.  You don't ever want to regret not having said everything you needed to say to them while they are still here.  We all only have one chance in life, let's make the most of it, and cherish each moment like it is our last, especially with our loved ones!  Always remember the true meaning of Christmas is not getting presents, it's the  celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ!",1

Disc 2 is all different artists doing studio cuts such as Jackson Browne, Third Eye Blind, Fiona Apple Etc. and has nothing to do with Fleetwood Mac.",0
"Only the beginning to what we have to look forward to from this new artist! As a Christian music enthusiast, I often run across an individual or a band that has yet to be discovered by others. However, it is a rare moment when my ears are pleased and my heart is touched. On one such occasion I was relaxing at home watching ""Reflections"". Daystar produces this television program which showcases nature-loving videos with scripture notes accompanied with mostly instrumental melodies.

On this one specific night I had my eyes closed and suddenly this voice began to awaken and touch my soul. Then the message began to sink in and I had to rewind it to find out who it was. When they first started singing he reminded me slightly of Chris August but as the song continued it was more like the style of Jason Upton. It was melodically and lyrically beautiful. To my delight the person's name was a mystery causing me to speak to myself like I was Sherlock Holmes.

Kristian Binion was the answer to the riddle at that moment and God is the master of his talent. A graduate from Christ for the Nations International he learned early on what the significance of a close relationship with Jesus Christ brings to writing. With gifted musicians like Kari Jobe and others you have to wonder, what does this University instill in their students that other colleges do not?

I received his current EP, which sadly only includes three songs. The first single on the album is the notable song I heard that evening and title of the EP, ""Pieces"". It speaks about how fragile we are and how often times we don't feel worthy of repair. However, God sees us as a moldable project as He restores us and makes us new.

This song really touched my heart as I sit discovering this artist as he moved my spirit. It is so personal and speaks to those who have a broken and contrite heart. At some point we all experience moments of heartbreak and desperation. It could be the loss of a loved one or a feeling of rejection. It could also be backslider who was once close to God who has fallen and is trying to find their way back. All of these scenarios fit the message, along with many others I have not mentioned. The closing segment is one of the most powerful lyrics I have heard recently. ""When this world pushes my heart to break. But every piece of it sings your praise. If it takes falling to see your face, then somebody push me for Heavens sake.""

Kristian's heart is all about making God famous and hoping his worship will touch someone that needs to know that God is the answer to every problem they will ever face. We all have broken pieces or areas the world has vexed us in and if we turn everything over to Him, He can make something out of us to use for His glory. I have found myself asking God to keep me broken so that I never want to leave His side. Being near to God at all times is vital to our spiritual health and growth.

I cannot express to you how gifted this young man is. You just have to be inclined to discover him for yourself. I do believe that he has a huge future ahead of him musically and spiritually leading people in worship and to a closer walk with Christ through his ministry.

The second song on the release is titled ""Narrow Way"". This is a message that is urgent for the Body of Christ today and the title is exactly what it is about. Many people today are on the broad path that leads to destruction. They have been tossed about with every wind of doctrine and spoon fed grace to a point they feel a personal relationship and repentance is not required of them. Kristian lays his heart on the floor before the Lord in this beautiful adoration of a man desiring to exemplify Christ. ""I wanna say what you would say. I wanna love the same way. Until everything I do is a reflection of you. I will follow the path you've made along the narrow way. There's a ladder you can climb to pull yourself up to the sky. But you will be sure to find you will fall if you get to high. But that ladder it leads back down where the humble and broken are found.""

After listening to the third song ""Strong Tower"", I was extremely unsettled about the fact that there were no more for me to listen to. This song brought out a different sound from Kristian and I had a hard time deciding which I liked better. It was at that point that I decided God's perfect number is three and this EP is one hundred and ten percent fascinating. That being said I am looking forward to seeing what God has in store for this extraordinarily gifted young man.

Eager to see how long I was going to have to wait to hear more from Kristian, I asked him when he was going to bless us all with a full length album.

Kristian - ""I'm currently writing new songs to go along with a lot more that didn't make the EP. I am praying and believing God for a full-length record someday. I know it will happen in His timing. Meanwhile, I plan to start recording some acoustic videos of new songs that God has given me. Those should be coming very soon!""

As someone who is passionate about writing for God I asked what advice Kristian would share with others who have a dream to sing and minister and to share God with others in song.

Kristian - ""I would say don't ever let anything stop you! Not even yourself! I struggled for a long time with not feeling adequate or good enough. It wasn't until I surrendered to God and stopped worrying about what people thought. I started reading the word and seeking Him and God started dropping songs in my heart. I would tell God how you feel, ask Him to write through you. It may not come right away but God is faithful and He will begin to birth songs in your heart that will draw people to Him.""

Today you see a lot of youth struggling with choices either to fit in at school or with their friends outside of school. They are willing often times to sacrifice the gifts God has placed in them to use for His Kingdom for momentary popularity. As a young man himself growing up with the temptations and trials of youth I was curious what or who influenced him to lay everything at the cross and truly walk with Christ.

Kristian -"" I would have to say my Grandfather, V.R. Mitchell. I was going through a time in my life where I was not really living completely for God. I mean, I loved God and I knew how to act and knew what to say to make it seem like we were close. But in reality I was riding the fence. While I was visiting with my Grandfather one day it was like he knew exactly what was going on. But he didn't give me a speech or tell me I was a sinner. He just very calmly grabbed my hand looked me straight in the eyes as I was leaving and said ""Son, Grab a hold of Jesus and don't ever let him Go! That's all he said but it was all I needed! Instantly I knew it was God speaking through him. And I will never forget that moment the rest of my life! That is what I would say to a young person who is struggling to fit in. DON'T FIT IN! Grab a hold Of Jesus and don't ever let Go! It's not always easy and we are human. We will mess up. But don't ever forget to cling to Jesus it's the only way to make it.""

Kristian is right we are human and we all mess up, but one thing is for certain he did everything right on this EP. Check it out for yourself and take advantage of being the first person to share his music with someone else. Trust me when I say don't let someone else steal your blessing from doing so. I hope and pray that this review may open doors for Kristian to explore that full-length album because I personally don't know how long I can wait to hear it.

I would like to give special recognition for musicians, mixers and producers who made ""Pieces"" what it is. Thank you Daniel Lopez, Will Coleman, Josh Dufrene and Gregg Dunham for assisting Kristian by making this EP available. To order this EP please visit his website at [...]",1

Five Stars love it!,1
Love this song/ I love this song. I never heard it until this week. The lyrics are outstanding.,1
This is terrible. I feel like I've been had This is terrible. I feel like I've been had. theses are not the original artists and they don't even come close to sounding like the original artists.,0
"Misleading The track listing lists both the song and the name of the artist, which led me to believe it was the actual original recordings or at the very least the real bands. It isn't at all; it's someone trying to sound like these bands and not doing a very good job. Perhaps I should have read more about the product beforehand, but I also think it should have been clearly stated somewhere in the official listing that this isn't in fact ""various artists"" but the same artist pretending to be various ones.",0
"Not Original! Horrible remakes, in most cases.  Had I known these were not originals, and in some cases, not the original performers, I would not have bought this, or maybe just a track or two.  I suppose this is the risk of digital downloads.  :(",0
"Not ORIGINALS, but some not too bad These are definitely NOT ORIGINAL recordings although ""With A Girl Like You"" and ""You Really Turn Me On"" are close. Gerry Marsden and Eric Burdon are STILL GREAT, and you can clearly understand the words in the last verse of House of the Rising Sun. Also really good performances from The Swinging Blue Jeans and Brian Poole.",0

the ideas in this song reflecvt our insecurity People who like logic or a system for culling reason from life probably feel like this when a trickster has flooded the sacred meadow with contingency. The basic idea is about risk.,1
One Star why did i buy this,0
"Freakin' Fast First of all, I have been looking for this EP for quite some while so the fact that I got and for $4 was already a win-win situation for me. But what impressed me the most is I ordered this on March 8th; on a Saturday no less and I received it on March 10th. I was expecting to receive it within a week. But two days!! Wow. It was in excellent condition and new as advertised.",1
"Perfect album to play when unwanted relatives are visiting! Or your grandparents!  They'll love this too, send it to 'em.  Because why send them a card, when you can send them into cardiac arrest?

Actually, who COULDN'T love this??  With such heartwarming lyrics like:

""I wish I had a c***
I'd rub it in your face
I'd shove it in your mouth
You'd really like the taste
Then I'd STICK IT UP YOUR @$$,
SHOVE IT UP YOUR @$$,
RAM IT UP YOUR @$$!""

Needless to say, this album can't be taken seriously.  It's quite hilarious actually.  Hilariously bad.  You'll want to be completely alone when listening to this - or better yet - don't listen to it at all.",0
Great Electronic rock/metal Great band that was doing great electronic rock/metal. They broke up but their music still lives on and is great.,1

"Selling her talents for the consolations of fame Anna Ternheim's debut and her second album touched me deeply: I felt her sensitive lyrics and natural, fragile vocal style spoke directly to me as I wandered around Berlin. This was all the more so on the first album which was more acoustic and less bombastic than the second one. But already on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Separation-Road/dp/B000WC2US6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Separation Road</a>&nbsp;you could sense that Ternheim wanted to become a pop star.

So I wasn't waiting for The Night Visitor with bated breath. On German radio I happened to hear her play one track live - Lorelei-Marie - and found it awful. What's with the naive sentimentality and the oh-so-pretty vocals? Even Heather Nova or Sarah MacLachlan would be embarrassed to put that kind of oh-so-pretty triteness on one of their albums. And then came all the promotion - the website promising great things to come, the story of the album's genesis (being born during a power-cut, etc.) trying to - literally - spark interest in what is a thoroughly unimaginative album. The depth of feeling and emotional sincerity found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somebody-Outside/dp/B000CSUWPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somebody Outside</a>&nbsp;seems like a distant dream now.

Five Stars Beautiful music I simply love!!!!,1
"Two Words ""Best of Times"" is one of Sara Hickman's best cd's, from a different perspective.  It challenges the listener to actually listen to the words and music Sara has written and where she is going with it - not just listen to her beautiful, angelic voice.  For me, hearing Sara's songs sung by a different artist or group has definitely caused me to delve into deeper thought regarding all of her songs; not just the ones on ""Best of Times"".  Quite frankly, I can't think of a song Sara has released that has not been, how shall we say....""releasable?"" She is a true ARTIST in this world, bringing her own styles and ideas not only out in the lyrics but in he instruments as well.  She definitely goes out on a limb sometimes, but is always ready to defend herself with confidence. I don't know how all of these teeny-bopper / american idol type people make it to the top and earn millions of dollars.  So many of them are around for a season or two, then they are in rehabs, disappeared, etc. And where is all of the fame and fortune promised to them? In some other teen star or agent's pocket by now.  Stick with the REAL musicians, the REAL writers and you'll never be disappointed.  If you want to learn all you need to know about relationships, love, anger, friendship, disappointment, sadness, happy times, how to be silly and how to be somber....all of those emotions can be wrapped up and sung by someone in 2 words....'SARA HICKMAN'  She'll be around a lot longer than the spears, biebers or lohans, that I assure you.",1

Line up:
Bozena Mazur - vocal

Staszek Grela - guitars
Robert ""Los Agentos"" Lenert - harmonicas

Wladek Wiater - saxophones (track 11)
Romek Puchowski - dobro (track 12)
Slawek Wierzcholski - harmonica solo (track 18)
Marta Lis - vocal (track 15)

""Poza horyzont"" (Beyond The Horizon) is a second album of Los Agentos in that line-up. After the great ""Afrykanski Snieg"" (""African Snow"") it is the time for something same ""twisted"", but in a different way. African sounds are, maybe not totally removed, but mostly replaced by jazz. Again everything is thanks to Andrzej Serafin, who changed his African traps to different ones, for example... central heating stove (!  which,  as the musician claims, tunes in D! The recording is highly eclectic, full of intricate harmonic solutions and deep, warm tones. It is a real windfall  for every lover of the music which  you cannot classify anyhow but as beautiful one.  Serafin's genius is completed with Staszek Grela's soft guitar and nice, dark vocal of Bozena Mazur. But despite appearances the music is not easy to deal with. The recordings are filled with ambient, psychedelia, acid jazz and samples which makes mood of gnosis, mystery, soaring to the higher level of perception. For sure it is the best Polish album of the year! And just think that all that ""mess"" came to existence thanks to the concept that rose in the head of Robert Lenert, the band leader, and with this idea, there was beauty and new dimension of art to rise...

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Melia - Soundproof Walls (Independent)
A musician for just four years, Melia Kimberly Maccarone has already made serious inroads into a promising career. ""Soundproof Walls"" is her debut long-player, recorded with her band (Dominic Ciaccia - drums, Tim Latus - bass, Rob Cerame - guitar), with Melia responsible for lead guitar, vocals and the songs. That's quite a load for a 20-year old, but she seems completely unfazed, and her all-round performance is incredibly confident, leading her band through a collection of brash pop-punk and upbeat ska-rock.

The production on ""Soundproof"" is gloriously vibrant; the music almost leaps from the speakers. It's absolutely appropriate, as there's nothing lo-fi or half-hearted here. Melia's songs are focused and vivacious, falling somewhere between the navet and pop thrill of early Blondie and No Doubt's Jamaican infused bombast. Surely it can be no coincidence that ""I Wanna Be Your Girl"" brings out Melia's inner Gwen Stefani. It remains a highlight of the seven-track set, though there's no shortage of competition. ""Checking Out"" possesses a great vocal hook and serious guitars; ""Sleaze Parade"" is complex and technical, and thoroughly enjoyable. ""Stay"" indicates a talent for balladry, which might come in handy, should the mainstream come calling.",1

"Review of Electric Love Songs by John Lynch The following review is the result of extensive road testing on three different days and under different driving conditions, including suburban freeway, California coastline (both sunny and overcast), and suburban surface street.
The most striking thing about this record on a first listen is the strength and consistency of the songcraft. One after another the songs have catchy, hummable, moving, memorable tunes. ""Romeo & Juliet"" is reminiscent of the first original Lynch tune this reviewer heard (circa 1980), whose name is forgotten, but which sounded like an amalgamation of parts of five great lost Beatles songs all crammed into a single song; ""Romeo & Juliet"" also has more ideas than it needs, though the reference points here seem closer to Bob Seeger or Tom Petty or Thin Lizzy (see below), but it puts them together in a way that makes sense. Lynch's invention is equally effective in producing anthems, swampy rockers, folk-pop, and ballads. I've heard few albums by anyone on which the songs are so consistently effective; they are radio-ready exemplars of their respective genres without being generic, and one can imagine them being successfully performed by a number of different artists.
On a second listen one notices the lyrics. Rock music really does, to some degree, all sound alike; it's built on clichs. Most good rock music either transcends the clichs to find the original emotional force that motivated them, or acknowledges them with some degree of usually affectionate irony. These songs do both (a rare balance: Richard Thompson is another writer who has mastered this in his rock compositions). There are plenty of cars and girls and familiar rhymes, but Lynch recognizes their familiarity. In some songs, like ""Romeo & Juliet,"" the clichs are wallowed in and milked for all their resonant effect, though the song still manages to find a new image in the tried and true situation, such as Juliet's face illuminated by the brake light--viewed presumably in the mirror by the driver who is leaving her behind with someone else. One of the best songs on the album, ""The Best is Yet to Come,"" uses a device often used to good effect by Neil Young: mixing seemingly unrelated narratives and leaving the listener to figure out the possible connections. The haunting last line of that song (before the repeated chorus) is this reviewer's favorite of the album.
Many of the songs reference rock music itself, and particularly its relationship to time and aging (another Youngian theme). ""Black Irish Rocker"" salutes with affectionate humor the aspirations of all rockers for authenticity, regardless of race, creed, color . . . or age. The speaker is not a teenager hoping to grow up to be guitar god but a middle aged married man who at first wistfully imagines being reincarnated as Phil Lynott, the Thin Lizzy frontman who parodixcally combined two conventional signs of authenticity, blackness and Irishness, to renew what might otherwise be the most easily parodied persona in hard rock (Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher provides another aspirational model of achieving authenticity by defying stereotypes). Rather than trying to return him to reality, his wife encourages him not to dream such dreams but to try to live them. He confesses to her that ""it's been getting harder / to separate reality from the dream,"" to which, in a beautifully enigmatic detail, ""she smiles her little private smile to herself; / she says, `I know exactly what you mean.'"" There's a black Irish rocker in all of us who (to paraphrase Mr. Young) should not be denied.
The song titles suggest the larger theme of the album: ""The Best Is Yet to Come,"" ""Where Have All the Good Times Gone?,"" ""Rock `n' Roll Ghost."" This is classic rock about classic rock that asks how we should respond when we find ourselves 20 or 30 years on and still hearing its siren promise of ecstatic fulfillment. Some rockers burn out, some fade away into conventional adulthood, but some (think again Neil Young or the Rolling Stones) demonstrate that rather than seeming absurd in the old, sticking with rock in fact helps keep them young, which is to say it sustains in them a spiritual if not physical vitality as they grow and face age and ultimate oblivion.
More prosaically, but further evidence of the album's implicit argument, the playing is an impressive example of DYI ethos, with Lynch playing all instruments with tasteful economy, deploying a wide variety of guitar styles as called for by the particular situation, deploying a tambourine for just a measure or two (one imagines him waiting alone in the studio through the entire song to add that important detail), or walking a nifty bass line through the spaces in the plaintive ""Grace Hollogne."" Finally (and especially for personal friends), Lynch's vocals deserve mention. His voice seems to have deepened over the years into a seaworthy instrument weathered like the deck of a well-used and well-maintained wooden boat (perhaps a gift of what one hopes is a long-abandoned smoking habit); the timbre perfectly suits the songs, but more important is the singing itself, which uses its own restraint as a source of expressiveness and authenticity.
There are many forms of talent on display in this record--songwriting, lyrical cleverness, musicianship, production, singing--but the deep, solid mineral vein running through it is its awareness and renewal, in each song, of the power of this sort of music to keep an aging engine oiled and running.",1
"Great music with an awesome message! I have been blessed by Heather Williams music for years now. Starting with her first ""independent"" CD, and now through her latest, ""This Time Around"". With songs such as ""Hallelujah"", ""God Is Still God"", and ""Beautiful Thing"", and the other songs; it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this album!",1
"I purchased this for the flip-side ........ .............. and, having heard the song many times back in the seventies, wasn't disappointed.
I'm a devotee of REAL, TRADITIONAL country music; what I call ""seriously logistical"", not the Nashville-influenced ""really-lurv-ya-hurny"" sort of mass-market junk, nor the pestilential yodelling of the old-timers, which butchered many a fine traditional country song,and set country's cause back by decades.
""Nobody Home ........"" fits my tastes admirably.",1
"Not the Same Rendition of the Music as in the Movie - Disappointing I thought that this piece would be the same as in the movie ""Dr. Strangelove,"" but it wasn't. It's the same music, but not the same classic piece from the movie done by Marlena Dietrich. I was very disappointed.",0

"Gotta boost the star rating on this The idea here is that if you like Beethoven, you ought to like these other composers from Beethoven's classical era. It works for me. I already have lots of Beethoven in my collection, and lots of Mozart and Haydn who inspired Beethoven, and lots of Schubert and Weber who were the young up-and-comers weened on Beethoven. They're all here, along with Hummel, a very good but often overlooked contemporary, as well as Spohr, Sor, Cherubini, Kuhlau, Dussek, and Guiliani.

What this collection makes me realize is that although Beethoven is said be the composer who most bridged the classical and romantic eras, he really seems to me to fit more squarely in the classical era. Two of Mozart's final works, the Requiem and Jupiter Symphony, greatly foreshadow Beethoven. When Beethoven ""went retro"" with his 8th Symphony (did he invent musical nostalgia?), he seemed to be aping Haydn's Clock Symphony. And even two of Schubert's most romantic works, the Unfinished Symphony and ""Death and the Maiden"", are still very classically structured compared with what was to come next from Liszt, Berlioz, Schumann and on. And nobody in any era ever sounded like Beethoven's later most advanced piano sonatas and string quartets. This is very rewarding listening and all top class stuff as X5 usually is.",1
"If you like Beethoven you won't hear any in this album There is a lot of music here for the price, but it is written by Weber, Schubert, Haydn and others. Where's the Beethoven????? I bought this album and informed Amazon over 3 weeks ago that the title is a misnomer and there must be a mistake in the track selections. Nothing has been done about it yet. Is anyone else buying this album???",0

The 45 has the short version of Hold Your Head Up,"" and it almost seems like the long version was spliced right out of the short version (the long version had an extra long instrumental and you can almost hear where where it was ripped out!!)

One of the best lovesongs around Boyz to Men is one of the best harmonizing groups around. This is one of their best songs. If you love good music and harmonies I highly recomend this song and this group.,1
Excellent for relaxation/massage I purchased this for my sister in law who is studying massage therapy. It is perfect for this application as you can set your MP3 player for no delay between songs and it blends beautifully even when shuffled.,1
Prepare to be entertained. The song is creatively written and wonderfully arranged.  One cannot help but to start rocking and tapping toes to the music.  Spike Jones takes his unique humor and music and throws right in the fuehrer's face.  It does not get any better than this.,1

"The title song still brings a smile to my face, and reminds me we are to win the race and keep the faith. I am always encouraged when I listen to this album after so many years. It reminds me to keep my focus on Jesus as we grow in our walk of faith. ""We are striving toward the master and cheered on by the saints"". I first listened to the title song back in 1979 when I redeticated my life to the Lord. The title song is very special to me.",1

The person who did this seemed to be under the impression that the beauty of a wind chime does not lie in it's random, occasional tones.

"The cover art tells you 100% of what you need to know Know the phrase ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? Know how we generally extended it to cover art? Well friends, this is an album whose cover art tells you everything you need to know: A stock image of a sunset sky, with a cross overlay, with the words ""Christian Dubstep"" prominently plastered at the bottom with an ugly waveform graphic behind it, made basically invisible by the text. I was hoping that the producer was better than the graphic designer, but alas, they are not.

I was initially looking for the ""This is Christian Dubstep [year]"" series of albums I found while wandering the internet. The Amazon Music client led me here. I was particularly intrigued by the list of familiar song titles - ""Strong Tower"" by Kutless, a personal favorite, ""O Praise Him"" and ""History Maker"", two worship songs I sang in youth group, and of course ""How Great is Our God"", 2006's 'Trendy Christian song of the Year' award winner. This intrigue was evenly inspired by thoughts of ""I wonder how these songs sound as dubstep?"" and ""I wonder how much paperwork went into getting the acapellas for these tracks to make them?"" As I thought a bit more as my poky DSL line was buffering, I was like, ""wait...this probably won't end well"", and I was right.

The vocals on all the tracks are not original - they're either karaoke tracks or separately recorded - only the lyrics are the same. The tempo and sounds used have little variance between tracks; in many cases they're flat-out off-key. They kept the exact same progression of the songs as the originals. This can be a good thing, but it's clear that the only thing that changed between copy/pasting the 'dubstep' overlays was cutting out a measure here or there to match the different songs, rather than actually reimagining them.

I wouldn't necessarily call myself a true dubstep fan, but I do DJ for youth events, so I do spend plenty of time listening to a wide variety of Christian music. Christian music is its own topic of discussion and debate, but I generally find that they tend to be 'a genre behind' secular music. Just as Christian rock started to get good, the world shifted to urban/rap - and on the whole, the early Christian rap albums weren't that good. Christian rap started to get good - I'd dare argue 'better than secular rap' - in the past few years, just as the world has moved on to EDM and its cousins, 'dance pop' and 'dubstep'. While artists like Har Megiddo, Matthew Parker, and a few others do a half-decent job at making some tracks worth listening to (again, the 'This is Christian Dubstep 2012/2013/2014' albums also having a few gems), overall, I consider this album to embody the worst aspects of the Christian music business, genre, and culture.

I *very* rarely give single star reviews to anything, but when something is not only itself of poor quality, but is able to single-handedly illustrate literally every gripe I've had with Christian music in the past two decades, and the ""B-side cuts"" on other albums are better than the best that this one has to offer, that one-star is well-earned.",0
"Original Artists Should Sue! The original artists of these songs should sue this company - Relient K (Must have Done Something Right) and Kutless (Strong Tower) especially.  This album puts all the original songs in a horrible, horrible light!  I cannot even express how much the originals are ruined!

To call them a ""remix"" is NOT true.  These are not the original vocal tracks.  They are re-sung - HORRIBLY!

Check out the ""This is Christian Dubstep"" 2012 & 2013 albums for the real thing!",0

"Lord, have mercy on the Cedarmont Kids Apparently, poop, times poop, equals this.

The first track is a collection of fart sounds set in nauseating opposition to Enya-like synth.

The second track sounds like a bad impression of the Thompson Twins, horribly processed by an auto tune amateur. With mandatory wub wubs to qualify as dub step.

I could listen no further.

Cedarmont Kids: thou hath wrought an abomination. May God have mercy on your souls.",0
"So Ashamed I'm so ashamed of this production. I would've expected more from a Cedarmont Kids album--or a 10 year-old's IPhone. The original songs were stripped of their power and dignity through this ""dumb step"" remix. I would follow the money---if there IS any -- and likely find that a satanic conspirator has decided to burn the Christian hand that dares touch dub. I'm 56 years old and have longed for a powerful scripture-based dub step album. What a disappointment. This isn't even brostep. I don't see Skrillex or Deadmau5 running for their laptops at the sound of this album...they are safe -- very, very safe. No healing here; no deliverance here; no warfare; no revelation; no inspiration.  No dub. It's like a hybrid -- a sterile donkey -- the breeding of Praise and Worship with PseudoDub -- the offspring is completely neutered, de-spirited, misshapen, offensive.  Christian themes are well-suited to dub -- somebody PLEASE issue a global recall of this toxic product and get the real stuff on the shelves so we can resonate with the tones that subvert the darkest beats -- so we can attune to the waves that soldier us through each day -- bring the real Blood, the real Spirit.",0

Not the real version. Accidently downloaded this because the sample sounded like the original but it is not. Amazon needs to be more careful with samples because I would have sworn it sounded exactly like the Maroon 5 file.,0

Not Maroon 5 I was very pissed when I realized this wasn't the original song but rather a cover. No options to get a refund. This happened to me with several other songs before I realized that amazon sells Covers of songs and lists them under recommended. In some instances it was more difficult to find the song by the original artist than the lousy cover. I will no longer be purchasing songs from Amazon until they fix this nonsense.,0

AND IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! :( The guy singing the song is pitchy and the song is so kid friendly to the point where its aannoying!

Otherwise, alone, most of the tracks just seem to end before the number is finished.  I normally listen on shuffle  to hear a variety and these numbers that end short annoy.  But this is all i have against the album.  The vocals aren't great but add nicely to the overall sound.",1

I loved their EP, I wasn't a fan of the production on their 2nd album so never gave it much of a listen. I finally decided to give this one a chance and I have extremely mixed feelings on it. I believe this easily could have been their best work, some amazing music on this one but the entire album is plagued by absolutely cringe worthy clean vocal choruses. Now don't take me the wrong way, I'd say I have a very open ear for this kind of music. I love everything from Cannibal Corpse to MCR but this just really doesn't work for me. It's like throwing bands like Zao, Chimaira and Fall out boy in a blender. As much as I truly want to love this album, I don't see it staying in my library. Dissapointing listen.

"The back of beyond 'North Of The Border' was recorded in July 1967 and involves Duke Ellington performing as solo pianist with the Ron Collier Orchestra. The album was part of a project to showcase the work of Canadian musicians, and Ellington's presence was intended to give it some extra cachet.

The Canadian CD issue, released in 1995 on Attic, includes a 25 minute interview involving Ellington which gives some useful background information, as long as the listener is prepared to read between the lines. ""I never really think in terms of having the piano solo responsibility"", says Ellington. Asked how he liked having Ellington as his piano soloist, Collier responds: ""Oh it was a wonderful experience and opportunity Ted, but it had its frightening moments, I'll tell you!"" John Norris, a jazz writer and critic, is asked to give a 'quick critical analysis' of the resulting music. ""Now you really put me on the spot, Ted!"", he exclaims, before offering the expected platitudes. Putting it bluntly, if you haven't already got the picture, some of the music on this album is very undistinguished, and some of Ellington's soloing is inept.

I can excuse Ellington's ineptitude. He can be quite brilliant as a pianist who introduces, accompanies, fills or acts as a foil to another player. As he says himself, he is not really a soloist. Also, I suspect that more technically proficient pianists than Ellington might have viewed the prospect of soloing over some of this music as a thankless task. To quote Charles Mingus:

""You can't improvise on nothin', man. You gotta improvise on somethin'.""

Ellington's playing illustrates this point quite beautifully. On the pretentious and rambling 'Nameless Hour' Ellington is hopelessly and cruelly exposed. He fares only marginally better on the appalling 'Silent Night, Lonely Night' and there are moments in 'Aurora Borealis' when it sounds as if Ellington wishes the earth would swallow him up. His best effort is reserved for 'Song And Dance', a song that has a recognisable theme; something for the featured soloist to get his teeth into.

Ellington collectors might find items of interest here, as I have. Viewed as a whole, though, this is a pretty soulless collection. The group of featured composers allowed themselves to be labelled 'Third Stream', a movement attempting to fuse jazz and classical music. It appears that they were more interested in finding the Stream than in writing songs.",0

"Leicester Bangs Review (2012): Wess Floyd - Foxhole Confessions (Blind Roar/TIAM)
It seemed for a long time that The Replacements mix of punk attitude, power pop licks and unapologetic Americana had been and gone, and potential new torch carriers were decidedly thin on the ground. Of course, bands like The Hold Steady and The Gaslight Anthem changed all that, and now let's add Wess Floyd's name to the list. Not that he's a Johnny-come-lately by any means. His debut record (""The Daisycutters EP"") first saw the light of day as far back as 2006, and the most cursory of listens to ""Foxhole Confessions"" reveals a confident and able artist well practiced in his chosen genre.

Floyd's a talented writer, with his finger on the pulse of contemporary styles. That means although his songs are decidedly retro in feel, there's nothing old-fashioned or outdated about them. Perhaps that makes them timeless; I don't know, I'll need a couple hundred years to properly make sure. I do know that songs like ""Record Player"" and ""Williamsburg Nights"" deserve to be heard by lots of people. The former is an example of classic, rootsy Southern power pop. Killer hooks collide with crunchy guitars, a monstrous chorus and attitude aplenty. In a just world you'd be able to buy it on 7"" vinyl and wear it out on an old Dansette turntable, but you'll have to download it instead and use your imagination. As for the latter, it kicks in with a superb Stonesy riff before everything falls into place with soulful horns, lots of whoa-whoa backing vocals and Floyd's words, which bring to mind primetime Springsteen and Westerberg, and somehow merge New Jersey and Memphis into one.",1
This is a ravishingly beautiful collection by a remarkably gifted and capable musician This is a ravishingly beautiful collection by a remarkably gifted and capable musician.

"Kid-Focused Music that is fun for adults too We love her CD's because our daughter has enjoyed them since she was about 12 months.

"Low bit rate quality songs I bought 2 singles from this album: Tomorrow and I'll be waiting; both were under 201kbps in quality.
Tomorrow was 174kbps, and I'll be waiting was 200kbps.

Though I love Mini Page's music (originals), I'm very disappointed in these purchases. I've bought many other songs online, and none have been less than 320kbps.

I really hope that this situation will soon be rectified, because I would like to buy all her originals.

"Harry Partch's Gourd Tree (from the composer)

""Aphrodite Nights"" was composed for the gourd tree, a unique instrument microtonal instrument invented by Harry Partch, performed by Ryan McCausland.

Produced by Chris Opperman.
Recorded, mixed, and mastered by Stephen Kolakowsky.
Artwork by Tony Akins.
Recorded at the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair State University with special permission from Dean Drummond.

""Aphrodite Nights"" was composed for the gourd tree, one of many unique instruments invented by American composer Harry Partch (1901 - 1974).  The instrument was built on a bough of eucalyptus to which several gourds with bells have been attached, each resonating a different microtonal pitch.

While studying microtonal music at the Harry Partch Institute in Montclair, NJ, professor and composer Dean Drummond showed us some videos of gamelan music that I found to be very fascinating and I decided to compose something that was reminiscent of that style on the gourd tree.

As wonderful, imaginative, and flexible language is, and although words carry tremendous meaning, I often find it difficult to use words to truly attempt to ""explain the unexplainable."" The benefit of instrumental music is that you can communicate feelings and ideas with pure sound, from the world of the wordless into another plane, using music as a way to transport the listener into that plane.

One of the most powerful benefits of music is its ability to conjure up past memories and feelings, and remind them of the past in the present.

""Aprhodite Nights"" is about the wild magic of love and about those moments when two people become lost in one another, each partner being in awe of the other and giving themselves over completely to those feelings, exploring each others minds, hearts, and bodies with equal measures of caution and abandon.  Those evenings when time seems to stand still and that they are the only two beings in existence, subtly guided in their movements by instinct and by the power of the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite, love being the driving force behind existence and creativity.",1

"Enter the Trash-Can 2 Emulating the great Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton in their pursuit of ""furthest south"" I have decided to embark on a similar campaign albeit pejoratively: to identify the worst recording ever made.

In any such quest, Sir Roger Norrington is always going to feature prominently in calculations. In all fairness, the shockers in his discography (as known to me) are legion. His Haydn for instance is banal in the extreme; his Mozart is the musical equivalent of turbo-lax; his Beethoven is comic rather than cosmic; his Brahms induces nausea and felonious indeed is his Bruckner: other than that, he offers a welcome relief from vibrato, orchestral excellence and metaphysics for those so inclined. Much to his anguish, Roger the Hapless has been trumped in my estimation by Mehta whose bone-lazy Wagner lays claim to being Ground Zero (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-Hlts/dp/B0000026OJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring-Hlts</a>). The matter is still in doubt: black holes await investigation, one of them being Sir Roger's survey of Schumann's Symphonies with his long-suffering galley-slaves: the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (whenever I hear these poor devils. I rethink my position on euthanasia).

Here are ten reasons why this cycle warrants consideration in my quest.

1. 90% of the time, Sir Roger is metrical beyond a metronome. I sense that as a child, he underwent a formative experience with a brass-band from the local colliery: there is no other way to explain his ""oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa"" approach to rhythm.

2. Schumann's fever-pitch mania which is so integral to his psyche is muted in each performance.

3. Unrelentingly, phrases are clipped one after another. Roger the Hapless also spurns vibrato with his usual degree of dogmatism. In consequence, every bar is a test of one's stamina.

4. Geez, the strings of the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra are vin ordinaire with a vengeance. Listen to them in the slow movement of the Spring Symphony: it's moggy central - meow!

5. The Scherzo of the Second is the very definition of note-spinning. I yelled aloud ""FFS Roger - do something with the music!!! Do something! Anything!"" Alas, the great man was too busy worrying about vibrato to respond. Thankfully we all know there is more to this music than this banal account. The slow movement is equally vapid and shallow; not even a tadpole could survive in it.

6. There's no apotheosis at the end of the Second: it's just another fortissimo to Roger the Hapless.

7. Where is the barely suppressed excitement in the first movement of the Rhenish? How is such an omission possible?

8. Mysticism, it is safe to say, is not Roger's strong suit . . . As performed here, the fourth movement of the Rhenish has little to do with the consecration of a cardinal; it's more an evocation of chop suey.

9. Yes Veronica, it is possible to play the first movement of the Fourth as if it's in a major key: that's how little 'fear and loathing' Roger is able to generate.

10. The stupendous transition into the finale of the Fourth - Schumann at white heat - is mundane. It's an embarrassment to compare it with the likes of Furtwangler, Karajan, Szell and Kubelik.

Undistinguished as it is, this cycle offers no real challenge to Uncle Zubin's stupendous achievement: it's more boring and befuddled than sordid. Further afield, Roger's Brahms cycle on Hanssler is actually more horrific than this sorry affair - but who has the wherewithal to revisit such horror when life is so short? Not me! We press on.",0

Like the other Chris Zondaflex Tyler songs for kids, it's easy to follow because the song tells you what to do, and that's really helpful for the kids to learn and for adults who are trying to help them learn.",1

"From MainlyPiano ""Requiem 3"" is the third in a series of classically-styled piano solos by Canadian/Iranian composer/pianist Fariborz Lachini. In keeping with the theme (a requiem is a piece composed in honor of someone's death), the eight original compositions are slow, reflective, and melancholy, but this is not a dark or depressing album. Always graceful and elegant, this is some of Lachini's most beautiful and evocative music to date. A very prolific composer who has done a great deal of film soundtrack work as well as his own arrangements of Iranian folk and pop music, Lachini has a distinctive style that often reflects his own cultural influences as well as his European musical training - a true world musician! Fellow pianists will delight in the companion songbook, which is also reviewed here.

""Requiem 3"" begins with ""Farewell to Past,"" a somber piece that is sad but not without hope. The extensive use of trills enhances the emotional quality of the piece and gives it a more classical approach. ""Secrets and Dreams"" is strongly influenced by some of Chopin's nocturnes and is a favorite. The emotional nature of the piece touches the heart and evokes a deep sigh. ""Morning Light"" is delicate, hopeful, and very moving. ""Silent Truth"" again hints of Chopin's introspective melancholy with a slowly flowing left hand and poignant melody - another favorite. ""Shadows' Fate"" has a somewhat more tragic quality with an elegant melody and gentle left hand accompaniment. ""Embrace"" is slow, graceful, and very passionate. ""Dilemma"" beautifully conveys the emotional confusion of having to make a difficult choice. Very introspective and again very poignant, it's a wonderful ending to an outstanding album.

Fans of Fariborz Lachini will be thrilled with this newest release, and if Lachini is a new name for you, this is a great way to get acquainted with his music! Recommended!",1

The 4 bonus tracks are :
1) ""Earth Spirit"" - Australian aboriginal music meets boogie blues via the didgeridoo and vintage electric slide guitar.
2) ""Magnificent"" - caters to the Eastern influence, and has exquisite magical slide playing.
3) ""Blues For Gandhi"" - even more Eastern in flavor and has a strict Indian influence. This composition is performed with the musicians from Ravi Shankar, and features Gerry Joe Weise on opened tuned electric slide guitar, and Indian tuned acoustic guitar, much like John McLaughlin and Shakti !
4) ""Midnight Freestyle"" is a groove beat snare drum played with brushes, and has a question and answering situation between an ancient Dobro guitar and a vintage Stratocaster.",1

"Nina in 70's rock mode but it is Not worth the trip! Nina Hagen is one of my favorite artists. I have seen her perform at least 50 times in concert since she came out with Nunsexmonkrock in 1978 or so.  I have videotaped her performances and we have chatted through email. I do not like to disapprove of any artist's product, but this particular CD is not her best.  It has an old feel to it, like recycled 1970's rock, which would not be a bad thing if it was in any way interesting. But it is not.

The lyrics, all in German, may be compelling, but I don't speak German, so I cannot comment on their potency.  However, not knowing the meaning of the lyrics does not necessarily affect the appeal of the whole; other albums all in German are superb, e.g., Freud Euch (In English Bee Happy) In Exkstace (in English, In Ecstacy) as well as Angstloss (in English, Fearless) which has never appeared on CD.  But somehow, this album does not quite cut it.  After playing it a few times, I sold it on Amazon. One day, I may encounter it again and love it. But today is not the day.  This is also the only album of hers that I have ever sold.  All the others, I adore and play pretty regularly.  This one was not compelling.",0

In this case I hesitate to give a poor review because of the scarcity of extensive piano selections from the NFAMB. This particular album, while dirt cheap is heavy handed and joyless, also it is SLOW and unvaried piece to piece. Would love to hear someone like Gould or a modern player like Pletnev or Hewitt have a go at these simple pieces, which would benefit from a less literal interpretation.",0
"One Star you here crickets more than the wolves  very disappointin, don't buy",0
31 Minutes It's wolves howling for 31 minutes. The crickets are louder than the wolves. And there it is.,0
you get what you pay for :( Sadly the overwhelming sound of crickets prevents the sound I was hoping to hear...the howling of wolves. Thankfully it was only a 99 cent loss and next time...I'll read ALL the reviews.,0
"Only good by itself. I first listened to it on my iPod with earbud in and it was great, but when I tried to use it with my dock while sleeping my air conditioner drowned out everything but the crickets.  And other noise drowns out the wolves which is the whole reason I bought it.",0
"No Good I purchased this track because I love the sound of wolves howling and I figured, ""Hey, here's a whole hour of wolves howling, how nice."" Out of the entire hour you get about 7% howling spread throughout the track and cricket noises for the remaining 93%. Listen to the 30-second sample clip and hear how annoying those crickets are. That's what you get. The howling that you hear in the 30-second sample? That's most of the howling that is included in this hour-long track. They should have called this track ""Crickets Occasionally being Interrupted by Wolves"".",0

"Slack, listless refinement in Bernstein and de Falla To compensate for their minimal exposure on major labels since the Masur era ended, the NY Phil. has been hugely proactive in releasing Alan Gilbert's concerts on their house label. Every one of them seems to be available as MP3s, and one must admire the sound, which is very fine, all but miraculous considering the acoustic deficits of Avery Fisher Hall. How can it sound so ugly in real life and so lovely through a microphone? Here from October 2009 is #15 of thirty download concerts to celebrate Gilbert's first year as Music Director. The program is a crowd-pleaser featuring the Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, all but immortalized by Bernstein's own version for Columbia Records with this orchestra, and the stomping Suite No. 2 from de Falla's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat,which Bernstein also played the daylights out of.

It's both daring and nostalgic for Gilbert to follow in LB's footsteps, and I wish he had found some swing and sassiness in the West Side Story music instead of the polite, reserved, totally unconvincing performance he actually delivers.  It puts one foot ahead of the other in such a pedestrian way that I can only imagine what the old hands at the Philharmonic were thinking. This is music that defies polite handling - too bad. At least thee are some big, brassy sounds in the Rumble, but it's weak tea compared to Bernstein's knife wielding. conducting this dull is positively un-American.

The Falla is also too polite, lacking any sense of earthiness or flamboyance. This isn't even the Spain of tourist posters, much less of the country's most famous dance piece. There's really no point in detailing a mere walk through. The signs weren't good for Gilbert to light a fire under the Philharmonic, and the only bright spot is that the musicians and critics love him, apparently, which is a change from the dispiriting Masur and Maazel eras.",0

"One hit wonder. I always listen to my new music at least 3 times before I am willing to do a Amazy review. Learned my lesson over the last couple of months.

"One of a Kind This is one of the most needed albums in Christian/Praise music today.  The music not only serves as excellent praise but also contains an elegantly simple, yet deep and restoring message.

Out of the Deep is remarkably unique, being primarily a darker collection while remaining uplifting.  It meets listeners down at a place of unrest and brings them forward.

"Atmospheric and Meandering Electronic Single Came across this song in a trailer and just needed to have it. It's subtle and repetitive which usually equals boring, but this is a song that you just wrap around you.  The general vibe reminds me somewhat of Active Child, but not as complex. This song though just floats across the cosmos and conjures up grand houses now standing empty, standing on top of a mountain by yourself and something not quite natural. The basic piano line bumped up with tinges of electronic makes for a compelling and ghostly soundscape. Love.",1

"Overpowered by crickets I enjoy Technomind's products and have a large collection of their work.  I like the idea of a relaxing ""owls in the night"" audio track.  However, after hearing this track I would say it needs a little less of the loud crickets and a little more of the hooting owls.  Perhaps a peaceful stream with owls hooting would be better.  But for someone that likes crickets, they may enjoy this.",0

"Great performance, horrible digitized sound. In listening to inexpensive digital transfers of analog recordings, one notices dramatic variations in quality.  At one extreme there are superb items such as the Puccini Girl of the Golden West with Tebaldi, and at the other extreme is this poor transfer of the fine Forster version of the St. John Passion.  It is the worst I've heard--the sound level is VERY low, and even when the sound is cranked way up, it sounds muddy and unfocused.  It's awful.  I own the old LP Seraphim version from the 70s, which I remembered as sounding excellent.  I pulled out my much played LPs last night to make such I wasn't nuts--in fact, the LPs have beautiful, clear, detailed sound--they're just noisy from having been played a lot.

IMHO Amazon should withdraw this until something is done about the sound.  They'd be better off with a decent version of this for the same price as the 1964 Richter recording, to which it is rather comparable.  It's disgraceful to see this fine performance subjected to such mistreatment.",0

"Completes The Album This is a very welcome release.

I never thought of Ninth as a full album. Probably because I only found 7 out of 11 songs actually listenable. The others, however, were his best work ever!

And thats where this release comes in. Of the 6 songs, one is already on Ninth, and a further 2 are unlistenable. However, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, excellent, 5 out of 5 listening experience.

Most artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final cut. Because half the songs end up not very good. In the case of Ninth it seems, all the songs made it, but across two releases. I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'perfect album' as we see fit.

My biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some bad artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the annoying habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.

When he sings properly though, he has an excellent voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. However, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 instead of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.

'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been better, I rate it 4.

Then theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a perfect companion to the perfect 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Perfect. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.

All in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel complete. Peter's work has always inspired me, and I'm so relieved that my confidence in his latest album can remain unscathed.",1

"Splendid, highly recommended. We play Christmas music non-stop from the day after Thanksgiving to 12th Night and have an extensive library of Christmas music from which to choose.

This year we choose to seek out new tracks that were either Celtic/Olde World influenced  OR  weren't simply another rendition of the old standbys.

Barra MacNeils ""The Christmas Album"" and ""The Christmas Album II"" provided some great selections. We chose to buy selected tracks and I'll not comment on those we excluded, only the following tracks which we did indeed purchase.

01 - Children's Winter - three stars
.....Pleasing, new to most song. Plays better (for me) as a variation after having been listening to other, more familiar or lively songs.

02 - God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen - five stars
.....A good, traditionalist rendition of a Christmas classic. Gentle vocals, well harmonized and reverently (as is appropriate) performed. Nice 'Celtic' instrumental lead out.

06 - Christmas Comes But Once a Year - four stars
.....Easily meets the 'Celtic Influence' requirement. A real toe-tapping, corner pub song. Enjoyed by all.

07 - Christmas in Killarney - five stars
.....Another 'Celtic' selection. One of the two best songs from the disk - Great song, great recording. Great fun, enjoyed by all.

10 - Galacian Carol - three stars
.....For a non-traditional instrumental, this track plays ok.

11 - O' Come Devine Messiah
.....If you're looking for a secular, happy holiday track then you need to look elsewhere.
.....However, if like me your Christmas is a ""Jesus is the reason for the Season"", this is a MUST HAVE track. Multi-part a'capella rendition of an olde world Advent favorite. Perfect.

All in all we're very happy with the selections from this disc and recommend them '...to one and all'.",1

"Disappointed, but Not Surprised While the official soundtrack to the game, Might & Magic Heroes VI, is well made and packaged; it was disappointing when I realized that the song from the game trailer (the reason that I bought this soundtrack) is not included. This was a deal breaker for me. It's too bad because the music on the trailer is awesome.

Anyways, there is another odd quirk about this soundtrack. None of the songs have endings. Every song just stops abruptly in mid-stride. I believe it's because these songs are intended to loop indefinitely during game play. However, producers normally provide 'completed' songs on their soundtracks. Nevertheless, this may appeal to some that want to loop the music in the back ground while reading. So, I'll give it one thumb up.",0

"Leicester Bangs Review (2011): Blue O'Connell - Choose The Sky (Independent)
In 2009, after many years suffering loss of hearing, Blue O'Connell had cochlear implant surgery for her left ear and received a new digital hearing aid for her right ear. Since then O'Connell's busied herself teaching music from her unique perspective and recording her new ""Choose The Sky"" album.

She's a wonderful guitarist, taught by Robert Fripp, no less, and her words are intelligent and moving. You can hear her deafness in her voice, though it's a minor distraction, and combined with gentle finger-picked strings, the effect is always profoundly musical, though not always easy to categorize - like a babbling stream or finger bells, or some ancient `60s free folk design.

Nevertheless, her songs follow narratives and are written to share her stories and experiences. The title track, which also opens the album, sets the tone quite brilliantly, and just in case you've not been paying attention, the records ends with ""To Belong"" which features a lyric that pulls no punches whatsoever. In between you'll find much to love, not least instrumental tracks like ""For the Lily Grows"" and ""Owl's Dream"", both of which are just astounding - like hearing a long lost Davy Graham session for the first time.",1

Not as good as original I like the track.  Just not this version. Hard to top the original version.  But I'm like that with most things.,0
"After two solid releases what happened? Let me start out by saying that the predecessor to this album, A Violent Emotion, is probably one of my five favorite electronic albums, so I didn't expect this to be able to top it.  However, I never expected it to fall so short, either.

The first track, 'A Nice Place to Visit', kicks off the album rather abruptly with a harsh scream over a pounding beat, but it's pretty much downhill from there.  As soon as the main vocals started I immediately knew this album was going to be a disappointment.  I loved the vocal style on AP's first two albums, but I have to say that on this release they are much hollower and far too weak to pack the same aggression as before.  I read a review somewhere that joked about Daniel Graves having his vocal chords replaced with a frog's, and honestly I can't think of a better way to describe it.

  Then the clean vocals start and made me want to stop listening altogether.  On AVE, the clean vocals were well planned, strong, and worked to perfection.  I honestly don't know what to think about them on this album (see example the title track...), but they seem out of place (and in the wrong genre).  I definitely would consider them a bad move.

  Lest you think the shift in vocal style is my only reason for giving this album a 2/5 (I would rather have given it a 1.5, but that's not possible so...), rest assured I have more problems with it.  The melodies and synth lines are dull and repetitive, sounding like slightly harsher cookie-cutter riffs from some dance track.  The music itself seems to have lost most of its edge, just like the vocals.

  Overall, when listening to this album I continually get the sense that the songs are trying so hard to be as dark, aggressive, and energetic as the cover art would suggest, but in the end they just fall short in every way.  If I had to pick a favorite track, it would probably be 'The Devil's in the Details', as it reminds me of 'Spit It Out', the opening track from AVE.  Honestly, if you're a fan of AP, be prepared for a disappointment, and if you're not a fan (yet) I strongly urge you to start with AVE or the first album Close to Human.  Both are far better than this one.",0

"No one sang like Dusty Springfield No one sang like Dusty Springfield.  She was one of a kind, and the duet with Burt Bacharach was fabulous.  It is too bad she never recorded it in a studio to drown out the audience, but it is an awesome recording.",1
"This is a must I love this song Burt Bacharach starts it out very slow playing just the piano , but then Dusty joins in with her trademark voice and more blonde locks than I've ever seen . This song was never on any of her studio albums , or on any collections or best of CD . You will find it only on this DVD that's how rare a gem this is .",1

"A total flop I've been a Gloria fan ever since the release of ""Eyes of Innocence"" and ""Primitive Love"" (credited to Miami Sound Machine), and I've observed Gloria mature over the decades, and I've grown a huge fan of the latin music scene (and culture) thanks to her. However, having admired great song like Words Get in the Way, Conga, Oye Mi Canto, Here We Are, Cuts Both Ways, Can't Stay Away from You, Rhythm is Gonna Get you, Destiny, Steel Your Heart, I'm Not Giving You Up, Mi Tierra, Oye, Cuba Libre, Wrapped, Te Amare', No Me Dejes De Querer, Ay Ay Ay Amor, No Llores, and many others, I can't help but say that this album has nothing worth listening to. Gloria might be reaching out for the younger generations, but she is definitely losing some of her old fans. So, let's wait and see how the album does on the market. If sales are good then she has done a smart move to survive, and there will be no harm in losing some old fans on the way. If sales are bad, then she will have lost both.
P.S. Wepa is the most irritating song I've ever heard.
Let's Get Loud is a total waste of time and money. Absolutely no point in doing this cover of JLo's song.",0

Been listening to Ramsay since circa 2003 or so.
Larry Buys is a bad mofo of an album.
My favorite of his, easily.

"Return of the Dresden Doll! This release is not without its virtues. The sound is excellent, as is the orchestral work (listen, for example, to the growling lower strings at the end of the first movement of K. 491). There are also some rather interesting cadenzas here, paricularly Faure's fascinating (if anachronistic) cadenza in K. 491. The booklet notes are fine. The author points to the dramatic operatic qualities of the works, paricularly the aria-like quality of the slow movements. And these are the qualities missing from these neat, prettified performances. A friend of mine once aptly observed that Mozart pianissimos should never sound like Chopin's, which is precisely what Primakov's soft-focused playing suggests. To my ears the softness of his touch combined with a reluctance to play anything above a piano produces deadly results. I started with K. 491, and the first movement went reasonably well.  The trouble began with the slow movement, played at a somewhat slow tempo (no problem) and at exactly the same muted dynamic level throughout. It sounded like cocktail music to me. The finale was also slow and also lacking in drama. The beautiful dialogue for piano and oboe made almost no impression because it sounded just like everythinjg else in the movement. For comparison, I turned to Richard Good's excellent performance with Orpheus. What a contrast Goode's clear, focused sound was to Primakov's dreamy tinkling. Still, this performance was superior to that of K. 503.  Once again, the opening movenment was satisfactory.  But the last two movements were awful. The slow movement is ""dreamy,"" the trills barely audible, and any operatic quality entirely lost. The finale was dreadfully dull, with Primakov playing one passage after another without the slightest sparkle or drama. I was disheartened, but I went on and found the last two concertos equally sweet, pretty, and boring. Judging from the excellent reviews this release has received it seems that many people like their Mozart played this way. For such listeners, the present release can be safely recommended, for Primakov's playing is unfailingly ""beautiful."" But if you like your Mozart played with passion and drama, you should go elsewhere.",0

"Refreshing! Just got a copy of the Darrow Chemical Company CD ""A Nightmare on Seventh Avenue"".  This album is very refreshing as it does not follow the mold of current music; be it punk rock or other genres.  In this digital age, recording all sounds the same but this album has character both with the actual song writing and the recording.

This album is well thought out with lyric writing, music/riff structure, and packaging.  If you ever want to listen to some punk rock music with its own feel and tells a great hard-luck story, this is for you!!!!",1

"A fantastic album from a disappointingly short-lived band I saw The Still Voice at the anti-pop music festival years ago in Orlando and was hooked. They made a few other appearances locally and put out an EP a bit prior to this album, but sadly split up soon after. The music is fuzzy, rocky, trip-hoppy, complex, and occasionally reminiscent of the Kidney Thieves (maybe with a somewhat grittier texture). Erin Solari is a fantastic vocalist, and I'm hoping her upcoming solo project picks up where this album left off.",1
He's been wandering... off a cliff. This song is quite bad. There was a music video for it on YouTube in which Mark Weber defaced an entire cemetery's worth of tombstones with his fists.

"Worst Song Of The Year If there is a song worse then this one released this year then I have yet to hear it.  The entire song is just ridiculous.  From Jeremih phoning in the chorus, to the beat that sounds just slightly  off, to the weird voice that Plies is using throughout the song, Just The Tip wreaks of awfulness.  The content is also asinine (or in the words of Stephen A. Smith.....asitwelve). I can't even believe Ludacris agreed to this feature.  He must have been drunk,high, or got a fat check but even so he sounds very uninspired...and really who could blame him???  This song doesn't deserve to exist let alone be sold for anything other than free.  Horrible.",0

"Homage retro at it's best Jimmy Hinson is a modern day 8-bit genius.  I was a fan of his work on the Mass Effect 2 sound track, but was made aware of this album after Desert Bus for Hope 5.  I've been listening to it ever since and have relished it's nostalgic feel.  Authentic 8-bit feel is hard to capture, but Jimmy gets it in it's most basic form, and the remixes are in such rare form that they rival the top of the pop lists.  I would buy this album again in a heartbeat for all it's energy and the journey that it took me on as a listener.",1

But I logged on to say that this one song, Sri Krishna Govinda, I have set as my message/alert tone and I just love it.  It has melodious chimes that you can HEAR, but is so lilting and lovely it's not jarring, doesn't disturb others.

BTW, there's another free song I downloaded that I'm using as a ringtone and alarm tone:

"Not any recognizable form of ""trouble so hard"" I love ""trouble so hard"" in the original folk version or the Moby version as Natural Blues.  This music bears no relation to the song I can see... a bunch of hissing turntable flipping, no song, no melody.  If you want some techno club music that just sounds generic and unidentifiable, it's OK.  I didn't.  After nothing happened for 3 minutes I fast forwarded through it, nothing ever happened as far as I heard.  I wasted $1.59.  The only time I have bought something on Amazon that was nothing like I expected.

If you know the performers and what they do, maybe you'll love it.  If you want the title song, you won't.

UPDATE:

OK, I missed it.  The vocal from ""Trouble So Hard"" starts at 3:26 and runs more or less straight until about 4:17, then resurfaces garbled until about 4:27, then is there under the overlay of club music to about 6:00.  So about 1/4 of the track has apparently a copy of Vera Hall's recording of ""trouble so hard"" in it.  After listening to it a half dozen times, it's sort of growing on me..but I start at 3:26.  I'd still much rather have a straight recording of ""trouble so hard"" instead of some of the song wrapped over around and under with club music, but since the sample piece was club music, it's my fault.  Anyway, that's what you get!",0
Terrible version There are much better versions of this song.  This one is not good.  The concert they did with Earth Wind and Fire was so much better.,0
"Lord YOU Reign Shirley Murdock opens this recording ministering from Rev 4:4,10-11 according to the NKJV Bible translation.  She then moves into lyrics of worship edifying the Lord's position within - Lord you reign in majesty.  Lord you reign victoriously - A true testimony and reminder to all believers 'who' reign - [The Lord].",1

"Classic song done in a classic style I grew up hearing these old tunes sung by my mother, aunts and uncles.  They're all gone now, but the songs live on.  It is nice to hear new renditions of tunes like this.  It brings back many fond memories.  If you enjoy the pop music style of the 20s and 30s, you will like this recording.

Brava, Miss Rose!",1

A GEEZERS REVIEW Could it get any better? the second installment of the Dark Crystal Sword Sage WELL DONE. Keep up the excellent work Sara and guys Great writing and composition. This is what symphonic metal is all about,1
"Academic insider's music I cannot figure out Finnissy. His is winding seemingly disheveled and dissonant music with little obvious structure. Certainly his music is more intended as impression rather than developmental progression. This is supported by there being no format: no sonata, no quartet, no concerto, no symphony, etc. Simply pieces that do not connect with any other movements.

There are bases of logic to the works, however clouded and non-relatable to the layman as they are. Traum des Sangers is based upon a sketch by Caspar David Friedrich depicting a sleeping muse and angels above him. The notes say that the work represents this as two sound worlds, one of the real dreamer, the other of the surreal/unreal celestial element, oddly with the latter musical unit being more clearly structured (more real) than the former. The notes ask ""Who is dreaming who?"". The piece entitled WAM, which are the initials of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, reportedly works fragments of several of Mozart's works which are distorted, though they are so distorted that I can hear none of it. The liner notes refer to several quotes of Mozart: ""In order to be a success one would write stuff that is so inane a carthorse could sing it, or so unintelligible no sensible person could be bothered to work it out"", etc. These quotes represent existential struggles that Finnissy grappled with, whether Mozart was always great, the end-all-be-all one who intimidates composers who follow.  This all suggests that Finnissy was grappling with the accessibility of his own music. But all this results in a piece that is lethargic and aimless music. Mars + Venus considers a Reubens painting of the same name, featuring a man and woman. Finnissy apparently then considers the Mars and the Venus (apparently because of the male-female dichotomy) within us, which are not separable but interact and add. So the piece warps feelings of war and love, again as some non-forward moving, non-developing cloud.

There are numerous discs available with Finnissy's music. So somebody in the academic music community likes him. But you have to ask the age-old question of music: who is it for? Intellectual insiders, or the greater world? Or does an artist create out of what he/she needs to say, without regard to anything else? Certainly the latter is a given. But then don't expect the public to come along. As a layman, I found this disc unsatisfying with nothing that was said understood.",0

"At last - and worth the wait! At last there is a decent recording available of Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece: Moby Dick. It's been a long time coming but it is well worth the wait.

The singers chosen for the solo parts (Ishmael/Ahab) are highly skilled (a requirement for this work). But they also add a strong stamp of character, making the music vividly alive. We can sympathize with Ishmael's wonder and amazement; we shiver with horror and awe at Ahab's ravings; and the tragic role of Starbuck brings tears to our eyes with its stunning pathos. This isn't just a recording - it is a performance. An excellent program of a very difficult piece of music. You will have a new respect for Bernard Herrmann after listening to this.

This reviewer has the opportunity to study the original score in the Herrmann archives at Santa Barbara. This is not an easy piece to play and demands a high quality of player and conductor. The Danish National Orchestra and Choir more than meet those requirements. Under the leadership of conductor Schonwandt, the ensemble delivers an electrifying rendition that holds you spellbound through the entire work. This is not a dull, run of the mill product. Not in the least.

The quality of the recording is just as stunning as the performance: the sounds are clear, powerful, and well defined. It is a pleasure to listen to at all levels.

By all means, if you are a fan of Herrmann's film scores, don't miss this opportunity to hear one of his best off-screen creations. It is a shame that we had to wait more than 36 years after the composer's death to hear it - but it is well worth the wait.",1
"On balance, the preferable version It almost goes without saying that this version lacks the authority and ""definitive""ness of the original recording, since that was conducted by the composer. Who, unlike a lot of composers, was as good with a baton as a stave, if not better, especially with 20th century music. As an example, Bennie was doing Ives long before that Bernstein fellow kicked off the Ives rush in the late 60's. But the performances here are close enough to the original for chemistry (as my physicist friends say) and the sound is far better--clearer and with xlnt dynamic range. I tried 3 different LP's of the original and the big tuttis (particularly the Amen) overloaded the grooves of every one. Turned out the main problem was the master tape because the CD wasn't much better. This one is.",1
"Anti-Islamic Polemic When one studies the foundation of a religion, it is best to approach it from a believer's perspective. This helps one to understand why one follows the faith. It also strips away from misapprehension. This mp3 has been created by someone who opposes Islam and has several passages full of condescending, patronising and misleading information about the religion.
If you wish to listen to an audiobook, i would recommend the foundations of Islam by Hamza Yusuf. A noted scholar with over 20 years of studying the principles of his faith and widely regarded as one of the foremost American Muslim scholars in history.",0

"For Scorching Guitar Enthusiasts I grabbed this low-cost MP3 intro to Buckethead on a whim and am glad I did.  These cuts probably only appeal to scorching guitar enthusiasts, but they are fun listening.  I particularly like the second cut ""Look Up There"" for the slow build up.  To my ear the solo sounds like an extended version of Jimi Hendrix's classic rendition of Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"".  The first cut is also good but doesn't have the full 20-minute build.",1
"Loud and Heavy Wow. This is a good one that Amazon recommended and freebied to me. Most songs are loud and heavy in the manner of Nirvana, Kyuss, Stone Temple Pilots and maybe some more metal and even acoustic mayhem thrown in for good order.

"Some good pieces, but mostly forgettable This is the second disc of the 4-CD Sensual Classics by George Mann that I've reviewed and, as before, it's an uneven collection.  While he get's a couple of the pieces spot on (more than on Disc 3), mostly the performances are lacking in emotion or flawed.  If you're not expecting much considering the price, you may not be disappointed.  Schumann's Romance:  you don't feel Schumann's romance for Clara Wieck, his soon-to-be bride, for whom this piece was likely written.  Poulenc's Les chemins d'amour:  pleasant, but lacking in charm.  Beethoven's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata:  this is described as a grand expansive movement.  While the performance has its moments, it lacks grandness or expansiveness.  The approach is mostly lacking in heart.  Puccini's Doretta's Dream from La Rondine:  fails to conveys the notion of true love & passion.  Tchaikovsky's None but the Lonely Heart:  lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for.  Grieg's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic:  lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another.  Massennet's Elegie:  strikes the right note here.  Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana:  beautiful serene piece played too heavy handed.  Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-Flat Major:  low notes lack clarity.  Piano almost sounds like an organ.  Brahm's Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 39, No. 15:  OK, has some dance-like rhythm to it.  Rachmoninoff's Variation No. 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini:  best cut on CD.  Bizet's Habaera from Carmen:  OK.  Has some rhythm and variety of touch.  Ravel's Pavane for a Dead Princess:  fine.  Mozart's Romanze from Andante from Eine kleine Nachtmuzik:  lacking in Viennese suavity.  Satie's Lent et douloureaux from Trois Gymnopedies:  appropriately dreamy.",0

"The Only Digital Recording, Spoiled by Drum Addition As far as I know, this BDAA 2007 Festival of Russian Music CD, available at Amazon, contains the only commercially available digital recording of Vera Gorodovskaya's exquisite ""At Dawn"" (a.k.a. ""At Dawn, Sweet Dawn""), which I first heard on the 1970 vinyl stereo album, ""The Fabulous Osipov Balalaika Orchestra,"" Angel/Melodiya SR-40120 Stereo. That recording was so strikingly beautiful that I have been trying, unsuccessfully so far, to get it digitally reproduced to keep it from disappearing into the limbo of unpreserved and no longer available vinyl recordings. Recently, in another try at a computer search, I was overjoyed to discover this 2007 digital recording made for the BDAA Festival.  When I played it, I was intially pleased that someone recognized the unique beauty of this piece enough to do a more recent recording of it.  But as the performance progressed, I was horrified to find that someone had added an entirely inappropriate trap drum beat, completely ruining the ethereal, poignant, soaring richness of the piece as played by the Osipov orchestra. The composer, Vera Gorodovskaya, was a performer with the Osipov orchestra, which leads me to believe that the Osipov version would be the most authentic - I have no idea how the drum got to be added. I can only hope that, in the future, a new recording will restore the original stunning orchestration and interpretation of the 1970 recording.",0

"Very, very good debut. I'll be honest, I found nothing original about this band but they are at the top of their game at what they do. There are plenty of melodic hard rock/alternative metal bands out there that sound exactly like this, e.g, Red, Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, etc. But these guys pull it off just nicely enough to put it right next to those bands separated from the generic stuff like (most of) Thousand Foot Krutch, We As Human, recent Decyfer Down or recent Skillet.

One thing that caught my attention is that there are no ballads to be found, all of the songs are melodic, some with a bit of an edge over the others but nothing that takes you out from the music, kudos for the consistency they showed on this very, very good debut. Hopefully, these guys will keep making music. 4 stars",1

"Beware Although the description doesn't say it, one of the reviews implies that this is a video. I have seen the video and enjoyed it greatly; the soundtrack only--what is offered here--is noisy (the natural sounds of the onlookers and others) and was not so enjoyable to me.",0
"robotic pianism As with his other 'performances,' Colombo records mechanically perfect renditions of the pieces on an electronic piano.

"""Once again now!"" BELAFONTE (LPM-1150), taped by RCA VICTOR in mid-August '55, was Harry's second LP and his follow-up to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MARK-TWAIN-OTHER-FOLK-FAVORITES/dp/B0018GFCH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MARK TWAIN & OTHER FOLK FAVORITES</a>. It's a terrific set of songs produced by Henri Ren&eacute; that features Harry's usual guitar accompanist, Millard Thomas, plus Tony Scott's orchestra and the Norman Luboff Choir. Musicians include Maynard Ferguson, Bud Shank and Jimmy Guiffre.

Three of these tracks were wittily parodied by Allan Sherman on his 1962 WARNER BROS. comedy debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MY-SON-THE-FOLK-SINGER/dp/B000RLLBQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MY SON, THE FOLK SINGER</a>. These are ""Matilda"" (My Zelda), ""Jump Down, Spin Around"" (Pick a Dress o' Cotton) and ""Water Boy"" (Seltzer Boy).

Belafonte receives lyric credits on ""Gettin' Up Mornin',"" ""Troubles,"" ""Noah,"" ""Jump Down,"" and ""Suzanne."" The album's most famous song, the touching ballad ""Scarlet Ribbons,"" was actually recorded in 1952. After Harry toured with it for four years, that old ""Ribbons"" take was included on this Billboard-topping LP. The set-closer, ""Sylvie,"" was written by Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter). Although he's not credited on the LP, Leadbelly also originated ""Pick a Bale of Cotton."" (NOTE: One person going all-out could not possibly pick a bale in a single day.)

The general mood here is one of sadness. Even the few upbeat songs have a worrisome undertone: Matilda absconded with the cash; Noah had to build that ark for a rainy reason; Gettin' Up Mornin' is a date with Judgment Day; Jump Down and sweat a pail of water.

Some one check the price tag! I love Norton Buffalo and would love to have this album but there is no way in hell I would spend 10 grand to buy it when Norton's website sells it for $15.,0
Well This is a great remix of the song however in this version there is no vocals from Britney. If you really want the right mix just get Britney Live In Vegas.,0
"Thunderstorms I like this one very much and use it often when I can't fall asleep at night.  I love the sound of a thunderstorm, just something about storms has a calming effect on me.  I would recommend if you enjoy  hearing rolling thunder.",1
"Moving Bass I'm a music instructor, and I'm always looking for challenges for myself and my students.

One of my students has been learning bass. Bass parts can be very boring (in the songs she was picking out at least!)  This song is not!

 I challenged her to learn this bass line *and* play it this fast. I did help her by writing it out first. I challenged myself to learn the bass part also as well as the fast chord changes.  My fingers didn't like me, but I loved being able to play this with her.  Our winter recital was cancelled, so only her family heard us, but that was enough.",1
my new fav song I hit the replay button frequenlty with this song. Definately one of Frank Ocean's many cool songs. Can't believe I didn't hear about him sooner. I've been living under a rock!,1
"Beautiful and deep song A very deep and thought provoking song, which sometimes is improperly interpreted (in my opinion) as a suicide song. The song is about choosing between standing on the shore of loneliness, desperation, and denial, or giving in and letting yourselves be swept into the depths of passionate love. And I know from experience that, if you are going to fall in love, it's far better fall completely in and be swept away...",1
"Good Song A good traditional folk song covering the Peshtigo Fire.  Definitely worth the MP3 music cost.  If you care for folk music at all or are a history buff of the Peshtigo Fire, buy this song.",1
"Jesus It's all about Glorifying God in everything we do.  He AAAAA Able! Jesus is the truth, the way, and the life!",1

Bang the Drum This is one of my favorite dubstep songs ever! It has lots of beat and catchy tunes! A must have!,1
"good work Who is this guy and does anyone know if he has anything else out?  This EP is evocative without sounding tired or redone.  Can't get the MLK song out of my head.

Trying to place where I've heard the guitat sound in ""After the Night"".  Sounds familiar.",1
"I just don't get it Better Than Ezra is one of my favorite bands, but I'm sorry, I hate releases like this one. The intro track is not even a song. The 2nd track a throw away less than 2 minute track not only about a subject of very little interest to me (College Football), but about a specific team in a geographic region very far from mine. The third track at less than 3 minutes is more like a commercial jingle than a song. The 4th track a country cover that nods at the previously mentioned college football team. Then, finally a decent track ""Hey Baby"" after half the record is over. ""This Time Of Year"" you already purchased on the Greatest Hits release. ""Hell No"" you already purchased on the Paper Empire release. The last track which is by far the lamest tribute to the college team of interest includes a puke inducing rap. I know the band is pandering to their hometown, but for other fans, this is an insulting release. If you're content to being a college bar band, keep putting out stuff like this.

Download Hey Baby, and leave the rest.",0

"Turn off the Light! Although I am a huge fan of Guiding Light, I must say that this particular ""rendition"" of its theme left me feeling cheated! That particular theme, a beautiful composition, is raped, pillaged, burned, and buried by whomever recorded this version! It is only a shadow of its former self, and not a very good one at that. So I would say to anyone considering purchasing this monstrosity: ""QUICK, TURN OFF THE LIGHT!!""",0

"there is nothing Zombie Apocalypse about this album!! there is nothing Zombie Apocalypse about this album!! why did i buy this? because my GF sent me a link and i thought she had pre listen to it and gave it the green light.. my bad, this music sux! its more like music of an old vampire movie.. maybe i can find a use for it at the next Halloween party. track number 6. ""5 Meditations sur l'apocalypse: Cinq Meditations sur l'Apocalypse: II. Il etait, Il est et Il vient"" sounds like a mentally challenged patient got in to the Organ both at a baseball game and tried to play ""take me out to the ball game!

Awful In a moment of weakness after reading the reviews I purchased it.  Was very disappointed. I guess if you are into Halloween music it would be ok - maybe.,0
Five Stars Iconic song. Timeless track. A Smith's must have!,1
"Morrissey's Perfect Retooling of Norwegian Wood Morrisey's unique perspective on naive love and the worthless self.
Sometimes being the backseat passenger to that someone who we
perceive has the unquantifiable thing that we want, is the best we
can do....or say ""crawling off to sleep in the bath"".
The perfection we see in other's beauty is sometimes of our own
imagination; the ""home"" we imagine others have, is not theirs either.
Our failure to attain what we desire is sewn into the relationship,
unrequited love...in the darkened underpass...I looked around and noticed
there wasn't a chair.
Still, there is a light, and isn't it good, Norwegian Wood.",1
Great song One of my favorites. Great song,1

"Lila brava We discovered Lila Downs' music when we were in Baja, can't remember how, but once we caught that voice we were drawn to it and never moved far from it. We bought her CDs and played them in the RV as we drove to the furthest reaches away from Gringolandia those beautiful three months, camping at Playa San Pedrito south of Todos Santos, and many other magical loving places. She serenaded us everywhere, & all up that east coast of Baja above La Paz, among the Mejicanos and cuervos y mar y aire tan dulce. And we don't even speak Spanish, we just sorta picked it up from her soul of song putting us in the mood to understand more deeply the ancient Mexican spirit. Her singing goes right in your chest up to the wrist and squeezes hard, and it feels like you're being drawn out into a realer life. Growing up in Santa Fe as kids we 'd sneak out & spend a lot of time at night sitting along the Santa Fe river listening to the mariachi music from the cantinas nearby, and the best of the singers were the old gals with the gutsy sad and brave voices lamenting lost beauty and passion...Lila learned from some of them, maybe not from Santa Fe, but Mexican sisters, and listening to her took me right back to the summer evenings sitting with my brothers by the river listening through the open doors of the bars... Florinda Anaya looked after us kids sometimes back then in the 40's and she'd sometime take us to the Boys Club onLower  Agua Fria and belt out songs like Lila sings... and she too could turn into a cantadora vieja and sing those songs of lost lust and love, even though she was only 18. Makes me sob a little just thinking about it. Thanks Lila!!!!!

"Excellent Music but be careful where you buy! A few months ago I purchased this CD from an Amazon third party seller. The sound was not up the previous recordings I own by Lilia Downs, and the artwork and printing was blurred.  When I looked closely, the copyright said this CD had been made in Argentina. I was in Lima, Peru last year visiting relatives and was shocked to see that virtually every CD store was filled with recordings that had grainy reproductions of cover art, illegibly blurred printing; and burned on CD-R media. Either they are bootlegs, or the manufacturing standards for CDs are far lower than in the US and Europe. I think it would be very helpful if people would comment on the quality of the packaging and the sound quality of any CDs they purchase, particularly from Amazon third party sellers. This will not only help others know what sellers provide the quality we expect, but might even help artists get the royalties they are due.",0

Absolute crap This is not the band Filter from America.  This is something from China and absolutely horrible.  Obviously they're using the same name to cause brand/band confusion and profit from it.,0

"Decent This track is smooth and captures the imagination. However, its not one of those songs that can survive on a playlist that long.",0
Five Stars Just wonderful! :),1
"Beautiful! Another great clean solid EP from Iwan! If you liked his last EP, you'd surely love this one. Though, this recording isn't just him and his guitar and has a bit more production work thrown into it (a tiny bit). Really crisp and refreshing to listen to. This will surely be on repeat!",1
"Buy this and you will never need to wait again This song is an instant classic. Smooth R&B beats, nice flow with the lyrics, and the song tackles and solves problems from modern relationships. What else can do that for less than a dollar?",1
"Good one! Plus great to look at picture! This is a really good song, fast beat, nice picture too. Looking forward to hearing more from Jaymes Vaughanhen, of Chippendales! Gotta love them all :)",1

"Not too sure. At 99 cents I can not complain too loudly, although with my dial up service it took hours and hours to download to my mp4.
However, this item is not really subliminal, you can hear the voice of the presenter throughout.
I have no idea of how effective this will be for me, as I have just started listening to it, but I do know that true subliminals are inaudible and with this product, you can clearly hear his voice, so it is more of a hypnosis download really than a subliminal.

Time will tell .............",0
"Disappointing. I loved 28 Orange Street and The Big Fear. Then Isalie came out, and it was so lifeless and dull it seemed written by a different band. I had hoped the boys' interest in pulse-free, hook-free folk tunes was a temporary glitch, but alas, it seems like the new norm. The guys who wrote the folksy bounce of Burgundy and the faux-rocker Indie Rockin' are nowhere to be seen on this collection. Instead, it's more sedate and opaque songwriting, performed with no energy or drive. There's barely anything here that would count as mid-tempo, to say nothing of upbeat.

Like Isalie, I listened to this three or four times, and I couldn't tell you anything about any of the songs, and that makes me sad. Hopefully the upcoming collaboration with Dan Bern will be a return to form; until then, you're better off spinning the Big Fear again and dreaming.",0

"it has bass! WTF?? when i read ""without bass"", i figured, well, NO BASS! my bad i guess, for believing it...and its distorted. how do i get my .89 back?",0
"highly recommended. I agree with the other reviewer of this product. Many classical albums labeled as 'relaxing' or 'quiet' make you wonder how on earth they ever got titled such given the often loud, clangy music. Not so with this album; the piano is well done, calm, and relaxing; highly recommended.",1
"Magnifico! Sometimes, every once in a while one hears song so beautiful, it moves the soul to tears!",1
"Pretty much..  ..bad Major disapointment here. My prior and first experience with Incriminated was listening to ""Miracle Of Purity"". That was a hit. Really good Hellhammer-influenced blackened thrash with some slow-to-mid tempo variations.
""Possessed In Billnas"" caught my eye since it is hand numbered and limited to 333 copies (is it really ? That is pretty kult). I also enjoy live CDs as they capture the true, stripped sound of a band. Plus you're usually getting somewhat of a ""best of"". Here, we have  a set that sounds like it was recorded on someone's phone. Most of the music either sounds like:
A) some cruddy, casual YouTube audio
2) someone playing Guitar Hero
Has anyone ever listened to ""Agony In Paradise"" - Possessed's live CD ? That was a DAT soundboard recording which sounds way better than this.
The liner notes from this 2005 recording on the insert state ""Drunkenness, lewdness, blasphemy, and profanity. This album is an uncensored document of all the hell. It's not technically perfect but the energy is there.""
I can completely respect every word of that. And this is coming from someone who enjoys raw, abrasive, unpolished production. But here, it's just too low-fi and unlistenable. Eventually I will move on to another studio release from Incriminated. In the meantime, I will keep listening to ""Miracle Of Purity"".

"Not Again I don't understand why the format had to change.  I've purchased music from Amazon before and had no problems.  Since they started with the 'cloud' application, I have problems downloading music to my computer in MP3 format, or at all for that matter.  After several attempts, I had to contact Amazon and get a refund for music purchased but never received.  Unfortunate though, because it was really convenient - at first.",0
"This is not the same remix as the Youtube video I wanted the same version of the music video on Youtube ([...]), but this is not, despite the description ""as made famous by Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue"". Also this version shows an disproportionate and ridiculous use of Autotune.",0
"This song ROCKS! Great energy, great tune. Hope The Heathens post more songs for sale too. Would love a live version as well of this one.",1
MY FAVORITE SONG By far this is my favorite song. I listen to it for hours on repeat. It is very soothing.,1
"Great Reproduction Just what I wanted. Wonderful music with all the high, mid and lower ranges. Flows as it should. Highly recommend.",1
"Submerged in tranquility Submerged is soothing and very relaxing. The soft rise and fall of the strings at the end of the song made me feel like I was completely immersed in a large ""peace bubble."" I highly recommend Submerged for anyone who needs to unwind and relax. It's simply beautiful.",1
"Short Selection This selection of ""May Each Day"" is the closing  of his show and is only two lines of the song.  Were it the whole  song it would be  a 5-star.",0
Still Better In Old Days. It is not nearly as well performed or as good as I remembered.  I guess Whitesnake is still Whitesnake.,0

Love this Band! I love everything I've heard from this band.  Their  obvious passion for the music comes through in every song.  Excellent!,1
"Not Joan Jett, is a terrible 'remake' Bait & Switch - this is not 'I hate myself for loving you' by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.  It's a horrendous 'remake'.

This is the third time I've purchased a well-known song from Amazon music only to discover it isn't the actual song but an awfully done 'remake'/mix.

Amazon music had been my go-to for buying music, but they have had fewer & fewer popular songs/hits, & now they're substituting terrible remakes made by older, has-been artists/bands while advertising the songs as being by the original artists?  Not cool.",0

"Half Roma by way of Beirut Allah is my favorite musical performance. From the manic piano to the deep guitar, it is jaw dropping. We grew up calling it Greek, but now think its at least half Roma by way of Beirut, a pillar in my musical experience and cannot recommend it highly enough. Buy it, you will not be sorry.",1
"Their Finest Worksong I thought Country Feedback was a good song to begin with, but this version sends it flying into the atmosphere. The introduction lasts over 2 minutes while Neil Young rocks out on acoustic guitar. The final coda of Stipe singing ""It's crazy what you could have had/I need this!"" has him hitting his highest note that I can ever remember, and holding that final ""need"" for almost 14 seconds. Just amazing, and the song still had 2 and a half minutes left. At $1, you should have already bought this song.",1
Powerful Voice Ayaka has a great voice. She and her music really stands out from other Japanese pop stars out there. Anybody who is a fan of Japanese pop should give this one a listen.,1
"did they do this one in their sleep? this is a very tired version. liked everything else from the bridgeschool, but not this one. I deleted it after listening to less than half of it.",0
"Not your usual game soundtrack Very interesting soundtrack for BF3. Doesn't follow the conventional ""epic"" orchestral soundtracks of most games/movies. It sounds dark and industrial. A nice change from the normal stuff. I like the distorted sound of the instruments...adds a grittiness to it all. One of my fav soundtracks of all times? No but I'll give it a listen to now and again.",1
"Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations because the WRONG ... Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations because the WRONG record was in the album sleeve. It was the Gaylords singing Italian songs in Italian, not American songs in Italian. I still am keeping my eyes our for the correct album. It is hilarious!",0

"good delivery from Weiland Scott Weiland seems to enjoy performing these christmas songs and this is probably the stand out on the album.  I think he gives a great delivery and the band treats the song just right.  Classy and fun.  Weiland is better than most at this game.  I can't stand most Christmas singers these days, but I like his style.",1

"Amazing Album! This album is sure to please any fans of the Postal Service, as well as fans of frontman Aaron Perrino from his Sheila Divine years to his present status as Dear Leader singer/songwriter.

Though not their latest album,  The Good Times Are Killing Me  is an amazing blend of politically and socially infused songs with rich vocals, acoustics and digital beats.

Dear Leader is perhaps one of the hottest new bands in the Boston area, and their newest album,  All I Ever Wanted Was Tonight  is another must have. Do yourself a favor and grab their albums now. (...)

You won't regret it.",1

If you are interested in Porcupine Tree, Floyd , Airbag, etc, you will enjoy this album.  Hope to see more from this band in the future.",1

"3.5 stars... promising debut but much better live Shadowraptr is an indie band from Cincinnati. I had never heard of these guys until recently (more on that later), and I wondered if they were a rap band (given their band name). I couldn't have been more wrong. The band's sound is an intriguing mix of prog rock and funk if you can believe that.

""It's Always Winter On the Moon"" (9 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the 1 min. instrumental of ""Psychosis in Am Pt. III"", only then to delve into the 6 min. ""Cadavers"", which lays the groundwork for this album, an outstanding, expanding track, led by lead singer/drummer Aaron Collins. The guitar work from Stephen Patota is nice too. Other good tracks include ""Hey Kids! Let's Rap(tr)"", a great funky tune (and again, no rapping). The album concludes with the ambitious 7+ min. ""Psychosis in Am Pt. I and II"".

In all, this is a promising debut album. I saw these guys recently in concert here in Cincinnati, where they played many of the songs of this album, and live it sounded much heavier and funkier than what you hear on here. Can't wait to see them again.",1

"Disturbed about the quality of sound I have always enjoyed this interpretation and have owned it in many guises,from its domestic and then German LP pressings and most recently as an EMI Great Recordings of the Century CD re-mastered in 2001.  In each case there remained a kind of ""wooliness"" to the sound picture which prevented me from appreciating the beauty of the solo voices  and chorus - which seemed hard and too deeply buried in the fabric of the sound picture - with the result that the New Philharmonia Chorus and Orchestra never seemed fully focused ..at least through my stereo and home entertainment systems.

Thus it was with some uneasiness  that I plunked down almost $50 for this Japanese SACD pressing, which has been around for awhile. I would have done so sooner but I kept hoping EMI would release it as one of its very inexpensive DSD SACD sets of Klemperer material (Mozart symphonies, etc.) which became available domestically in 2012.  In any event  now that I've previewed this SACD pressing my impression is that it may be slightly but not dramatically better than the 2001 CD.  The general sound picture is very similar to that of the earlier CD.  There may or may not be a greater sense of solidity to the image.  My guess is that recent re-mastering processes were not used to upgrade the master tape transfer from its 2001 incarnation so that it was still this 2001 tape that was transferred via SACD to the CD disc.  Solo voices remained slightly ""hard"" and were still somewhat lost in the orchestral sound picture.
Given this, the question then becomes one of  whether this slight possible improvement is worth the extra $$$$.  At best I'd call it a close call.

ADDENDUM:  I've just determined that this Japanese pressing is probably not a SACD at all, which would explain its very small sonic differences with my earlier ""Great Recordings of the Century"" CD that I'd used for comparisons.  MY CD/SACD/DVD/BluRay player has a screen feature in which each disc being played is identified by type (either ""CDDA"" for conventional CDs or ""SACD PCM"". When I checked this Japanese pressing it read  ""CDDA Stereo 44.1K 16B"" which is the same reading I get for my conventional American ""Great Recordings of  the Century"" CD.  Furthermore, nowhere is the Japanese disc identified as ""SACD"" = with SONY's SACD and DSD trademarks in English....Only that it is in ""stereo"".  I've contacted the distributor to call this to their attention and identified two possibilities 1) that they'd mistakenly sent me the wrong pressing, or 2) that they've mis-advertised the type of CD on Amazon...which would lead to more serious consequences.  I've not yet heard from them, and if I don't within the next few days I will contact Amazon to press this complaint for their action.",0

"The Best Robert Parker Anthology On The Market Singer/saxophonist and band leader Robert Parker, born in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 14, 1930, is probably better known for his prolific session work than his own recordings having worked with giants like Fats Domino, Huey ""Piano"" Smith, Irma Thomas and, of course, Professor Longhair (real name Roy Byrd), including his 1949 regional hit Mardi Gras In New Orleans. In 1960 he cut his first solo single, the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino's Ron Records (Ron 327), which also did very well on a regional basis.

But his own hits were sparse, with the best being his vocal Barefootin' which surged to # 2 R&B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May/June 1966 for Nola Records, owned by Wardell Quezergue (March 12, 1930 - September 6, 2011) who, known as ""the Creole Beethoven"" in his native Louisiana, also produced his sides for that label. Released as Nola 721, the flip was Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is), a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day. After the follow-up Happy Feet/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726, he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R&B/# 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b/w Soul Kind Of Loving. In the meantime, he had had his one vinyl LP released titled, naturally, ""Barefootin'"" (Nola LP-1001) containing:  A1. Barefootin'; A2. Let's Go, Baby (Where The Action Is); A3. Mr. Pitful; A4. I've Been Loving You Too Long; A5. Soul Kind Of Living; A6. C. C. Rider; B1. The Scratch; B2. Happy Feet; B3. In The Midnight Hour; B4. Directly From My Heart; B5. Heading For A Fall; B6. I Can't Help Myself.

After that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts: Secret Service (Makes Me Nervous)/Yak Yak Yak (Nola 733) and Holdin' Out/Caught You In A Lie (Nola 738), both in 1967, followed by You Shaken' Things Up/You See Me (Silver Fox 12) in 1969, Get Ta Steppin'/Get Right On Down (Island 015) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life/same song (Island 044) in 1975. In that span, of course, he continued with his busy session work. There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware. You should note that Barefootin' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b/w Shootin' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3, but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version.

The tracks in this volume are: 1. Barefootin' (2:33); 2. Let's Go Baby (Where The Action Is) (2:28); 3. Mr. Pitiful (2:35); 4. I've Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now) (2:53); 5. Soul Kind Of Loving (2:49); 6. C.C. Rider (2:59); 7. The Scratch (2:35); 8. Happy Feet (2:13); 9. In The Midnight Hour (2:30); 10. Directly From My Heart (3:46); 11. Heading For A Fall (2:28); 12. I Can't Help Myself (2:27); 13. Tip Toe (2:28); 14. Secret Service (2:45); 15. Yak Yak Yak (2:42); 16. Everybody's Hip Huggin' (2:46); 17. Foxy Mama (2:46); 18. Holdin' Out (2:32); 19. I Caught You In A Lie (2:40); 20. Barefootin' Boogaloo (2:40); 21. Soul Sister (2:51); 22. Bow Legs (2:40); 23. Boss Lovin' (2:43); 24. Funky Soul Train (2:44).

From that you can see that all four sides to his only two nationally-charted singles are here, with excellent sound reproduction.",1
Great I love this album. Mr Parker lives just down the road from me and I was thrilled to find this album. I had him autograph it.,1
"DIsappointing to say the least Robert Parker's classic recordings for the Nola label deserve much better than this.  Everything here is mastered from vinyl, and in many cases, it's very bad vinyl.  Hiss, major scratches and distortion abound in most of these transfers.  This is a truly dreadful CD.",0

"A timeless UK Garage release from R.I.P. Productions R.I.P. Productions (and their alias of Double 99) is the British duo of Tim Liken & Omar Adimora.  R.I.P. were hands down some of the biggest pioneers in the 90's UK Garage scene and by far one of my favorite acts.  With nearly every single they released becoming an underground hit, R.I.P. produced a unique and identifiable feel to every track.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1;

1. Move to Jersey  10/10 (Vocal sample with bumpy piano riffs)
2. The Rub (Remix)  9/10 (DnD's ""Diamond Rings"" riff mixed with some female doo-wop vocals)
3. Reach  10/10 (Bumpy Vocal dub UK Garage that's simply amazing!)

Originally released on Ice Cream Records vinyl in 1996, R.I.P. Grooves Vol. 1 is another one of R.I.P. Productions most perfect releases.  With all three tracks representing the best of the 90's underground UK Garage scene.  With the rerelease of these tracks in digital format from the original vinyl (which are now quite expensive) has made me as a long time UK Garage fan very happy.",1

Many are hard put to give it, its due. A much deeper Satie experience.",1
"Satie Diminished The pianist on ""Gymnopdies"" does not have the understanding of Satie's timing; it's a horrible rendering of the Gymnopdies, in my opinion. I purchased the album ""Erik Satie"" played by Reinbert de Leeuw who certainly does understand the importance of Satie's timing. Brilliant!",0
"The first in a series of four...yet the worst of four It wasn't even the best of the Capitol Records compilations (Merry Christmas Baby - Romance and Reindeer...I believe the second disc in that series...takes that spot)...  There were only three or four tracks on this that I actually liked...and three were on other compilations...  The Les Paul jingle Bells might have been worth the price of the CD alone...but the rest drug it down...  Other honorable mentions would be Tex Ritter's Merry Christmas Polka...and Ray Anthony & The Bookends Christmas Kisses...

Three I found on Dr. Demento compilations (and with better quality) Stan Freberg's Night Before Christmas...Yogi Yorgesson's I Yust Go Nuts At Christmas and the immortal Mel Blanc Yah das ist ein Christmas Tree...

If you must have all four discs...this would be the hardest to find...and judging by most of that is on it...I can tell why...  The absolute low point was Bing Crosby croaking out the tired old dud called Do You Hear What I Hear?...  This one alone made me break out the Tiny Tim Christmas Album AND Hung For the Holidays to get that asinine banter out of my head...  Anything that causes you to do this is really not worth buying...",0

"An album you just gotta hear! The Illusion - If It's So (original vinyl LP)

  All 3 of the Illusion albums are stunning albums......heavy in some parts....fuzzed out psychy in other parts yet still full of soul and rock 'n roll.  ""If it's So"" was the debut album and by the end of 1969 they would have released their second album.

  The Illusion were  Michael Ricciardella (drums), Richie Cerniglia (guitar), Chuck Alder (bass), Mike Maniscalco(guitar, keyboards), and John Vinci (vocals). The Steed label released three albums over two years and then they sadly broke up and now psychedelic rock collectors are scooping up their albums.

"An unimaginative and disappointing effort Apparently ""lullaby"" means xylophone and sleigh bells to Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star. I love Iron Maiden and was hoping to be able to pass on my love of their music in a way that's gentle to young ears. I wanted to like this album, but couldn't.

The concept is fantastic, but the execution is very poor with the stereotypical and unimaginative arrangement of xylophone/marimba percussion and childish music box sounds. Many of the songs are unrecognizable. Most annoying are the sleighbells. They feature prominently in EVERY single one of the songs. Really? Is this Christmas versions of Iron Maiden or did I read the title wrong? How about some soft guitar or violins, or anything else for that matter?

It's a real insult to the musical genius of the band, one of the most creative and influential bands of our time. They could've done so much with the source material, but instead chose to make a bland, uninspired, and gutless low-fidelity experience. The lack of care to the source material extends down to the cover, which looks like a bad Halloween party poster. They couldn't done a clever child-friendly take on one of Iron Maiden's album art. You can listen for yourself to the samples provided by Amazon and make your own decision. If you have Amazon Prime, you can listen to the full album on your mobile app for free.

"YES YES YES and MORE YES!!! I discovered the Kidney Thieves and Free Dominguez from their work on the sound track for the video game Deus Ex Invisible War. KT was featured in a very limited part of the game, however, just that tidbit was enough to change my perspective on music for ever. Up until that point in my life I'd only listened to classic rock, classic country and a hair bit of anything else. KT opened my eyes to a whole new world of music that I hadn't even known exisited...to date I haven't heard a single track that I can honestly say, ""eh its okay"". Every single song is its own. Thank you KT for making music that kicks A$$ on every level from the words, the depth, melody, everything. I highly recommned that you give these tracks and all other KT work(to include Free Dominguez's solo work) a good thorough listen.",1
"Cerebral, Powerful, Brilliant! I've been a fan of kidneythieves for years and have closely followed all of their releases. Many bands as they continue to churn out albums start to lose the creative touch, their edge diminished. Not so with these guys. This follow up EP to last year's Tryptofanatic is equally brilliant. It's far more melodic and ambient than the heavy guitars and industrial metal riffs that they are known for, but that doesn't mean it doesn't rock. And as always, the highlights are the vocal styling of lead singer Free Dominguez and the philosophical core to the lyrics. It's a journey that will make you bob your head as well as provoke deep thought. Music is in a sad state currently with over-produced, over-hyped cookie cutter bands striving for radio-friendliness. kidneythieves notoriously buck that trend and make the music they want to make. That reason alone is enough to elicit your support.",1

It's composed of songs that are elemental and joyous, evoking strong images with exceptional musicality, where musical vistas actually come into view, vary and evolve in an orderly progression rather than the endless meandering as is too often the case elsewhere in this genre.
Good new age music is simply jazz in another guise - possibly slightly more focused on the melodic rather than the harmonic content.
LaRoche has a real touch and style that captivates the listener and always impacts the emotions. It doesn't try to overwhelm, but reaches for a fine emotional balance to carry listeners on a personal journey through rich landscapes of pure emotion.
This is truly gorgeous solo piano record of extraordinary recording quality.
You can hear chords echo off of canyon walls and hear the quite of a summer's field. The grandeur of the wide open big sky plains above are ended only by the curvature of the earth below, with lyrical, trickling sounds of coursing streams conjured across such beautiful sounds of grandeur and serenity.

It all shows in LaRoche's careful crafting and ability to vary his style and choice of tonalities. The dynamics are very subtle, even missed a few times until you notice them. Soothing, melodic and dextrous playing that set's this album apart as something very special indeed.",1
I wanted the essential donnie mcclurkin I wanted the speak to my heart which is on the essential album this was the wrong song and they don't let you see enough of the name or hear enough of the sample to determine. I was using my phone to try to order it.,0
"So long David This album like all the rest of them from the Emerson group is a masterstroke.

Having seen the quartet play in concert and having listened to all of their recordings, it's  sad for me to see David Finkel leaving the group. The album cover shows him halfway out the door.  I've seen David Finkel play in other ensembles at local chamber festivals and he always takes the lead in focussing the energies of the other players. What the Emerson ""trio"" will do with him gone time will tell us. I feel for the cellist who wants to enter that special micro world of the Emerson Quartet. But who knows. No one is irreplaceable  David and his wife Wu Han as heads of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will continue their world wide search for talent. They are remarkable international advocates for their art.",1
"Ninella This version is tamed at the point of being insignificant. If you can find it, get the version by the Taricata, named ""Ninella"". We plaeyd it hundreds of times....)(",0
"Outstanding Vocals, riffs, beats.  All outstanding.  I don't like equating them with Sabbath as the vocals are nothing like them.  Iommi was awesome too in his day, but this is better.  What Iommi would have wanted.  Listened to it yesterday with earbuds in while doing physical work...  I worked my ass-off and didn't even notice what I'd accomplished until it was over.  Had to listen to it again in the car on the ride home.  Outstanding.",1
"Praise for Samsara Blues Experiment (and Waiting for their Next Release!) I've not been excited about new music for quite some time, but this band shifts that paradigm. Fantastic composition mated with meaningful lyrics (not to mention the masterful execution of it all) makes the band's second full-length album a solid, hard-hitting testament to the true musician's art. I'd be tempted to say that Long Distance Trip is the better of the two main albums currently on the market, but that statement is really unfair. Remember that music must be dynamic, as must the band that creates it. Definitely worth the buy and your patronage! If you're unsure of this, just check out their page on Bandcamp:

Four Stars GREAT,1
"Barry's back-up orchestra really hits the right chords here The year was 1979 and movie themes were making a comeback due to the success of box office smashes like ""Star War,"" ""Saturday Night Fever,"" and ""Superman.""  What better form to showcase Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra than to have the ensemble try its hand at these and other well-known melodies.  However, White pays homage to classic themes as well, including ""Theme from A Summer Place,"" ""The Way We Were,"" and the best track on the album, ""As Time Goes By"" from ""Casablanca.""

White even does his own take on contemporary Isaac Hayes' Oscar-winning ""Theme from Shaft.""

Liked it When I first Heard It This is not a deep review. The fact is i saw a movie the other day and this song was playing in what I think was the most fun scene of the film. It just kind of stuck in my head so I bought it. I'm surprised I never came across it all these years. Upbeat and fun song. Didn't pay close attention to the lyrics one way or another like I usually do. It was definitely an exception to my rule.,1
"too many duplicates There are far too many duplicate tracks, especially if also bought the 99 Most Essential Autumn, Winter, & Spring series.",0
"A solid set, but watch the repeats X5 has done it again. They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their ""99"" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the MP3 Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.

This is almost all excellent music in good to very good performances. If you haven't bought a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.

Some number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you've purchased from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on previous ""99"" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.

Among the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music ""greatest hits"" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert's Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.

Within the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to buy. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden's Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what's going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/her-own-excellent-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas/dp/B005DWX9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">her own excellent album of the Ives sonatas</a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg/Johnson performance, but I can't say it's my favorite.

Another highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi. These are great pieces, although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Leonard-Bernstein-in-the-last-concert-before-his-death/dp/B000001GEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Leonard Bernstein in the last concert before his death</a>&nbsp;remain my favorite.

Finally, there are a range of modern tracks by Scandinavian, German and Japanese composers that I found of interest -- pieces by Masakazu Natsuda, Klaus Jckle, Carin Malmlf-Forssling, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Dag Wirn, Kalevi Aho, Markus Zahnhausen, Erna Tauro, Einojuhani Rautavaara, and Yoshinao Nakada are all well off the beaten path and I was more than happy to pay a couple of bucks to hear this new-to-me music. I can't promise that you'll love all of it -- I didn't either -- but hearing new things is welcome.

Total download size is 938 MB. Bitrates are variable and average 159-240 kbps.

Recommended for anyone at the Daily Deal price. There is a lot of great music here.

"dyslexic alert Note:  Title of horrible album---or so the reviews would imply---is ""awolnatOIN!""  The really good GROUP is ""awolNATION.""  Megalithic symphony.  Buy that one.",0
"Horrible I must have been drunk when I ordered this, it's some of the worst music I've ever heard. This album is proof positive that anyone without talent can sell music.  All they have to do is work in a organ store, borrow a few hooks from semi popular songs and then mix the two.  White noise on the TV is more enjoyable to listen to.  DO NOT BUY THIS.",0
not what you might think This is a bunch of muzak-like covers. And NOT the band AWOLNATION like I originally thought. The band is Symphony Cafe. The name of the album is only (maybe) coincidentally the same name as the Aaron Bruno's AWOLNATION. Don't buy thinking any of this will be on the same level as SAIL.,0
very authentic Jewish traditional from what is now northern Romania ... very authentic Jewish traditional from what is now northern Romania and southern ukrain once besarabia region ruled by Austria empire.,1

YECK Someone put a cut from this track on a YouTube vid. I liked it. Had no idea that the track they played was a loop from one part of this horrendous song.,0

"Doyle!!!!!! Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver sing 1 of their best songs ever!!! ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!
the most played and enjoyed album of my Christmas season. THANKS!",1

"Two Stars it's a re-do, not the original.....",0
"not the original I wanted I found out that you or somebody, is pretty slick, the guy had 1 hit ""feelings"", the rest are some old guy singing a song that if put out at the time would have bombed. Then I find out you can't get the song Unless you pay $10 for the album. What a RIP OFF!!!  There are way too many songs to fall for that con game you and other music download places or the record industry are playing.",0
Old favorite... Loved the song when I first heard it and still enjoy listening to it today.  Great song that never gets old.,1
"Not making me wanna dance Terrible use of the sample! he ruined that song for me, Nicki minaj is actually pretty good with the beat but not sean skip this!!",0
DISAPPOINTED.... When I first heard that Nicki Minaj would be on the remix I thought she would be a good addition to the track. Wrong. Her verse just isn't good and sounds like she didn't take any time to at least think about what she was going to say. I have really enjoyed her music and her guest spots on other artists songs so I did have high hopes. Oh well. Stick with the original album version.,0
"One of the best Mint Condition This is a great album!! I left the cd in the disc player in a car that I sold, I wanted to kick myself. I had to have it again.",1
"Still Mint Condition R&B! When you have been around as long as this group, staying fresh without losing your unique identity and sound is a real challenge.  However, this album is undeniable proof that it can be done!  I not only enjoyed compositions and performances on almost every track, but also was delighted to find the signature ""Mint Condition"" sound meshed with unprecedented nuances on every track as well!  Over 26 years of work and still producing mint condition R&B...impressive indeed!",1
"I expected better I purchased this cd because I had faith in this long time favorite group of mines. I really don't have the funds to waste, but I wanted to support this group. Bottomline, very disappointed. Ther are only 2 songs that I like on the whole cd.  I will stick with purchasing individual tracks, lesson learned.",0
"Awesome! Its my new ringtone The hook in the chorus is known for sticking in your brain. Fortunately, that's not a bad thing. I believe it's a remake of a 50's Sinatra classic. The group imulates that era very well, is so smooth and blend so well, you can't help from getting into a festive mood. The chorus is now my wife's ringtone. She loves it.",1
"...ehhhh I kept hearing the beat w/the MC Hammer sample under it as folks were riding by, it became addictful... however the lyrics (if you can call them that are made of the WACK crap that is passing for rap these days, i should've known better)",0
"English Version This is the full English version of the song. I really enjoy it. I'm not a huge GG fan, but this is awesome.",1
Disappointed I give this group its rating because the music didn't do it for me. It seemed as if it was a cloned from the a group from the 70's.,0
"Suckered I thought I might like this on the download, however, it was very disappointing, I do not care too much for this song.",0
"Stunning... I saw Josh and his band perform live in Michigan this past summer, with Shelagh Brown opening for him.  Josh is great and his band definitely rocks - but this song, super-charged by Shelagh's powerful harmonies and solo verse, really is the highlight of the new CD.  I still can't believe they didn't do this duet live at the Michigan show, but I am hopeful that it will turn up on the next leg of his tour, with Shelagh Brown as his special guest.  What a stunning track!  I can't wait to hear what else Shelagh has in store for us!",1
Go This is my favorite Kari Kimmel album. Solid through out,1
"Horrid Horrible noise i'm shocked people make money off this garbage.
I hope that this cRap is taken off this website.",0
Meek Mill Great song. In my opinion for his first album Meek Mill killed this song. Can't wait for his second album to come out.,1
Review It didn't download right and ended up wasting money. I don't know if this happens to everybody or not. Better luck next time i guess.,0
Five Stars One of her best vocal work.,1
Two Stars meh,0
"This is not metal! I thankfully avoided purchasing this album, having nearly done so without bothering to sample the songs, which to me would be almost unthinkable but that speaks to my absolute enthusiasm for the (dead) possibility of a beautifully-packaged and unknown side project by the prog metal band, Periphery.

If Periphery's metal could be said to have a polar opposite, this could arguably be it.  This album might even be a joke.  I'm not even sure if this is passable fare for fans of low-fi polka, if that's what this is, if such fans even exist.",0
This is not the ProgMetal band Periphery!!! Casio driven keyboard crap from Eastern Europe somewhere.  It's terrible.  I ordered it because I thought it was the progressive metal band of the same name but neglected to sample any tracks first.,0
Five Stars Another great collaboration,1
Four Stars Good song!,1
"A beautiful Opera, an old and uninspired recording Guercoeur is a beautiful Opera seldom played. This is the only recording available on CD for now. The sound quality is far from good and the interpretation is uninspired. However, until Michel Plasson's recording becomes available this is the only way to discover this masterpiece.",0
A wonderful classic band One of my fave albums.  A wonderful classic band. Great tunes. Excellent performances and a lovely in your living room feel. I miss these guys.,1
"doesn't sound like the original version Maybe it is, but this doesn't sound like the original version I remember from years ago, which I was hoping to get.",0

"Review of ""Strange Cargo"" A fantastic debut album that is brooding without being pessimistic or pretentious, the lyrics are haunting, and the sounds are fresh.  The entire album flows evenly and each track is consistent without sounding the same.  Definitely a keeper for any fan of EBM who digs Haujobb, Seabound, De/Vision and others.",1

"Great, refreshing new rock music Punk meets rock meets vaudeville.  Seriously, this is some of the most original rock music I've heard in the last decade.  The album works from the first track to the last and you'll find yourself singing along with it days later.  Definitely worth a listen.",1

Totally Corny!!! I've studied and practiced qi gong and hypnotherapy for about ten years now and always look into continuing education. I decided to buy this mp3 download because of Dean Evanson name on the label since I like some of his music. But as soon as I started listening I was totally put off by the cave echo sound effect and oversimplistic and amateur female narration of guided meditation.  Those completely new to reiki or any sort of energy healing might actually find this recording helpful.,0

"Not your father's Cumbia I am a big fan of house mix of old standards. Not many in the USA are familiar with the Cumbia genre, so this may be lost on them. But the unmistakable Cumbia comes through in a festival sort of way, as though you are walking through the streets of Bogata during Carnival, passing by various music venues...

"This is my current favorite collection of '70s Nigerian band music This is my current favorite collection of '70s Nigerian band music. The sound quality is a little rough, maybe less clear than the three NIGERIA '70s albums, but the musicians are good and the total sound is attractive and a little strange, as if it's drifting in on some magic radio from another time and place. A pleasing stew with bits of heavy reverb, oddly tuned horn sections, nice solos and great grooves.

As a thumbnail description: It's a mix of bands. Overall closer to Sunny Ade than Fela. There are also hints of music from other parts of Africa, like Les Bantous de la Capital.

Don't let the slightly lo-fi sound put you off if you like the music in the samples. Go for the musicianship and atmosphere. ymmv.

p.s. ... There's some nice solo trumpet on one track (""Feso jaiye""), and i'm wondering if this is Lester Bowie from the Art Ensemble of Chicago, who said in an interview that he lived in Lagos for a while and met Fela.",1
"Find a better version I love toccata and fugue but when I purchased this particular one, the little preview clip they let you listen too was deceiving: not only is the song a lot shorter than I remember, it's also REALLY fast. That was my problem with it; if only you could slow it down do that one could actually hear the song and recognize its distinctive and often pretty parts. This version goes so fast that the song is utterly ruined and almost all enjoyment of it is destroyed. I gave it a 2 star rating becsuse it isn't complete garbage:; and I'll still listen to it, but I'll also hate looking at that ugly cover art that's for sure.",0

This song sounds exactly the way I remembered it, I just couldn't get enough of it. I could play it over and over again, just wish the songs were longer then I wouldn't have to keep replaying ha ha! The quality is great and they sound so good it makes me now, want to buy all his movies! If you love Elvis and you have memories then you will love his music & movies. Fantastic digitals & remakes.

Well after listening, it was hard to tell if I was listening to a CD or an old album that someone had used as a frisbee sometime. There are more snaps, clicks, pops,skips & scratches on this CD then my old record albums. This is just another rip-off import CD put together by someone looking to make a fast buck. There is no quality on this CD because basically it is two very used albums transferred directly to disc. Don't waste your money here. Hopefully someone in the future will put out these gems in some form of remastering. The music is still worth waiting for.",0
"Amazon downloading problem Why?  Because it downloaded 8 copies when I asked for one, and each of those were only 25 seconds long.  The first 25 seconds of the song.

"My Favorite Band The first time I heard Wild Child was right before they played a local music festival in August of 2014. One of the first songs I remember hearing was Pillow Talk and it stuck with me. It's been a year and a half and I have seen them live one other time. Their music is usually upbeat but the lyrics are about heartbreak, relationship issues or destructive behavior. The ukulele played by Alex makes you want to go skipping down the sidewalk but when you listen to the lyrics they can be haunting. Kelsey has a beautiful voice both recorded and in person. She has a lot of passion and you can hear it when she sings. When Alex sings with her their voices blend amazingly well. You would think they were a couple but really they just make beautiful music together.",1
Five Stars Love Wild Child,1
Great band!! Saw them in concert in LA and was very impressed. The next day I bought their album and have shared it with many people.,1
"Beautiful music I saw this band as an opener on New Years Eve 2012 and fell in love. The album was just a pleasing as the performance. The eclectic mix of instruments flows together beautiful and perfectly excentuates the two singers, one male and one female. The music is somewhat reminiscent of one of my favorite bluegrass band, Elephant Revival, so if you like a Wild Child they're worth checking out.",1

It sounds amazing! As far as the music, Chad told me that they pull a lot of influence from Rush and prog. bands of the like, but I also hear a space rock sound, like from some of the Cave In CDs.

Jude (Be Somebody) - great song, great message.  Check out the acoustic version on Youtube.
Freeky People - my favorite on the album.  It manages to be catchy and aggressive at the same time.
Velveteen - chill vibe mixed with bursts of rock. Unique sound.  I like it.
Dark Horse - nice lyrics.

It was the music though that stuck in my head. To the point that I just had to have it. It is so unique and smooth. I just fell head over heels. This album rules. I have had it on repeat since I bought it and I share the song B.U.S.T. with everyone. So far in my completely unorthodox and informal survey it has been a unanimous hit. Just wonderful chill and not so chill tunes. I am looking forward to more from Emezie.,1

"Very catchy song The title is not meant to be an attack on someone's sexuality or homosexuality in general. So go ahead and get that out of your mind right now. (Go ahead. Clear your mind. I'll wait.)

 There. now if you would just take the time to listen to the words, you will find one hell of a good song. It's a song about Billybob wishing to find himself a good woman (Or any woman for that matter) and to address the rumors swirling in the fan community about his sexuality. (Why anyone would want to put a sexual preference on a fictitious character is beyond me)

 I was quite surprised by this song. Aaron Fechter crafted a simple yet beautiful song. Well worth the 99 cents!

 So buy this song and giggle. And don't look too deeply into it.",1
"Rockafire rules! Who cares? Billy Bob just wants to clear the rumor. Makes sense to me. People need to quit trying to ban words, especially when its in a complicated context like this where you have to know backstory. This is a gift to all of the Rockafire fans, who never dreamed they would be able to buy NEW songs by Rockafire Explosion!",1

Great Really like all of seals music.  Haven't heard anything from him lately but he has a beautiful voice.  Great artist.,1
"Dissapointing! In theory this would be a wonderful purchase but in fact it is not in proper fusha Arabic but Arabic with Egyptian pronunciation.

Please Noorart, what were you thinking????",0
Five Stars excellent,1
"Don't want no MP3! I LOVE this music! I LOVE the songs! I don't want MP3. I want a physical CD that I can play in my car, on my stereo, or on my laptop! I'm going to keep hoping it will be released in a format that will make me happy :)",0

"Kosmische Jazz Dzyan played some uniquely powerful Kosmische prog! As hard-hitting as Guru Guru and as eclectic as Agitation Free, but with serious jazz chops approaching Mahavishnu-land. The music is alternately spacy/exotic and busy/crisp - the most effective blending of psychedelia and true jazz that one is likely to hear anywhere.",1

Best Christmas Song Ever!! I love this song sooo much. If you like Justin Bieber and Christmas songs then you'll love this song .,1
love it The original one is awesome but this one is amazing and so entertaining and has beats and just wants to make you dance,1

"Great !Great! If you enjoy true worship,with heart,soul and sincerity to usher the presence of God through soothing melodic gospel music. This is a perfect selection. I enjoy this one.",1
"Amazing album Amazing instrumental guitar album from one of the founding members of Warumpi Band. Moody and atmospheric, it's the perfect background music when I am doing some writing don't want the words of a song to distract me from the words on my screen.

Recommended for fans of the Warumpis, and those (like me) who enjoy the instrumental music released by various members of Midnight Oil during Peter Garrett's time away from music. (see The Break and Jim Moginie's Electric Guitar Orchestra).",1
Five Stars ok,1
Five Stars Great priceless oldie!,1
"Poppy garage - dig it! One song is actually about ""prarie puppies, one is black the other chubby"" and I don't know if he's singing about gophers or what but it's dorky and fun and actually really rocks in a lighter version of maybe a Jesus & Mary Chain sound. Very fast pop with a garagey twinge to it. If you're a serious garage person, you may find that too silly & lighthearted for you, but I love it. Although ""Miracle"" is even a little too sweet for me.",1
"Not A Party When it has came down to Beyonce's music lately, it has honestly became a bit more of a snore than something that even feels like a triumph. With the poor status of 4, she really wasn't able to thrive in the way of the diva that she made herself out to be. Her 6th single from 4, Party, feels a bit more lackluster in appeal, than strong from her voice as it could have made out to be. I really didn't like the song that much, and truthfully I think Beyonce' needs to find her voice again. I do wish her well becoming a new mother, but overall her music needs a bit of tuning up. Hopefully, there could be more of a ""swagu,"" as quoted in the song from her the next time around.

Song: D+",0
One of the best! In my opinion - one of the best and most-powerful Queen songs in existence!  Freddie Mercury really brings this track alive!!,1
"Party Great at the end of the party tune because its not fast, but just right.  I think J. Cole was Beyonce's right choice for the song.  Don't be surprised hearing it blasting from the bars nearby while tanning on a caribbean island sipping on a cold glass of coconut juice with a slice of lemon wedged on the side!",0
"Not Worth Partying When it has came down to Beyonce', she honestly has suffered with the ""senior slump"" of her album 4 not really delivering with expectations of what her past records had drawn. Sadly, the songs just don't really feel like they have even came close to hitting the nail on the head. Party, the 6th single from that album, teaming up with J. Cole, feels weak and not really filled with the substance that her fans had definitely hoped from her. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, and felt she had let her voice and drive go. I would honestly not recommend the ""Swagu"" that Beyonce' put on the song for your music library. Stick with something more addictive from her like Single Ladies instead.

"unless someone wishes to explain I mean NOWHERE, in NO biography of the Beatles, including Mark Lewisohn's exhaustivly researched new book on their early years, have I ever heard anything about Stuart Sutcliffe ever recording anything,ever, with or without the beatles.

"Probably fake Sounds fake to me....
Sounds like the same singer who played Stu in Birth Of The Beatles, and it is in the same key, even if it isn't the same take. And BOTH versions are in the same key and style and tempo as Percy Sledge's 1966 cover of the tune.
A very unlikely coincidence, IMO....
The chance of this song actually being Stuart Sutcliffe is pretty slim....
I would be very interested in learning more about the provenance of the tape,
where and when the instrumental overdubs were performed, and a bit more concerning the initial recording itself.
And why it is that no mention, no rumor of this recording has ever been documented in the nearly 50 years since it was supposedly made, with all the intense press scrutiny of all the people surrounding the Beatles, their Hamburg days, and their friends (Klaus, Jurgen, Astrid, etc).....
More information needs to be forthcoming on this track.",0

"Alfons Bauer Zither Music The three CD set sounded good in the description, but doesn't sound that good when played. The songs are seperated into tracks, but they don't have much lead in or fade out time. They almost run into each other as if not seperated by tracks. Some songs are even trunkated somewhat; some of the songs seem to be missing their begining. In short, whoever produced this set of CDs did not edit the songs very well. If I knew this before I bought the set, I would have passed on this purchase.

"Inspiring and Uplifiting Similar to Coldplay's magnificent, Death and All His Friends from Viva La Vida. Up With the Birds, has layers that make the song wholesome. It begins with a ballad, but soon progresses to clever instrumental bird sounds. Then the melody hits, and Martin's, ""My life to go, where they don't my name"" and ""go all over the world, just to see her again"" are majestic. The Mylo Xyloto album was a bit disappointing, but this track lives up to Coldplay's abysmal songs.",1
"Not up to par with this the cds This download sounds as if someone ripped it off a CD with a mic to a speaker ,its loud and echo y. The Longer track is just the intro and the sounds better then the first main track, still a little loud and booming.

"Another Funny Rockable Album Like ""Trapped In The Body of a White Girl"", the album really rocks and is really funny too. I love her references to Disco also. She's kind of like a female version of Weird Al Yankovic.",1
"Impregnating rock for people of all ages The music on ""Get Your Science Right"" is tempered with uncertainty and longing, suggestive of adventure, reflecting a sort of vague wisdom; it's wistful, earnest music that also feels deep, even though it really isn't. But above all it just feels happy and joyous, an explosion of warm feeling rendered in sound. It was an ideal move from a band that just a few years earlier had been a bunch of punk kids from a nowheresville called McKinney with more confidence than skill. Lush, rich, smooth, epic, emotional and utterly gorgeous are only a few of the ways to describe this work of art.  If HSATRTG were to make another album, I don't know if there will be any brain matter left in my skull to handle it.

I made my girlfriend listen to this album and she birthed 7 children by the end of ""Highway to Hawaii"".",1

Great Song Great Song,1
"Wonderful music I had the great pleasure to purchase one of the CDs and to even see the artist live in downtown Detroit. Awesome music, worth every penny!",1
"Shows Promise This first CD demonstrates or shows promise, which hopefully the band reached on their subsequent two CDs, which I have not heard.  I have to give this first CD a fairly low rating for multiple reasons.  I guess first and foremost the music is all over the place.  You could probably ask a dozen different people to name a dozen different artists that the CD sounds like, and each could easily do so.  For brevity (instead of naming all the sound-a-likes), Ill just say envision King Crimson with Kate Bush as the lead vocalist.  The CD is not very long at only around 38 minutes, and it basically is just one little snippet of noise after another for the most part - lot of intense angular type noise, with little melodic breaks.  There are no extended melodies.  It sounds as though basically the group went into the studio with the sole purpose of just trying to throw in every kind of abstract, mishmash, gadgetry, off-the-wall soundscape that they could think of (you know the kitchen sink concept).  But to close on a positive note, the reason I said the CD shows promise is because the lead vocalist does have a nice voice and the playing does sound like a nice overall tight ensemble, i.e., good musicianship.  The music basically just needs to be significantly more focused, and the kitchen sink concept needs to be abandoned big time.",0

"Only 13 reviews for Jon's best work since Magnification???? Only 13 reviews?!?!?!  How is this possible?  Did fans miss the memo?

This is clearly and unarguably Jon's best work since Yes' Magnification in 2001.  And I would go as far as to say his best solo work ever.  Jon has tapped into something very special with this piece of music.  His spirituality is forefront (as it always is) except now it is delivered by a man who is sure of who he is and the world around him, spiritually.  He has definitely evolved and 'arrived'.  The music is fantastic - developed, well-orchestrated, and filled with depth.

So why 4 stars?  Honestly?  Because as much as I love listening to ""Open"" (and I do, I listen to it often), I am often reminded of just how much MORE this song could have been had it been recorded with YES with a symphony orchestra like Magnification.  I miss full drums (not just percussion), Steve's guitar work, and obviously Chris' bass work.  Had ""Open"" been recorded wtih YES-proper, I don't think it would be an understatement to then rank it right along side of Close To The Edge, Gates Of Delerium, and Awaken because the playing that Steve, Chris and Alan would have brought to the table would have elevated this song into the stratosphere.

But regardless, this is still an inspiring and very fulfilling piece of music that will resonate and travel with me for the rest of my life.

Thank you Jon!!!!  Now do it again!!!!!!! LOL!",1
Excellent I really think this song reflects Jon Anderson. I just went to a YES concert and I was so disapointed not to se Jon Anderson in stead they hired a very young kid that sings very close to Jon's voice but never like him. Its a shame the group that I love for so many years is done. If you ask me I prefer Jon's music than what Yes is making now.,1

"Another Jack Johnson to add!!! While this song is not available on the normally released albums, it has great harmony and is one of my favorites by him.  I'm glad I chose to purchase this single!",1
"Good Jon, Not Classic Yes Jon Anderson is utterly unique in the world of popular music.  A little too distinctive for some, but we who like his work will like ""Open.""  This is no Yes album and the reasons are clear by contrast with ""Fly from Here,"" which is great--but very different in musical direction.  The orchestration on ""Open"" is almost overwhelming and the more sparse arrangements and production more memorable.  Please don't expect the crytalline vocals of 40 years ago--voice is a young man's game and no amount of doubling and other engineering can disguise that.  But Jon's no one-trick pony; he's become an outstanding and well-rounded musician, so the growing compositional abilities more than compensate for diminished vocals.  This is truly a Jon work.  Dig it.",0
"Terrific Band, Check it out!! This might be the best band you've never heard of. They've been at it for a long time, and the front man and writer Steve Decesare keeps putting out new material.

"Ghastly intonation problems Untuned ensembles, flubbed attacks, sour sustained pitch, uncentered passing tones and just plain wrong notes - this set has it all.

The 5th and 6th are okay, and I mean just okay, as in 3 out of 5 Amazon stars. But the opening bars of the seventh symphony are emblematic of the whole: horn <oops>, winds <flinch>, trumpet <urp>, clarinets <O merciful lord>....

The tightly packed box is 3/4 inches (2 cm) thick and contains paper envelopes with round plastic windows for each disc. The ""booklet"" is a folded leaf with track listings and running times, but nowhere is there any mention of the vocal soloists. A web search revealed a lot of names I didn't recognize plus Beverly Sills. Beverly Sills? Why is this label ignoring such a huge marketing asset?

Steer far clear of this edition. It is eleven hours that you will never get back. Life is too short to listen to badly tuned Mahler.",0

Do not buy!  Amazon, correct this!

This is the kind of album that has something significant in every song that stands out from the others. The Rhythms are warm and have very strong direction.  No song on this album should go unheard.  I strongly recommend this album if you like The Starting Line, with The Early November kind of Rhythms, or if your just looking for a great album don't let this one go.  Like they say 90% of good music goes unheard, don't let this one be one of the 9/10.  This album has won a place in my cd case.  Believe me thats an honor enough. Buy This Album!",1

Yeah, they're THAT good!!! Keep it up, Pentatonix. We all need more groups like you who remind us of what music is really all about: Beauty, being unique, translating emotions into wonderful sound, and having REAL TALENT!",1
"Pentatonix has this one Locked Down I haven't bought music since ??, but I fell in love with Pentatonix when they aced Love Lockdown on The Sing-Off.

Ridiculousness This comes across as a mocking joke. Like some sort of bad comedy sketch and the joke really isn't funny. The music is simple and sounds like something you could whip up with the simplest of musical programs. The album title In Metal would have been more aptly names In Crap. Giving this one start was too many for the abysmal atrocity this thing is.,0

"Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet's new album of works by Glass and Nyman There are two multi-movement works by Philip Glass and one by Michael Nyman on the new album released by the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet. Taken as complete wholes, none of the three is outstanding, though there are individual movements within them that are very powerful.

The ""Mishima"" quartet is actually an adaptation for saxophones of a work Glass originally wrote for strings, part of the soundtrack for the movie Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. Many critics, myself included, often excoriate Glass for the lack of harmonic development in his pieces. Here, however, his stylistic signature does not severely detract from the pieces' sense of forward motion; each idea is repeated, true, but not so many times as to become tiresome. They all share a tone of brooding mixed with quiet menace that is quite striking. It helps that they are short pieces; none of the six movements is longer than three and a half minutes, and the second and fourth are barely more than a minute each.

I've been listening to the string version of ""Mishima"" for comparison, and I think it actually comes off slightly better on the saxophones. The constant eighth-note pulses that are so characteristic of Glass seem somehow more live played on winds, as do the ascending arpeggios. The performers do an excellent job of giving different emphases to each note in a phrase, making the smallest variation truly stand out. The string version, by contrast, has a certain homogeneity that renders the pieces more emotionally distant.

The next work, also by Glass, is simply entitled ""Saxophone Quartet,"" and it is a somewhat strangely organized four-movement piece. The first movement is sad and minor. The main melody carried on the soprano sax is lyrical enough, but the accompaniment is generally uninspired. As a longer work, around five and a half minutes, it does suffer from a bit of that Glassian repetitiveness, as certain segments are heard several times without adding anything to the musical or emotional impact on the listener. The second movement is considerably more energetic and daring (part of the reason why the overall organization of the movements is confusing); it evokes imagery of scaling a great but precarious height, the excitement and tension building and building until a final explosion of melodic energy sends it all tumbling down. The ensemble works together more effectively here; rather than one instrument having the melody while the others play repeating patterns, there is a great deal of trading back and forth, and phrases of powerful homophony as well, particularly towards the end. Unfortunately, the third movement is both the longest and the dullest. It has neither the excitement of the second nor the lyricism of the first. Glass also returns to a much more straightforward arranging technique for much of the movement, with each of the players getting their turn having the primary melody, while the others play the same old interlocking pulse pattern. There is a new melodic idea introduced briefly about three-quarters of the way through, but then it disappointingly leads to nothing more than one more time through the main theme.

Luckily, the fourth movement makes up for the flaws in the rest of the longer work, and then some. It is amazing, probably my single favorite piece by Glass. The stuttering, syncopated rhythmic motive is inseparable from the driving melodic line, that here undergoes actual transformation and development as the piece goes on. The melodic statements are interspersed with swirling loops and turns in a new register and instrument, and these transitions are organic, vital, and varied. Because this movement has some actual structure and meaningful form to it, the restatement of the main theme, when it occurs, feels like an actual arrival, not simply another repetition. The climax features some striking dynamic changes, with sudden quiet moments that are in turn overwhelmed by storms of very fast runs on the bari sax, all leading to a strong and explosive conclusion that hits like a ton of bricks. Why can't Glass write more pieces that are this well put together?

Michael Nyman's collection ""Songs for Tony,"" also a four-movement work, begins very promisingly. In the first movement, Nyman sets up a powerful, swift-moving minor mode riff that juxtaposes the high and low registers of the ensemble. The energy of the original hook never relents, but the melody that emerges and is carried primarily by the tenor sax is surprisingly sensitive and touching. The warm, Renaissance-like concluding cadence is a nice touch as well.

The other three movements, regrettably, never attain the same vitality as the first. They tread by-now familiar sax quartet territory, with melodies and harmonies that are at best clichd and at worst simply plodding. The third movement's main theme is memorable, even catchy, but the transformations it undergoes are unconvincing and ultimately not very, well, transformative. While in the fourth movement, Nyman aims for real subtlety with an extremely quiet main melody in the bari sax, that is only lightly accompanied. The patience required to wait while the piece slowly builds is not rewarded by anything particularly revelatory, however, only more of the same, with an inconclusive, anemic ending that feels more like someone simply shut off the mikes in the studio, rather than a real conclusion.

Speaking of microphones and studios... as someone whose main training is in composition, most of my thinking when I hear a new album goes towards the architecture of the pieces and the like, but of course there are purely production-oriented considerations to take into account as well. The truth is, while the album's performances didn't detract from my enjoyment of the pieces, neither did they enhance it. Although both the playing and the engineering are smooth and competent, with even very subtle key-clicks and the like rendered expertly and audibly, there is a slight lack of crispness to some of the articulations that make already slow pieces bog down a bit. The exception, as noted above, is the rendering of the beautiful main melody of the first movement of ""Songs For Tony."" Which brings me back around full circle, and leads me to conclude that the performances were really dictated by the strengths and weaknesses of the compositions--but that could just be my personal bias.

The Sonic Art Quartet's album is, overall, pleasant but uneven. The second and third works presented have beautiful moments, but in most of the cases there is too much dead air between them to allow the music as a whole to come alive. For fans of the original version of the ""Mishima"" quartet, the reworking for saxophones is worth hearing, and the strongest movements of each of the two other offerings deserve to be entered into the canon of literature for the sax quartet. But there is a great deal of skippable material here as well, and all but the most completionist of listeners will want to acquire individual tracks rather than the whole thing.

"New Wave Rave Fans of modern music looking for something new should give a listen to the Sonic Art Saxophone Quartet, which sounds like nothing else on the alt-classical landscape. The four members of this tight little outfit conjure an amazing range of tonalities and timbres, far beyond what one might consider possible on the saxophone. The unusual instrumentation proves particularly apt for adventurous composers like Philip Glass and Michael Nyman, who are featured on this disc. The group's powerful yet supple sound perfectly evokes Nyman's poignant lyricism and the nervous intensity of Glass' passive-aggressive sonic structures. Intricate, beautiful and hypnotic, this music will take the listener on unexpected and joyous journeys.",1
"Nice try... but failed There's about 2 cadences I would listen to twice. The rest suck. And if you are looking at this for running, there's so many tracks that talk on and on before the cadence kicks in. Very distracting",0
"I loved this classic CBC program.  I wish shows like this still existed. Clyde Gilmour's show was wonderful because you never knew what you were going to hear next.  He might start with Mozart, followed by an operatic piece and then a track from a spoken word recording.  After that you could locomotive sounds, jazz, or maybe a comedy piece.  There was always insightful commentary as well.  I'll always recall hearing all or part of his weekly show when we would return from Church.  There are few if any shows like this today.  We now have programs and even entire channels devoted to very specific genres.  But Gilmour's Albums did not exist in the era of hundreds of channels or the Internet.  You had far fewer choices then, so variety shows were very practical.  This CD captures some of the hosts favourite pieces along with his own words.  Theme music from the show is included.",1

"I WANT A CD VERSION Dear Amazon:

I want a CD version of this album for the following reasons:

1. BIGGEST REASON: When I download the mp3 version to my PC I make a backup using a blank CD. However when I do this and move it to another PC or other device all the tracks show up as track 1, track 2 etc. So I have to go and label all the tracks so I know which one is which. Worst of all there is no picture of the album when I put it into Windows Media player. Yes I actually care that the picture is not there. I know Windows Media player can try and find the picture online but it almost always doesn't find the right one. This is why I want the CD version so bad.

2. When I rip a CD to my computer i want to be able to choose the format it gets ripped in.(mp3, wma, FLAC and so on).
3. CD has better audio quality than the mp3 version
4. I have to install software from amazon that is solely used for downloading the music and I don't like that.
5. If there was a CD version I would have bought this already.

So please, do whatever you got to do to get me a CD version of this available on your website. please do it and I will most definitely buy it. I prefer all my music to come from it's purest source. the CD. I don't care if it costs a bit more I'm totally fine with that. If you can't do this than please tell me where I can get the CD version. (If there is one)If there isn't then have whoever makes this make CD versions.",0

"Bloodless This recording was a disappointment. Telemann's music demands more than timid scraping and blowing.  I do not see the faults displayed here as endemic to HIP style performances, though they are common: a generally bloodless and etiolated style of playing, with absence of attack, limited dynamic range, an absence of any discernible commitment to or involvement with what is being played.  It's like viewing a landscape through a shower curtain or sitting through a sight-reading exercise. NOT recommended",0

It would be nice if he could write some new music that was as good as he wrote back in the late 70's through the 80's. Most new albums are just recompilations of other good songs he wrote before. This one is new to me, but not to great. I hope he'll get the spark back that he had before.",0

"Harsh sounding except for spectacular Piano Counterpoint I'm a fan of Reich, but I never liked the Triple Concerto and found Different Trains to be a bit taxing, though the first part of its three has held my interest over the years.  Here, the Triple Quartet sounds harsh.  Now, harshness is a quality that might actually be a great addition to Different Trains considering the subject matter.  In this particular instance, that harshness continues but somehow the sound lacks depth.  I don't hear the trains in the music as I do on the version from the Different Trains/Electric Counterpoint album.  Maybe I'm just partial to the versions I heard originally and new ones just don't compare.

In any case, the whole point of my review is the stunning Piano Counterpoint.  This piece is new to me and this might be the only place where it's been recorded.  Vincent Corver's arrangement brings tremendous life to Reich's style.  It's as if he really ""gets"" Reich.  Dare I say he might have even improved on it?  This is a lively, happy, well-played and enjoyable piece and out of character with the rest of the music on this album.  Because you can buy each track individually, I opted to buy just this one and I'm very happy to hear it bouncing off my walls.  If you're a Reich fan, don't miss this stunning track.  2 stars for the album, 5 stars for Piano Counterpoint.",0

"An awesome single for an awesome band! GLMET is a all female Japanese melodic death metal band, I've also seen they like to say they are ""Moe"" (probably spelt wrong) for cute death metal. But they are a pretty awesome band, but are Independent so getting their stuff could be hard but worth while to buy.

This single you get three songs AND a music video for Rebirth! But the music video isn't on a separate disc, its in the regular cd, and if you want to put it on IPhones, tablets etc. you can just open up the CD on your computer and drag and drop the file to desktop. But it wouldn't work for my windows media player, but it works on quicktime.
1) Rebirth
2) Last Words
3) While There's Life

"Shuffled Flamenco In case you're not familiar with Sabicas (1912-90), he was one of the greatest flamenco guitarists of the 20th century and a major influence on all his successors, most notably Paco de Luca.

Confusingly, this 3-volume set is not the same is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B004AE402G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>&nbsp;3-volume set of the same name, from 1958-59.  Instead it appears to be a rag-bag of tracks drawn principally from two albums:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flamenco-Fantasy/dp/B001O0HZDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flamenco Fantasy</a>&nbsp;(1960) and the double-album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabicas-in-Concert/dp/B0013KSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabicas in Concert</a>&nbsp;(1972)

As to Vol. 2, ""Alambra"" should be ""Alhambra"" (the Moorish palace in Granada).  El Pillallo (or Piyayo, 1864-1940) was a well-known and popular singer/guitarist from Mlaga.  The occurrence of two pieces with the same title but different styles seems to be an oversight on Sabicas's part, as his titles were usually unique.

It's nearly all good stuff, if you don't mind the albums being garbled together.  Since Amazon doesn't list the flamenco styles of the tracks, I do so below:

01. Rondea Llanto Minero
02. Tarantas Llanto Minero
03. Buleras
04. Buleras II
05. Granadinas Patio de Los Leones
06. Rondea Sentimiento
07. Malaguea Homenaje a Mlaga
08. Granadinas Joyas de la Alhambra
09. Malagueas El Pillallo
10. Soleares
11. Alegras Puerto Santa Mara

The total time is 44'22"".

I don't understand why they didn't just reissue the original LPs.  I suppose I must be stupid.",1

"Mr. Rivers keeps building New Homes and Hits Say Hey Gang,
For all of you Johnny Rivers fans out there, JR is back!! On July 4, 1964, Mr. Rivers claimed the #2 spot on Cashbox's Top 100 Hit Parade with Memphis. It's November 2010...some 46 years later and JR is still delivering music with the voice that is still as strong and powerful as it was on all of those hits from yesteryear. Grab the mouse, click on the download button, and let Mr. Rivers show you how it's done. New Home is a great tune...let's hope it gets some radio airplay...which it deserves!!",1

"A Solid Must Have For A Serious Jazz Library One of the true unsung artist of his era. This is his second album as leader and is on the renown Blue Note Label. Trying to find this on vinyl is all but impossible. But thankfully Blue Note finally found the lost tapes and reissued this on vinyl sometime back.

Track Listing:

1  Good Old Soul
2  Up Tight's Creek
3  Theme For Doris
4  True Blue
5  Miss Hazel
6  Nothing Ever Changes My Love For You

The Sextet:

Tina Brooks - Tenor Sax
Freddie Hubbard - Trumpet
Duke Jordan - Piano
Sam Jones - Bass
Art Taylor - Drums

Recorded 1960 on the Blue Note Label. This reissue carries catalog number 4041.

Review:

As with Minor Move and Back to the Tracks, Tina Brooks' True Blue is an album of hard bop excellence. Recorded in '60, it finds the tenor saxophonist accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet (a week after Brooks helped Hubbard on his debut album, Open Sesame), Duke Jordan on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The six original compositions by Brooks are well-crafted, though none are stellar. The group's cohesive sound, its consistent blues-induced jazz groove, and the numerous well-defined solos are the album's strengths.

You'd never know it from listening to his distinctive tone and melodic attitude, but Brooks never made it big. Though he recorded four albums for Blue Note, True Blue was the only one that was released during his lifetime. I'll health and drugs eventually took their toll and he passed away in '74 at 42 years of age.

There is a terrifically pensive blues cry in every Brooks solo on this release that is mesmerizing. While he's often shadowed by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, the two gracefully bring out some profoundly thoughtful improvising from each other. None of the five tunes (and two alternative takes) are exactly inspiring tunes. But Brooks packs a lot of raw emotionality and innovative musical craft into his solos. Although the liner notes makes much of the Sonny Rollins influence, I actually hear a lot more of a tone I'd connect to Booker Erwin, Ornette Coleman, or Brooks' companion in the Blue Note recording studio, Jackie McLean. Anyone who enjoyed the dramatic support Brooks gave McLean on Jackie's Bag should treasure this, the only album Brooks released under his name as leader during his lifetime. Brooks sounds like a desperately driven musician wanting something beyond the bop of 1960 and never quite making the breakthrough to freedom that McLean found through his association with Ornette Coleman. The rhythm section of drummer Art Taylor, bassist Sam Jones, and pianist Duke Jordan simply never push him that hard to explore new musical territory. I wonder who Brooks would have become had he worked with a drummer like Eddie Blackwell or Elvin Jones.

What True Blue gives generously is a full blooded musical portrait of a hard-working and distinctive sounding tenor man with a blue cry stuck in his throat and heart. It is an achievement to treasure.

End Review:

I could not agree more with the above two reviews. If you do not have Tina Brooks in your jazz library, you have missed on of the all time greats. While Tina Brooks does not have a large body of work and he ceased recording in 1961, ""True Blue"" remains on of those tour de force recordings to be treasured forever.

View the pics and decide for yourself. This belongs in any jazz library of substance.",1
"Nothing ""wrong"" but nothing right. As a child of the 80's I always have a soft spot for Cyndi Lauper.
But this song just doesn't do it. It doesn't represent her music well, and it doesn't represent Christmas music well. I don't see myself ever listening to the song again unless it comes up randomly in a shuffle.",0

"Good Music, Great Energy; Can't Wait to see them LIVE!!! My friend told me these guys are going to be playing a set with their band, so I checked them out... picked up this album today and already listened at least three times. Really good song writing, my favorite is track 1 but the whole album is worth a listen; and I can already tell its going to be a fun show!",1

"Great Singer/Songwriter, Great Album I remember when I bought this cassette (I know, I know...what is a cassette) after seeing the band a small bar in Redondo Beach. Everyone was drinking (including me), but I kept looking over at the band thinking, damn, these guys are pretty good. Anyway, I wore out this cassette in my walkman while I rode my bicycle up and down the So Cal coastal cities of Torrance, Redondo, Hermosa, El Segundo, etc. It is a great combo of songs that will sink into your heart & soul. Many years have gone by, and I am re-discovering Andy & his musical friends, Renee Safier and Hard Rain. I am going to their Dylanfest concert on Sat, May 19th, 2012. Any ideas on how do you get an autograph on an MP3?",1
One Star Got screwed on this....the there is no song.,0
"Ambient Nirvana SKaynan's EP is a lush, cosmic, bittersweet epic of electronic mood and sound. While mostly being ""chillout ambient"", there are added elements of lounge and breakbeat amongst other things. The album showcases Kaynan's musical sophistication and amazing feel for melody without gimmickry.",1
"Not Enough Santana I have a collection of Glee tracks & while they top my list of things I don't want to get caught listening to at work, there's a lot of good stuff that's been on the show. That is, outside the wasteland that was most of season 3 spent in a black hole of uninspired Broadway selections. In this case, there are a couple decent vocal performances to this track, but I find that I listen to the first minute and a half of this until Rachael comes in.",0

"Love this song and album Love this song and album.  I had the great pleasure to see him perform this live.  He is such a gracious performer, he came up to us after his show before he left the stage and hugged our son,who is severely handicapped and wheelchair bound, and then he hugged each of us.  He made us feel like he knew about our pain and struggles with the blessed cross that we live with every day. Truly felt like he was singing this song to us.",1
Like the song we used it for a funeral We really liked the song and used it for a funeral.  It is more of a gospel song rather than a country song.  It has a beautiful piano accompaniment to it.,1
so beautiful! takes my breath away..so beautiful!,1
"Great bluegrass/roots song There are several versions of this song out by different artists, but I like this one best.  It's got a more raw, roots feel to it, like I'm hearing it in an old wooden church out in the woods.  Great uplifting song for someone who is going through troubled times, or just to remind you how good your life really is.",1
Ruined by loud jolting electronic segments I saw Marti live and loved her music and voice. I purchased this album hoping for more of that same sound. The songs start off nice but then she inserts loud electronic segments that jolt you out of the beauty of the meditative sounds. Totally ruins the songs. Too bad because she was really good live without all the loud electronic noise.,0
"If your into trance - it would be good, if your not, don't bother. I bought this as somebody had recommended it.  Unfortunately I didn't get to listen first.  The musicians are obviously very talented, but unless you are into non-stop fast trance like noisy beat music, you won't like it.  No disrespect meant to those that do, just try and listen before you buy. I rarely make these mistakes.",0

"not edited for children I bought this to play at an elementary school.  I wasn't familiar with a lot of the songs, but I thought they would be appropriate for children since this was supposed to be for kids.

I ended up only able to use about half of what I planned to use.",0

"Over and over and over... McCombs' `The Same Thing' is an interesting track.  There are moments, especially towards the chorus breakdown where it sounds like a stolen beat from a 70's sitcom.  There are moments when the vocals reach a fluidity that causes the words to meld together to the point where it doesn't sound like English anymore.  The base musicality has a bouncy folksiness to it that resembles a down-tuned Mumford and Sons.  The lead vocal is slightly too monotone to illicit a direct response from the eardrums, but then again as he speaks in tongues and rips off a whistle for a beat he resembles a smoothness reminiscent of famed hair bands of the 80's.  The overall sound is extremely dated though.  At the end of the day, `The Same Thing' feels too uneven for its own good, and it certainly outstays its welcome by stretching itself over six minutes in length.  Still, there is something interesting at play here.

I don't really like this, but I'm intrigued enough to listen to more.",0
Five Stars thanks.,1
"Great Song, Well Worth The Purchase! Every once in a  while you come across a song that really touches your heart and stays with you for a long time.

I listen to a lot of new music and when I heard this song I was certain I had to buy it.",1
Timeless Rock Music!!! There's nothing I like to hear more than well put-together records now-a-days and this one is just that....pieced well together!

"A nice little contemporary ditty. Eric Roberson's song ""At The Same Time"" is the definition of dreamy. It has nice vocals, production and the lyrics are relatable to anyone who is loving someone that just isn't loving them.

"BEWARE!!!  Totally misleading.  NOT the whole box set!!!  Only 3 of the 7 discs included.  1 of the 3 parts to the box set!!! I am Very Disappointed.

There was no description to Describe that it was only an incomplete part of the whole box set, and only 1 picture!!  So very disappointed!!

The only plus is that it's Pearl Jam, and it is extremely hard to go wrong with Pearl Jam.

But now I have to shell out even more, in order to get the Whole Box Set, which I will now have a redundant 1/3 of it.",0
