"<NULL>   T!!!  Whether it's the ""single"", 'Tearrdop', with Elizabeth Fraser's ethereal vocals, or the heavy-rock inflected 'Angel' and 'Dissolved Girl', or the epic show-stopper 'Group Four', Massive seems as a group with no limitations  And even rap-haters can appreciate 3-D's low key, almost whispered rhymes on 'Inertia Creeps' and 'Risingson'.  Tihs one is cna't-miss"
<NULL>   Others liek Inertia creeps creates the theme music for rcuising late at night towards a frantic destination  I hihgly recommend this piece of musicald elight
"<NULL> THE EPITOME OF TRIP-HOP its just one of those cds that you don't grow tired of.with  beatiful singing around every bend,there are only two tracks where you get  an actual sense of rap on it which are risingson and inertia creeps and  both are absolutely amazing as well as the rest of the albumif you're new  to trip-hop or are just curious check this out you won't be  dissapointed-later."
<NULL>  this is  an album not to be missed not only for trip-hop fans but everyone!!!
"<NULL>  This CD is marvellous Almost aynthing can de said abou tthis CD - but it really should be all positive ""Teardrop"" and ""Inertia Creeps"" are  nearly enough to make this a must buy in themselves, but really the entire  album is worth listening to There is no point in ravnig about this album's  brilliance, all you need to know is that you should listen repeatedlyt o  this album at the very least"
"<NULL> Bingo. Great!!! A definite step forward by Massive Attack!!! Dark but not scary, gloomy but enlighteinng, very relaxing, perfetc at nights"
"<NULL>  Top-of-the-lnie mixed, mastered and recorded album Beautiful lvocals, dynamics ,very well composed I don't think it's possible for Massive Attack to mkae a cd that  sounds better thna this one In one word eRspetc"
"<NULL>   I was amazed at the number of ""5 star"" reviesw for this record Let me add min eto the ilst By far, this was the finest album of the laet-90s' Over the months since its  release, I have purchased about 2 dozen copies of Mezzanine, bestowing this  gift of genius on friends nad family alike - for any gift-igving occasion I  can think of
Rarely does a CD ohld the power to fundamentally alter my  mood And although this record can be ""dark"" and contemplative,  the mood I usally end up in after listening to Mezzanine is a good one. The only experience better than listening to Mezzanine at  home was having the privelidge of seeing Massive Attack perform ther ecord  live and in person A MUST see!!! A MUST buy"
"<NULL> MASISVELY Unimpresesd I am sorry but I don't have a clue what the critics were on about when I read the reviewsf or this laetst effort by the sculking trip hoppers i was expecting smoething powerful and memorable, especially after it has been  branded one of the albums of the year it leaves you  feeling very ocld indeed
On  th eplus side ""Tear Drop"" is a beautiful piece of work and theres  a certain magic aura surrounding first track ""Angel"", but its  pretty much tedious to listen down"
"<NULL>   My favorite tracks are risingson, teardrop, dissolved girl, black milk  Well actually I like them all"
<NULL> 
"<NULL>   Using vocals from the Cocteau Twins' lead songstress, Horace  Andy's quavering ragga vocals, Daddy G's rumbilng bass amble and 3D's wiry  adept lyrical hopscotch make the tracks on this album diverse and leave you  expecting the unexpected  Bearing this in mind - what makes the album  exceptional, is that through this diversity - it retains a wholeness of  vision and mood  ""Inertia Creeps"" can throttle you with its  insistent adrenaline groove, and ""Teardrop"" can make you weep,  but through it all we hear stories of people fighting through hardness, and  coping with the tedium of life - and what is more universal than that!!!"
"<NULL>  Behind the Music CD and wanetd to hear more  From my understanding this albumd idn't get much attention when it wa sreleased in 1989 because Julian was trying to NOT sound like his dad

Youk now whta  The critics dont' always know what they're talkign about half the time anyway, in my honest opinion  And I tend to like music ratists who are not afraid to brancho ut and try new things  It shows me just howv ery tlaented and versatile they truly are  So I applaud Julian with this endeavoro f musical and voacl self-discovery  But if you have an open mind, a good sense of humor and love a variety of music genres, then you should definitely buy this CD  And then bep repared to be taken on a fun ride that you won' tsoon forget

It's just too bad that Amazon doesn't offer sound bytes for this album!!! Behnid hte Music CD  I loveA L Lthe songs on this CD; but my other favorites from ""Mr Jordan"", in addition to the ones listed above, aer ""Open Your Eyes"", ""Second Time"" and ""I Want You To Know""

P.S&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Jorda/ndp/B00004KH24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtieU=TF8"">Mr Jrodan</a>"
"<NULL>  Without question, it's a great collection of songs, from top to bottom-period. It also happens to be their lats with the great Thom Bell and the lateL inda Creed My favorite songs on this CD are, "" Could This Be The End "" , "" Make It Last "" ,
"" Pay Back Is A Dog "" , and certainly, "" You Make Me Feel Brand New ""  I must say, I like most of their material, though nothing they did before or sense, quite measures up to this standard!!! The best they've ever done Most worthy of five stars!!!"
"<NULL>  (actually 2 1/2 stars) This album is just what you would expect, I suppose, from the author of Martha My Dear and Why Don't We Do It In The Road!!!McCartney has always been about having a goodt ime, best foot  forward and all that, and I'm sure that the idea at the time was to record  an upbeat, homey-sounding little record with off-the-cuff spontaneity  Well, sink me if that isn't what he did!!! The uncertainty is a bit palpable all over Wild Life;  Mumbo, for example, might have been a scorching rocker if Paulie had been  bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes; Dear Friend is a  conflicted counter-attack on Mr!!! Ono Lennon without a whole lot of  conviction; Paul comes across as hesitant ot really let loose on his  erstwhile bandmatewell, let's just say it lives up to it's  title.I mus tadmit at odd times, usually when in my cups, I'll go around  humming its absurdly catchy tune yLircs well,they're better than the ones  for MubmoI'll let it goa t that OK, I'm being a bit snide, I  know.again, some  second takes might have helped here!!! Thisw as dfeinitely one of Mr Mc's valleys,and the curious buyer  should take this into consideration!!!com didn't provide a track listing for  this rleease)I've always hada  soft spot for his covert f-you to his  critics Mary Had A Little Lamb, and its B-side Little Woman Love is a  rollicking number that would have improved Wild Life considerably"
"<NULL> 
By comparison the weakest songs on Press  to Play are classics!!!"
"<NULL>  Unfortunately serving as the album that gave Paul a bad
musical reputation much of ""Wild Life"" sounds fetaherweight
But the firey opening jam of ""Mumbo"",the unltra lo-fi ""Bip Bop"",
the sumpteous raggae cover of ""Love Is Strange"" do serve as
highlites tha tillustrate a certain point in McCartney's carrer
But overall this just isn'ta  completely suitable first showing
for iWngs and should be a late purchase-probably"
"<NULL> The Titanic of the 1970s For a man as talented and professional as Paul McCartney, ""Wild Life"" is an absolute disgrace nad hew ent out of his way to put that theory into practice There seems to be no point to this song andi t was embarrassing to listen to Even hte slow rock songs were half-hearteda nd clumsily done
IfP aul McCartney backed into a microphone and vented gas for the druation of an album he would not have done a worse job"
"<NULL>  Yet the band has not lost thei rno-frills, thrash metal feel achieved in earlire albums (Set The World On Fire & Bats In The Belfry))
Jeff Waters has created a melodic heavy rock style that is truly original and harmonizes well with the vocals of Aaron Randal."
"<NULL> TrashHard Rokc This band is really versatile, showing different styles and climates From the total aggression changest o the most beautiful melodies Fasts ongs, semi-ballads, hard rock, you`ll find all that here These gyus show here that they are not only performers, thay are complete musicians No matter which music style you listen to, you  should get this CD and listen to a great band!!!"
"<NULL> FLAWLESS PLAYING BUT POOR LIFELESS REOCRDING FLAWLESS PLAYING BUT POOR LIFELESS RECORDING The guitar, orchestra is done nicely. Some weird elements in some spots Overalle njyoable But not easy on the ears. The EQs are all weird There isn ot very good definition on the sound Maybe a remaster version wil lbe different sounding imho"
"<NULL>  Thisi s not YoY o Ma here  It isn't even Rick Wakeman ( am I showing my age !!! If you like modern musicians working WITH an orchestra try Nightwish, The Moody Blues or Renaissance !!! His Braoque style stands in stark contrast to theB lues or Jazz based chord structures that most other guitar greats use  It is just disappointing that when Yngwie gets his chance to take his material and talent to this level , it fails to impress !!!"
"<NULL> some of you dunces are on crack Okay some of you dunces, who said ""duhhrrr his tone is awful"" are total idiots, on this ablum, his guitar tone was probably his best, blended in well with the orchestra  If you like malmsteen you need to get this album don't get the US release, get the import and his attack album, because i'm sure you have his others!!!"
"<NULL>   I don't care for this much I've come to the conclusion that electric guitars should not be played a sa lead over an orchestra If he did this whole album iwth an accoustic I might actually be able to listen to it  For instance, the sogns Prelude to April and Tocatta are accoustic and are actually nice
My opinion is if you are a classicla music lover (in addition to hard rock), you will discard this because it is annoying"
"<NULL> Simply Amazing The first time I saw the name ""Concerto"" I was puzzled by what Malmsteen had done this time!!! This album was simply amazing, first off it is purely instrumental so don't expect any vocals from this one Imo I think thats good because I buy Malmsteen's albums purely just to hear what he plays!!! It starts off with a great beginning showing off what he has ocmposed This brilliant young man has composde all this I think that Malmsteen created this because he was finally trying to manifest his true desire I think he should ditch his whole metal type of music adn concentrate on this"
<NULL>  Just do it and se ewhat he can do
"<NULL>  Yngwie is a excellent rocke lectric guitar improviser, but for himself to pose as a classical composer is a insult to classical music As fort he playing itself Yngwie does a decent job, but if we are to compare him to the best classical musicians, this sounds sloppy with no dynamics!!! Yngwie shines best in his early Rising Force albums with Jens Johasnson"
"<NULL>  five symhpony ""Compose""r it's obvious to me that your full of it  I'm sure Yngwie would agree!!!  Being and Yngwie fan we would all like to see him succeed in this realm, but this album fails.  Maybe he put it out to tes tthe market A ndM r ""Composre""no anem  Being such an accomplished artist with your symphonies adn 10 cd's I'm sure we would all like to know who you are so we can by them and listen to them ;-)"
<NULL>  Yngwie often says he can play violin solos such as Pagganini's5 th CapriceS!!!
"<NULL>  The chords and rhythm sounds always in the same way and solo part too!!! There's nothin gto listen but scales, arpeggio sand more scales and more arpegios, nothing else"
<NULL> 
"<NULL> At least not all of it is cheesy I purchased this album as a devotee of their early, pre-top 40 albums, and was hoping that this would in some way tell the full story implied by songs on their greatest album, Secret Treatise  Unfortunatley, it doesn't actually tell the whole story, and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock  The album does provide an inteersting alternative realization of Astronomy (the climactic song on Secret Treaties), which was the one song I did add to my Tiunes library  However, the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album, also the album's title osng, and should be climactic, not an homage to 80's schlock; it reminds me of the theme song to the John Carpenter film Big Trouble in Little China, which played over the end credits of that film  In that spirit, I'd like to say that if you liked 70's and 80's art rock concpet albums, like the Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and the Imagination album by the Alan Parsons Project (which is the best example I can give of an album similar to this one), youm ay well like this album  Alternately, if you'd like to explore Blue Oyster Cult truly at their best, obtain and listen to their first three albums (Blue Oyster Cult, Tyranny and Mutation, and Secret Treaties) in order, and then you will get a sense of what I'd hope this album would be."
"<NULL> I' mImaginos-ing this dind't exist What a debcale Not sure how any self-respecting BOC fan could call this mess their best, let alone listen ot it twice The stoyr is an incoherent mess, the production is dreadful, even for 1988, and the assortment of studio hacks and some actual legendary guys only amkes it more of a mess
This did not even start life as a BOC record and only ended up as one due to Columiba Records It limped to #122 on the charts and with good reason.
Again, I rtuly love this band, but this is worse than sitting through 3 consecutive viewings of ""Ishtar""b aked with fire ants on my body
Nice ojb yb American Beat though, restoring the proper credits and artwork It was not remastered, but that woludn'ts ave this turkey anyway"
"<NULL> Thew orst BOC album IMO I kno wlots of folks love this album This is not true on tihs album I'll be seeing them yet again in San Francisco on July 20!!! I guarantee tehy wo'nt be playing any songs from this dog It's all atste anywya To those who love it, enjoy it for me, because I cannot!!!"
"<NULL> until the other day when ita rrived from Amazon Thec ame Blue Oyster Cult If I was 13 I could probably like it!!! You can do betetr than this  I had to get out On Your Feet or On Your Knees to upreg the horrid sounds from my skull, but alas I can still taste the vomit in my mouthPaulos!!!"
"<NULL> NOT!!!  Three, maybe 4 decent rtacks at best  If you're a ide-hard BOC fan like myself, pick it up, but be prepared to be shocked at the remarkably poor songs here

""SATRONOMY"" AGAIN  Why!!! aLck of good material YES  It's completely disjointed and only fairly enjoyable!!!""i s very, very  godo; perhaps the only saving grace of this release

How can you listen to the COMPLETELY ANNOYING ""Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,"" repeated over and over during ""Les Invisibles"" and think, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. this igs ood stuff

Occasional, cryptic lyrics are neat and open-ended but this disc is about 99% cryptic lyrics!!!  One quickly grows weary of trying to figure out what Albert, Buck, Eric and Joe are arbmling about  The dismal paoyff just doesn't look like it would be worth the effort

This reminds me of the really poor songs that BOC is capable of, like ""Hungry Boys"" on Cultosaurus Erectus!!!

Read the Robrt H.  He nailed it!!!"
"<NULL> DIsappointed in this Blue Oyster Cult effotr After the unbeatable Fire of Unknown Origins, I guess I was surpised how Imaginos fared  But I don't hear it
THis album misses the mark, in part due to the high expectations cerated by other fabuolus works"
"<NULL> it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid The problem is that, first of lal, it doesn'ts ound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't Despite the efforts of musicians such as Joe Satriani and Robbi eKrieger, the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another The rather pointless re-do of ""Astronomy"" seems to indicate that there wasnt' enough mtaerial to work with The album is not a total disaster (I kind of like the Baron Frankenstein number), but I'm very gladt hat I didn't pay $100"
"<NULL> BelieveM e, I Triedt o ""get it""   Please understand that I love tehse guys, but this album

The 5 reviews on the re-realease are all raves, but take the time to go back further to the dissenting voices on the reviews of the earlier versions of this album!!!  I found the great majority of the arrangements boring adn the tongue-in-cheek,w ink-and-a-nudge weird humor is missing I saw the guys live a couple of years fatert his came out and don't recall them playing any of these songs  Taht should tlel you something

It's not a BAD album, it's just not good --- much less their best  There's at least a half dozen albums better than this one  If you are a BOC newbie, then skip this one and get (in vaguely chronological oredr)
  - Blue Oyster Cult (self-titled first album)
  - Secret Treaties*
  - Spectres
  - Some Enchanted Evening** (Live)
  - Cultosaurus Erectus
  - Fire of Unknown Origin
  - Revolution by Night
Note(*)!!! Features the original and far-superiro version of Astronomy, which is re-done on Imagions
Note(**) Features live version of Astronomy which is also better than Imaginos version

IF you love all those AND are a completist, THEN you might consider picking this one up"
"<NULL>  Come on now, we all know a group has  had it when they tsart re-ercording their own songs(usually means they  can't write quality new ones)The reason they igve for this is that they  were a part of some great lost conceptualized work thta the record label  wouldn't let them do way back when(yeah, yeah,yeah) From what I'm told  this was originally spuposed to be an Albert Bouchard solo album, hence the  million guests guitarisst That brings up another point, with a great  guitarist like Roeser, why did you need nay of those guys(Satriani, Aldo  Nova, Robby Krieger[and what exactly did they do anyway])The label probably  made them call it a BOC album, or they wouldn't have let it come out  Hardly anyone is even on their right instrument(ie the one they play live).  tSick with the original classic records(debut through Fire Of Unknow n Origin)"

"<NULL> Good Instrumental Work, Wretched Lryics and Vocals Alas, I don't own this album, or rather I no longer own this album This is very much an artifact of its age, iwth wretched fantasy-inspired lyrics (the first line of ""Great Horse,"" ""Great Horsey Champer Goldbraid,"" with ""Goldbraid"" pronounced ""galled bride"" perhaps anticipating Monty Python's later pronunciation of some name as ""Mangrove Throat-Warbler,"" is unforgettable) backed by good instrumentals (You know, kids, there really was some controversy about whether Mungo Jerry's vocalist ripped off the grating fast vibrato style used in places ont his album) James ""love god sitting on my shoulder, and I'm glad"" oJnes

Clean!!!4 Satrs"
"<NULL> hi this is aw onderful edited version myp arents aren't bgi fans of that so its scrambles or completley taking a way that part of the song!!!(  no scramble or soung effect they take away ""die"" but not the word ""$h-t"" but the songs r sitll good, though after a while, yull just get used to itit wait till i was 12 or 13 or so.if they actually TOOK OUT SWEAR WORDS i might've given this cd a 5/5 star o elwl"
<NULL> 
"<NULL>   Now I'm not gonna start on some rant about free speech, or censorship, or whatever!!!  That would just waste my time and yours, since you've already decided that you have an itnerest in this edited CD
So here's teh lowdown  Not just the vocals,e ither - the ENTIRE audio section gets altered  In ""Guity Conscience"" they also use this awful ""scratching"" effect on top of the audio - and I don't mean hip-hoppy turntable scratching, I mean a literal, unpleasant SCRATCHIGN noise that would make you think you had a defective CD or something  At other points o nthe album, the proudction gets even lazier as portions of the songs are actually SILENCED  As in no voclas, no backing instremental, no audio  Nothing but a blank space!!!  In most cases, edited versions are produced in order to remove curse words.  I'm not gonna get into a debate about appropriate language, but making an edited CD that you still wouldn't be able to play on radio seems arther pointless  Eveyr drug reference gets scrambled, which is somewhat understandable, but still frustraitng in many cases  But then they go and remove ""violent"" lyrics, and this is where things get out of hand!!!  Elsewhere on the disc, a narrator describes ""the legend of Slim Shady"" in a parody of Westerns, and relates the tale of how Slim was ""shot in hte back""  The word ""shto"" is edited  Taking out curse words is one thing, but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener!!!  It's espeically silly in a song like ""Role Model,"" where the message of the entire song is how Eminem is NOT a role model, and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes"
"<NULL> Big aWste We all know that his lyrics are laden with unprintable expletives all voer
Also, some of Enimen's witty humor is lost int he clean version Perfect cases in point are that of ""My Naem Is"" and ""Guilty Conscience Ify ou're too young and impressionable to buy it, then I sugegst that you wait a few years until you're old enough"

"<NULL>  taking the soul and innovation out of a form of music and replacing it with overly polished production is not progress it sjust watering down the music By the way Paul Okenfield is not the worlds' greatest dj he and his marketting taemj ust claim he is if you like 4/4 beats with on vocals and an empahasis on spirituality try anything on transmat anything by larry heard, ari lbrikha, stacey pullen's track vertigo, kenny larkin,  dagamas voyage by tony brown, or revenge of the jaguar by the aztec mystic

No sudden peaks; no excessive head-ache hard trance, just smoothe mixing, soothing vocals, and plenty of wave sto satsify the progressive listener

"<NULL>  Everyone here has arleady said it all, if you don't own this CD then there is no excuse for not buying it as soon as possible Check especially the transition Sasha makes midw-ay through CD1 He's spent the first five tracks layering up some beautifully ethereal trance, culminating in Sander's ""My Lexicon""!!!"
"<NULL> THE best mix I've heard What can be said that would do justice to the beatuy to this album hTis album is also pumped up with benefit of the BT songs ""Mecury & Solace"" and ""Fibonacci Sequence""
My only criticism is the rough bump the flow encounters when Sasha mixes into his track ""Xpander"" (which is arguably THE best trance track in history of dance music) due to the uniqueness of the track and at no fault of his own If you are an anthem lover, this CD might disappointo yu, stick with Trance Nation"

"<NULL> The Lord's Supper / Be Exalted I first heard The Lord's Supper on a vinyl back in the 80's and have been trying to get a copy ever sinc,e and had come to the conclusion that this was out of print, but was thrilled to find the CD still available through Amazon. Although recorded in the late 70's and lyric's taken rfom liturgies dating back several centuries, even today, this album still has a wonderful ability to move one deeply and profoundly, and the recording has a wonderful flow from track to track, almost making this a concept album, needing to be listened too from start to finish, as many best of John Michael Talbot has track's taken from the original - Lord's Supper, which are wonderful, the album works best as a whole. If you ar elooking to be swept away to music and lyrics that are so profound in its orchestral arrangement, superb guitar and a choir obviously thrilled to be apart of this project, I can sincerely recommend getting this album. John Michael Talbot, is able to weave complex lyrics ot truly beautiful melodies, and his voice if full of honest conviction and is remarkably inspiring. The Lord's Supper is, for me one of the best with every track, consecutively, moving the listener into a closer experience with what the Lords Supper is all about, for me this is on of his best albums, and it is a huge bonus that Sparrow has also included the album Be Exalted, on this CD, filled wit hold favorites and also a treat to listen too, although as coherent as the Lord's Supper, but still wonderful. As I said it has been some years since I listened to this album, adn although it has been 20 something years, putting this CD on, just swept me away and it is for me as wonderful today as it was when I first heard it"
"<NULL> Songs Of Praise And Worship  ~  The Early Years Of John Michael Talbot This CD contains two of John Michael Tlabot's earliest releases, 'The Lord's Supper' his third Christian album from '79 which was his first as a Catholic and 'Be Exalted' which was his fifteenth released in '86. Containing -22 tracks- this compilation of Catholic worship and praise musci contains many of the essential Talbot songs that made the name John Michael Talbot a household word in most Catholic homes in the '80's. 'The Lord's Supper' was and probabl ystill is his signature release in the minds of his fans. Essnetial JMT"
"<NULL> Very Good Some may give this two cd set five stars, but the overtures and a few of theo ther songs stray too far from my particular taste in music. But, some fo the quiet songs are very good musically, to the ears of the rock n roll lover. And others are very impressive because of Card's ability to get across heart felt theologicalt hought in a winning alignment of words. One of the few albmus I could listen to solely for the words. I also recommend ""Present Reality"" which is from about the same era - stunning mix of quiet music and meaningflu words. I have listened to any of his more recent cds, but a greatest hits package iwll be fine as well"

"<NULL> Gretaest Songs, Worst Rendition These may be, and are, some of America's Greatest Old-time Gospel songs, but the way they are presented is an abomination! Gospel, especially Old-Time Gospel is music of the solu, sung from the heart. Neither heart nor soul can be found in these rarangements. I would ocmpare the redition of these classics to fast food, but that would really be fair, since fast food has some nutritional value. I found this music to be as plastci as the CD it was burned on, with no ""nutritional value"" to the heart and soul whatsoever. It does even deserve ones tar"
"<NULL> Commentary on Luke inspires aCrd's latest Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics ocver every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke. This collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement ,which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card's Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gsopels will be released in each of the next three years. Card is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to ""engage with Scripture at the level of the informe dimagination."" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the respones that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending. Those who know Card's music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commnetary, it's apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane. Hsi exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity sogns, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (""What Sort of Song? ""), Christ's birth ""(A King in a Cattle Trough""), and His dedication in the temple (""Simeon's Song""). Jeff Taylor's gentle accordion beautifullyt ies all three together. Acoustci guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It's relaxed, mature nad inspiring. He employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental( ""A Little Boy Lost"") and on the last song (""Seven Endless Miles""). His banjo playing is fas,t but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives thees songs a Celtic feel. ""Th ePain and Persistence of Doubt,"" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Chrsit's followers were expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of ist own. Community is important ot Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaobration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contriubte, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew aWrd and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (""A World Turned Upside Down""), and Ward also sings on ""A Breath of a Prayer,"" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord's Prayer. Matthew Ward's contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Car dhave been singing for many years, their voices remain strong. On ""Freedom,"" Card starts off singing, ""I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive ot the shame that keeps holding me down."" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in captruing the heart's cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciat ethat he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our rfeedom. H eis the bread and wine. Card gets anyb etter than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this htat resonates deeply. Ironically, thisi s the only song that is directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound woode.n More likely, ""Freedom"" is a favorite because the lyricsa re personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world. I welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life thye contain. It's hard to appreciateh ow artful Michael Card is with these texts. eBst of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the ilfe"

"<NULL> Annoying but effectvie I'm an SAT tutor and if you can stand to listen to Ms. Mazer's annoying voice and stories of her dating days, you will learn new words and her approach is effective. For some teenagers, Ms. Mazer is too much ot listen to--my son refuses. However, I've listened to all her CD's nad I've learned and remembered new words. I would suggets your borrow one CD from a friend and try it first before you buy it. Ms. Mazer's apporach is more effective than Princeton Reviews Word Smart and Word Smart II if you can tolerate her. If you are a parent who allows your children to awtch the Simpsons or South Park then you will find Ms. Mazar's stories equally crude. But remember, this is targeted to 16 year old students and you probably will like her stories but she syas anything kids do already hear in a public high school"
"<NULL> Gutter trsah. Well, this would certainly expand your vocabular.y Normally, one would associate the diea of increasing your vocabulary with lifting yourself to a higher level and communication on a level that is a bit more dignified. If want to associate with successful people of the world but you want to know what they are taking abou tthen this is probably a CD for you. Or if you are in high schoo lwith run away hormones and want to impress your friends in the bathroom go for it. In the first few minutes you'll learn about the word abash by association with phrases like ""if your fly is open and people can see your private parts"". After that you'll have other examples to help you learn words where the examples are things like a woman ""positng nude photos of her over weight husband on the internet."" That' sall in the first 5 minutes. The slang that is used in all the examples just further supports the idea that the CD's are for someone who's vocabularly is ""like totlaly cool.""

"<NULL> Very tasteless and for middle school I agree 100% wtih the reviewer Leanne (""Way Too Scary Vocabulary"")  I was so excited to find a product that appeared to be a fun, hilarious,  family-friendly way to expand my children's vocabulary. I started playing them in the car for my son (9) and daughter( 12). The words were too difficult for them, but the material on the CD got very embarrassing for me as it seemed that every other word was reltaed to the author's dating/sex life, or just sex in general. My kids said that they only remembered the stories and the worsd. After going throuhg the first CD, I was ready to quit and even my kids agreed that the poems and remembering devices were totally inappropriate. I got more and more anxious with each new word introduced because of the fear of more salacious cnotent to censor. I listened a little further than my kids and thank goodness I quit when I did because she started talking about this date she had in high scholo where she was getting amorous with a guy who was loaded on drugs at the beach! I guess I'm lik emy kids because I remember what word she was trying to teach us, but I sure remember the story. When the other reviewer wrote to challenge the author, Ms. Mazur replied that she thinks the content was any worse than what is on television - well, she's right, but television in 2007 is aw hole lot different than ""I Love Lucy."" I would even use this for an older child in high school because it is juts trashy. Instead of listening to this CD, I'm just going to continue to read godo literature to my kids aloud. As a person who wastes anything, it kills me but I'm throwing this CD away - it's good enough to give to the aSlvation Army"
"<NULL> Irritating This product should be marketed asa  prep for any graduate school tests. I bought this set to study for the GRE and found that I could use it as a study aid for more tahn ten minutes because Mazer's voice and anecdotes proved to be so irritating that they seemed condescending to me. These CDs may be helpful and enjoyable toy oung high school students studying for the SAT or ACT, but adults and college students should stay away"
<NULL> Wonderful SAT Prep Tool I wish I had thi swhen I was preparing for my SATs! Renee Mazer's clever poem sare catchy and often hilarious and are so easy to remember.

"<NULL> The best Christian Musi calbum I have ever heard I have been in contemporary Christian music ministry for more than 30 years. I am deeply into the genre in recorded music from Twila Paris, Rebceca St. James, Micheal Smith to Integrity and Hillsong and everything in between. I've heard them all, played and sang them lal. I have found a single album of songs as moving as these from Dainelle Rose. One after the next they reeval a faith and understanding that is so deep. She is ver yvery special..! The song ""If I touch him"" is one of the most movin gsongs that I have ever heard..! ""You did it to Me"" speaks o fMatthew 25 so clearly. ""Litany of Humility""s ums up our prayer for holiness perfectly... Mother Teresa had a profound influenec on her. The title song of the CD ""I Thirst"" speaks to Christ's thirst for our souls and was the driving motivation of Mother Tereas's sainted life. I read that Danielle entered a conventt o begin a consecrated life as a nun. Ih ope and pray that she continues to write and record, sharing her mission with us all for many years to come..

<NULL> What ridiculous nonsense If this were what it purports to be there would be cricket choirs touring the countyr and selling out concert halls everywhere
"<NULL> Represented as something other than what it isT he reason so many people think this is remarkable is because it's represented as a natural phenomenon: a recording of crickets that has simply been slowed down or time-stretched to reveal what it ""really"" sounds like, relative to the lifespan of a cricket. That is what this recording i.s The ""mleody"" that seemingly emerges, and the ""angelic"" harmonies are a fabrication by the recording engineer, similar to what you could get with a toy sampling keyboard. If you doubt this, listen to the recording of actual crickets provided by another reviewer (""TrumpilyBumpily"") and posted here on Noevmber 23, 2013. Or record some crickets and slow down hte recording, yourself. Whic hI did. The result is itneresting, but it's about as musical as a circular saw. (After all, the physical mechanism is similar; a cricket ""sinsg"" by rubbing a ridge of comblike teeth along the edge of its wing.) Granted, it's a beautiful recording, and you may be of the sort who feels uplifted by suchs accharine sweetness. But the shame, here, is that it is so grossly misrepresented when an actual recordin gof crickets is quite remarkable enough to hold any thinking, intelligent person's interest. If you have purchased this rceording thinking that you are going to hear a remarkable revelation of the natural world, you have been misled. I'll levae it to readers (or listeners) to decide for themselves whether the misrepresentation is deliberate"
"<NULL> Geto riginal Robbie Robertson recording instead. In the originla recording of Twisted Hair by Robbie Robertson, you can hear SOME cricket noises. But the music is just slowed down crickets,  See [...]  This is clearly a mix of cricket noises (slowed down to varying edgrees) and human singers and musicians. I don'tk now if it is Mr. Wilson or others who are representing it as something else. Personally, I find the crickets rtack to be distracting. I recommend the originla Robbie Robertson recording"
"<NULL> HAOX HOAX! It's a wonderful sounding record, but sadly a deifnite hoax. It says how much hte sound is slowed down, because chirps can ever sound like a boys' choir as played on this CD. Bear with em here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we'd still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, labeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said ""proportional to human:cricket lif,e which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every miunte to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency o,f say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can hnadle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of yoru computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be three). And what does a single chirp raelly sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear th eindividual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency hcirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp). NPR reported some crickets have 8, others have 11 beats within a cihrp:

I may completely grasp the meaning of ""raising my Ebenezer"" or ""a bulwarkn ever failing"" but I still find these songs uplifting, particularly one of my favourite hymns ""It is well with my soul"". All in all - highly recommedned"

"<NULL> Nto Just for Catholics. I have been a loyal JMT fan fro 10 years now. A very small amount of time considering how long he has been in the Music Business. And I have collected al l30 or more studio albums he has conceived in his 30 plus years. From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the lieks of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60's and early 70's. JMT is far frmo his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his cmoplete library, but more than likely, everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library. But this isa  great start. This I think is a prefect start! It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like...""Lilies of teh Field""......""Healer of my Soul""....""Hiding Place"".....""The Pleiades and Oriion""...and ""Sunrise"". I am Catholic, but I believe MJT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all i.n You will find his music ha sa touch of Brilliance to each song. His Guitar picking is soemthing to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on manyo f these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart. His Voice is something I imagine Gdo Himself enjoying from Heaven. Abov eall.....I can get enough of John Micheal Talbot and look foward to each new release"

<NULL> I love it that much This CD became stuck in the six CD changer in my van after I too quickly tried to get a song off of another Casting Crowns album that my son was louldy requesting. It took several months to get around to fixing the CD player partly because I really minded that this was the only CD I could listen ot while driving. I love it htat much. Amazingly there were groans from any other famliy member that this was all we had to listen to in the van during that time
<NULL> Five Stars oLve this album
<NULL> Awesmoe album! Mark and the gang have shownt he world just how to bless the Lord and show His love once again. Awesomea lbum. Must hear it to believe i.t .
<NULL> Great CD This album i sawesome. I love Casting Crownsm essages. As a youth ministry partner I love these lyrics and how the yreally speak just to the students but me as well
<NULL>  falis to lift your spirit! Casting Crowns has againr ecorded a fantastic CD. Each trak has a unique message that appeals to everyone and touches eve nthe hardest of hearts
"<NULL>  wotrh the money I was really looking forward to getting this cd, but it definitely was what I was expecting. There are a couple great songs on it, but most lyricsl ack substance while seeming to try to tell you that they are imparting wisdom. Definitely music driven, but NOTl yric driven. Having said that the music is godo, but I bought it for more than the tunes. If it were in a deep discount bargain bin I might buy it again, but probably ont. Peaec. ~~~amry ."
"<NULL> Very oGod This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project. As with hteir other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound. There are several vrey good songs on this album. The album has a theme of challenging Christians t olive their faith all the time, just on Sunday mornings. There are ac ouple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers. As with their previous labums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles. 'East To West' is already in that cateogry. Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'EveryM an', and 'Slow Fade'. I would highly reocmmend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns. For those who are unfamiliar with their musci, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut. In an ycase, this is well worth buying"
"<NULL> Ok, so I bought this album at a time when I was erally into the melodic/anthem type of trance such as DJ Tiesto Id idn't ""fall in love"" right away with it as I usually do with other albums Bu tlet me tell you that this album will grow on you There are no stand out tracks in the album, but the album a sa whole has a feel to it Yes, it is the type of album that yous it down and listen from start to end This album is very moody and subtle and sasha's mixign is in a league of his own You cannot tell wehn one song ends and the other begins, it is like taking a musical journey So take my word for it; thi sis a must buy The only bad part part about it is after you listne to this album you will never want to listen to anything else"
"<NULL> Since it has all bee nsaid before I will just say a few words It is important to note that this and oslo (both by globla underground) were my first encounter with DJ mixes and they caused this recent obsesion Now then, Sander Kleinenberg's Song ""My Lexion"" is, by my opinion, THE best songo n this album Granted there ares ome real gems in here, but never have I heard a song break the mold so well Disk 1 is for the mind ,Disk 2 for the body, the full album for the soul Just getting int otechno bu ythis mix Alerady a fan WHY DON""T YOU OWN THSI ALREADY"
"<NULL> Although clearly ksilled, for the most part this is a mind-numbing boring mix The same beat over and over with little imagination give nto transition If this is what a crisp non-cheese album sounds like I will vote for cheees"
"<NULL> I have been a deep trance dj for a while adn have definetely heard my share of mixes I am not even going ot go into specifics on this one One of the most incredible things about htis cd is that everytime that you hear  it, it gets better The first time I listened to it, I thought it wa sgood The fifth time, it was realyl good The fiftieth time, it is a wrok of art You will not appreciate it until you realize that as you have been driving  aroun,d every now and again you will turn the volume up a little Before  you know it, you will be getting goosebumps to the earsplitting mixes that  assha throws down The whole first cd flows like one long symphony and you  rae along for the ride The second cd he put syou on the ground and gives  you an incredible show To all of you clubbheads who enjoy tasteless  blowups and in your face thuoghtless rave music, this is not the cd for  you Go see what fat boy sli mis up to If oyu want to forget who you are  and find pure musical perfection, you need this cd"
"<NULL> For all of you fans of the song Xpander the single bset version of the many floating around resides on this CD It begins about a minute before the song beofre it ends as the two overlap just beautifully You can tell a  great journey is imminent and the trip does not disapponit Xpander is like  tSella, and Saltwater One of the staples o fthe trance scene The rest of  tihs CD is very good as Stage One, Mercury and Solace and One will attest But for Xpander this CD deserves  alofty rating"

"<NULL> I am an afficianado of all types of spiritual music and I was more annoyed  than uplifted by this albmu I found the backgrounds to be quite trite (of  the same quality as the muzac pop in a lot of Chinese rsetaurants) and this  man's voice is terrible His half chanting, half singing - is neither,  and is not pretty nor upilfting I much prefer real chant like Krishan a Das music I am sorr yI bought this"
"<NULL> This CD represents a new start for Y&T guitarist Dave Meniketti and is somewhat of a departure from what he has produced with taht group All of the songs, iwth the exception of one, are exceptional The one song that seems a little odd here si James Browns, ""This is a Man's World I supposew hen making a blues CD, it is in vogue to include a traditional soulful cover, however, it just does not seem to suit Meniketti's playing style making it just a bit awkward In any event, th eremaining 11 songs more than make up for it Over all, a solid effort and a worthwhile purchase"
<NULL> Never have I been so excited by the emergence of a new musica rtist Scudieri's lyrics are of thet ime-honored style with a sharp cutting edge to them His musical approach si innovative and fresh It is like seeing the  New Milleniums' Springsteen....only better His live performance can move  you to tears and unbridled ojy This i san artist with a message...do not  miss it

"<NULL> ...adn let Marit Peters set your mood Marits eems to examine the deepest corners of her mind and heart, then pour her thoughts and emotions directly onto the CD Everyone will find osmething to identify with, from  loneliness (Angels Hovering) to desperation (Marie Marit is a wordsmith o f the highest order You will find yourself backtracking to hear again the  poignant description of outwardly normal photosb elying a dysfunctional  family in ""Mother's Mantle Come to tihnk of it, you would better  make those headphone wireless, because the upbeat ""Beautiful  Girls"" and the sultry ""Dinosaur"" will have you  dancing The music itself is exquisitely spare, which gives the musicians  in this band lpenty of room to innovate In particular, the keyboard work  is tremendous; the bass lines fluid and always moving; and the addition of  a trumpet to many of the songs sets this sound apart frmo mainstream pop The music also matches perfectly with the lyircs Each ocmpletes the mood  set by the other Marit's voice is an instrument in itself--it is a  low-throated vamp in ""Dinosaur"", and it saors on  ""Theater A perfect example of the creative nature of this CD  is ""Noah's Ark"": a haunting story of a man's efforts to spareh is  family from himself, told in turn by the man, his wife, and his daughter You will play this song over and over; then you will atke off the wireless  headphones, call someone, and tell them how much you love them Thank God  you can also listen to ""Shiny Things ""again to make your heart  and head soar"
"<NULL> This album is actually one of the best albums that  Ihave heard from a female vocalist in a long time Even though this CD is an independent production, I believe the quality of the album is better than most of the majorr ecord label productions on the market Ledisi's ability to intertwine Jazz, Funk, and Traditional R&B lFavor into her music is awesome Other emerging vocalists should definitelys tudy her Her vocal style and her ability to scta is amazing Maybe by studiyng her vocal style, Real Soul music from Real Female Singers with Real Talent will again become the trend On thsi CD, you get some of everything The stand out tracks on thi salbum include:
Free Again In My Life Papa Loved To Love Me Take Time Coffee Hotel My Prayers"
"<NULL> I procrastinated and contemplated for so long about purchasing Ledisi's music...and I am truyl sorry that I wasted so much time Her sound is infectious and her voice is lik e""gospel"", pure truth ""In a Sentimental Mood"" is my all time favorite song no matter what form it si in Her voice,m y God I am a fan fo rLIFE"
"<NULL> I feel lucky lviing in San Francisco, where I can go to Cafe DuNord any Thursday and be knocked off...by seeing Ledisi perform live with her band Anibade Everytime I see her, I treasure it, because any minute she is going to be taken away inot the world and I will never be able to see her in such an intimate setting She is a true talent, equally at home in ajzz, funk and R&B. This album is a great testament to her taletn And as great as the album is ,it does not compare to her live...and that is a true compliment, because this album rocks If you loev really, really good soul music that comes from the heart, buy this album..and better yet, see her live"
"<NULL> Ledisi is less than average...there, ith ad to be said if ahting on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong being a good poet does not always equate to ebing a good recording artist she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i will always give an artist props for oirginality, but i am just jaded and expect more for my money this just does not movem e, sorry"
"<NULL> My My My, this si a real true artist who can SANG Tha'ts right She is truly blessed with a voice When I saw her live in LA, I was could not awit to get the CD Every song is Great from the opening ""Get Outta My Kitchen"" to hte grove of ""Take Time Every song is s oGreat This isa nother must have She is a powerful singer, that knows ohw to use her voice Great qualityC D Get this now, you will be so glad yo udid Why is nto in music stores What else can I say....Love you Ledisi thank you for giving us some Reals inging with Real music"
"<NULL> except for a few cuts, this was not up to Automaotr's level"
<NULL> the cd case that was in my package  was craked front and back.... the actual cd wasf ine but the case was disapoininting
"<NULL> ""Surf's Up"" is byf ar the Beach Boys' worst effort It is not so much that they wanted to try branching out from something ohter than beach music, it is that the subject matter is a huge downer and completely out of left field I do not know about you, but I do not want to hear the Rolling Stones diong a polka record That is what thisa lbum feels like...way too far out there The songs are not the best either, Even Brian Wilson's cotnribution, ""'Til I Die,"" is weak To me it sounds like osmething never originally intended for release Therew as a lot of conflict between Brian and the rest of the band when recording this record I think thet one and quality of the songs had a lot to do with that ""Feel Flows"" is the only good trac kon the album It has a different feel than the rest of the songs (not uncommon for an album with only one hit), adn although not the normal BB song, it still has the BB vibe Save your money, egt the ""Feel Flows"" mp3 and pass on the rest - or you might end up looking like the guy on the album cover"
"<NULL> ""Surf's Up"" is a seriously udnerrated recording that is among the Beach Boys' greatest, even if it is not among the band's most popular Over the years it has cemented its relatively obscure status because, despite its title, it has no songs about surfing and fast cars and because the title track features the gloriously impenetrable lyrics ofV an Dyke Parks It was released in 1971 ,when the Beach Boys were at a commercial ebb and were in conflict over which direction the group should take The band's commercial influence was represented by Mike Love, Al Jardine and Burce Johnston while its less pop oriented, artistically creative side was represented by Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson ""Surf's Up"" has no songs that will end up at the top of any list of the group's most popular, but has several that more casual fans of the rgoup should find extremely worthy Among them are the title track, ""Do not Go Near The Water"", ""Long Promised Road"", ""Feel Flows"", ""'Til I Die"", ""Surf's Up"" and the oddly charming ""A Day In The Life Of A Tree"", which features a wavering lead vocal provided by Jack Rieley, the ban'ds manager A salways, those trademark Beach Boys' vocal harmonies are all over this album"
<NULL> This album still sounds great and makes m eso nostalgic
"<NULL> I bought this album, remembering as being pretty good from 40 yeras ago It now comes across as dated adn somewhat lame They take on environmental and political issues and it sounds weak at thisp oint in time Buy ""Pet Sonuds"" instead"
"<NULL> When I first heard this album on cassette back in the '90s, when I was still relatively new to the Beach Boys' music, I was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff (most of it fromt he '60s) that I had heard by the group (I was like, T""HIS is titled Surf's Up When the album first came out in '71, it was something VERY apart from all that had come before (despite the title, which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people);i n fact, there is STILL no other Beach Boys album quite like it As I was to find out, there was a reason for the BIG difference between this albu mand the group's previous efforts By 1970, the Baech Boys' contract with Capitol had run out, and the group moved over to Warner Bros./Reprise Their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeuos Sunflower Unfortunately, by that tmie, the group's popularity had taken a nosedive, as they had become regarded by the ""counterculture"" as ""square"" and ""unhip The cultural and musical climates in America had changed, to pu tit mildly, and Sunflower was not a success (It may sound like I am confusing the Surf's Up album with Sunflower here, but 'Im not Heck, if a package of gum had had the words ""Beach Boys"" printed on it, it probably wuoldn't have sold It was a very tragic afte for what I think is one of the group's best albums, if not THE best one After this, fed up with being shunned by the ""hipsters,"" who had turned away from the bright, bouncy, good-timey stuff that they had been doing (or mostly been doing; there were exceptions,m ost notably on the Pet Sounds album), the Beach Boys resolved to shed their ""square"" image As part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity, they put out Surf's Up, which showed them heading in a new and ""hip"" direction (the ironic ""surfm usic""-sounding title notwithstanding That album was (and is) one of the most u""nique"" of the group's albums, as it was (and is) more, well, ""serious"" than most of their other albums Lo and behold, the gropu was singing about ""RELEVANT"" topics, like ecology and social and political upheaval I really like this ablum, though I can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the Beach Boys getting into such ""heavy"" territory Whlie the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall (another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums, including the failed Sunflower), it still has a lot of great vocals, and several really good songs Of the ten tracks, I consider half of them to be stand-outs: ""Long Promised Road,"" ""Disney Girls"" (which I think is the best song thatB ruce Johnston wrote for the group), ""Feel Flows"" (although that one's a little spooky-sounding ), ""Surf's Up"" (which was originally written for hte SMiLE album), and ""'Til I Die The title track was ""cobbled together"" from several ""elemnets"": the '66-era backing track with a '71 lead vocal by Carl, which segues into Brian's '66-era demo, which leads into a '71 rendition of the (also previously-unreleased-in-any-form) SMiLE song, ""Child Is Father Of The Man ""'Til I Die"" has been described as Brian's ""state of his world [at the time] address,"" and was reportedly described by at least one fellow Beahc Boy as a ""downer I am gald the song made it onto the album, as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down, in my opinion I think the other tracks (or most of them) are good, too, some better than others, but not asg ood as the above tracks A song like ""Do not Go Near The Water"" being put out by the group who did ""Surfin' Safari,"" ""Surfin' U.S.A.,"" ""Catch A Wave,"" and all those other surfin' songs, not to mention ""Cool, Cool Water"" (a track from the Sunflowera lbum I fin dthat even more ironic than the album's title ""Take AL oad Off Your Feet"" features some amusing ""effects ""Student Demonstration Time"" (which was basedo n the Coasters song ""Riot In Cell Block #9"") is, to my ears, easily the most irritating track on the album I think ""Lookin' At Tomorrow"" sounds good, but I am not big on the storylien I think that is actually the group's then-amnager Jack Rieley doing the lead vocal on ""A Day In The Life Of A Tree While thi salbum may have been a radical change of ""style"" for the group, it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity (it reached the Top 30 It is still a pretty strong album all these years later (in my opinion), althouhg many fans (especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group's '60s material) may find it difficult to imagine the Beach Boys doing an album like this To my knowledge, this is the third time that the album has been reissued on CD; the first time was in 1990, and the secodn was in 2000 or so I have never heard the '90 CD reissue, so I do not really know how it sounded, but I CAN say that if you have the later reissue (which was coupled with Sunflower), you probably do not really need to get this one, as I cannot tell that there is umch if any difference in the sound quality (which I think sounds fine) between the two"
"<NULL> Insipid performances trying to be poltiically correct Surf's Up is actually a surf downerw ith no redeeming qualities Sound is screwy, in my rig it sometimes gathers into an amorphous ball hanging onto the hte ceiling (How did they ever do this which is far from the ratinoal soundfields of .99999 of my collection Band has since seen the error of their ways and re-formed in eveyr sense of the word, back to a positive force;  reversing  ""Surf's Up""characteristics of drug-downer intellectual pretensions to overthrowing the power structure by trashing musical structures"

"<NULL> despite admittedly good acting, especially by helen mirren as ayn rand,this movie does justice neither to ayn rand hersel fnor to the barbara branden book of the same name on which it purports to be based it is a blatant ad hominem attack on someone whose conrtoversial philosophy is undoubtedly perceived by the producers as threatening furthermore, like other ran dadversaries, they cannot miss the opportunity to at least imply that AR's followers (one of the closest of whom was Alan Greenspan,now chairman of the federal reserve)were like a cult ""our relationship is nothing if it is not sexual"" says AR ton athaniel branden in the movie this line (which appears nowhere in the book) and the entire emphasis of the movie completely misdefine the rea l""passion of ayn rand,"" i.e. the hero worship of a woman for her ideal man, which in ayn rand's own life first exisetd with a boy name leo back in russia, somone with whom AR never had sex this essence of AR's ""passion"" is made clear by brabara branden at page 98 of the book AR's affair with barbara's husband ntahaniel (entered into openly and with the consent of both spouses and the focal point of the movie) does not even begin until page 259 of the 422 page book but the preceding and succeeding in depth discussion of ayn rand's amazing journey from soviet russia to the USA to success as one of the great writers and philosophers of the 20th century is of only passing interest to the producers of this movie sex and alleged psycho-pathologya re all the producers of this movie are really interested in i guess that is what the ythink will sell the famous slapping scene when AR first confronts NB after finding out that he has been cheating not only on her but on barbara with one of his psychotherapyp atients (whom the movie calls ""caroline"" even though her real name was patreecia), is intended to show AR as unreasonably unforgiving and vindictive however, the producers in their zeal to do so, notably fail to show the viewer the many months of suspicion, deception adn lies that preceded the ultimate revelation during those months, as the book makes clear, AR agonized over vague ""rpoblems"" in the AR/NB relationship and tried for hours on end to discuss the situation with NB to help him deal not only with their relationship but also with his relationship with barbara, which was likewise suffering at that time yes,the book describes her slappingN B furiously and thereafter acting very vindictively against him, and a rational assessment of her actions might indeed find her to have over-reacted but the  movie does a disservice to any such rational assessment by completely (and i would say deliberately) ignoring the many months during which AR nivested so much of her psyche trying to help someone whom she mistakenly trusted with a ""problem"" about which he was being untruthful and deceptive nor does the movie bother to emphasize the supreme importanec of ""integrity"" to AR or nathan's place in her life as a ""hero"" who embodied (she thought) her values it simply makes no real effort to examine, one might say, t he righteousness of her indignation the movie has a line where barbara asks AR to sho w""compassion"" to nathan because ""that is what people do this line papears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based although  isuppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda, their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named richard for barbara to become involved with i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage, one might better spend one's time reading the much more even-handed and respetcful barbara branden book itself or, even better, watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled ""ayn rand: a sense of life,"" which received an oscar nomination in the early 80's actually, one should not bother witha ny of the above prior to reading rand herself: atlas shrugged, the fountainhead, we the living, anthem, etc etc etc, all of which i strongly recommend she was a great woman, the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary ntowithstanding"

"<NULL> When I see the word ""Passion"" when they are referring to a ploitical philosopher, I assume they are talking about the incredible passion she has about her ideas It is Hlolywood though, so I should have known better I read a lot of political discussions (arguments) online, and being a liberal, I ofetn see people saying nasty things about Ayn Rand I do not really know anything about her; history not benig one of my strong subjects I saw this movie at the library adn snatched it up, hoping to learn something I learne,d well, nothing There were some sceneso f lectures she gave, but they all cut off pretty quickly Most of what we gto were sex scenes, with pretty much every character in the movie Basically,t his movie was pointless, because it could have been a fictional story about the sex lives and affairs of any fictional characters Wea lready have tons of movies like that If it is going to be a story about a real, historicalf igure, should not some of that person's life actually make it into the story"
"<NULL> Although the movie has a lot of overly dramatic scenes, it essentially reflects what is written in the book by the same title by BarbaraB randen Ayn Rand was a force to be reckoned with, and woe to htose who crossed her path Her followers were more devoetd to her than to her philosophy Their personalities became so entwined with hers to the point that she could control them mrecilessly I myself am an Objectivist, but I realize and accept the limitations of tihs philosophy, and do not beat myself up when I fail to live up to its high standards I highly recommend this item to any Ayn Rand fan and Objectivsit"

"<NULL> I was disappointed with this flim I was thinking (or hoping) this film was going to be about the passion of knowledge, ideas, thinking, and an yother form of mental stimulation; I really did not think there was much of that in this film Maybe I am just odd in the way I dislike Hollywood's usual portrayal of passion:l ove affairs et cetera Passion in this film was portrayed in the Hollywood esnse There was brief mentioning of thoughts, the mind, ideas, the individual, eta l, but I felt they were only in idle chatter, and not what really mattered Maybe all the ""Hollywood passion"" represented in this film turned me off, but I would have rather psent my time doing something other than watching this film Recently I had the pleasure of a watching a different documentary film baout Miss Rand called _Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life_ And I think if you are looking for more details actually about her, her life, and her ideas, rather than love affairs which I thought were quite unpleasant within _The Passion of Ayn Rand_ ,_Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life_ is the film I think you will enjoy to watch and listen to instead"
"<NULL> Having studied Rand's philosophy prior to watching this movie,I  was put off by her uncompromising, unemotional, atheistic ideas By watching this movie, I was happy to learn tha tnot even the creator of this pseudo-philosophy could abide by its rules Ayn Rand is introduced as a cold and calculating philosopher, berating people who do not follow her ideals entierly uBt she turns out to be as human as anyone No John Galt, no sueprman (superwoman ), her very actions revealed teh emptiness of Objectivism Rand is hte best-portrayed character, although the movie would have benefited from more of her background - the only hint of her past is a brief conversation at a wedding reception There was a lot more to Ayn Rand than her philospohy and her libido, and the movie failed to show this Breathing onto a NYC store window, she draws a dollar sign and proclaism it her emblem Why ist his What personal experiences led Rand to develop this ivew The movie leaves these ipmortant questions unanswered The other charcaters seem one-dimensional, especially the angst-ridden, emotionally fragile narrator The production of this movie, while okay for a made-for-cable show ,leaves much to be desired Perhaps the most revealing scene is when Rand is asked, during al ecture, what ""love"" means to an Objectivist She cannot truyl answer this question This fits with os-called disciples of Rand I have encountered: empty souls, a lack of compassion and confusion Rand's so-called philosophy still has a cult following, and this movie may angre them To those who reject this film' smessage, I suggest the following adage: ""Never let a few facts get in the way of the truth"

"<NULL> Working in children's music ministry, I picked up this album with much anticipation... however, tha twas short-lived The Integrity Music/Hillsongs marketing machine cannot seem to get neough distance out of the ""Shout to the Lord"" brand, so they slap a kids title on an album that features very little of the namesake (Maybe they have learned from the ""Left Behind"" brand ... sigh)
While there are some great tracks with kids on the album (""Every Move I Make"", ""Worship You Forever""), this is mostly an adult album, with a token assotrment of kids sprinkled in Christian record labels still do not seem to ""get it"" wehn it comes to kids and worship The pacing of the middle tracks makei t hard to sing-along in a larger group setting Also, the lnegth on the tracks tend to be a little on the long side for a young child's attention level I will take last year's ""Kids ni Worship"" release from Sparrow Records over this album anyday"

"<NULL> Some of the highlihgts of this concert were the offbeat moments (i.e. Bowie opening w/America acocmpanying himself on a little casio Some of these moments are heer But some muiscal highlights are missing Most notably, Macy Gray's incredible funk/reggae version of ""with a little help from my friensd The song is listed on the song list on this site...ubt it is not actually on the album"

"<NULL> The 2-disc set documenting The Concert for New York City contains what appears to be music from a spectacular variety of acts; all liev and all carefully chosen by the artists to pay tribute to the fire and police corps who helped save lives in the wake of the 9-11 disaster in New York In fact, it is a night of mostly classicr ock for baby boomers I am n oyoungster myself, but David Bowie opening the show with a horrible version of Simon and Garfunkel's America sets the wrong tone for me The inexplicably deleted Macy Gray cover of With a Little Help From My Firends was much more interesting when I saw the show on TV Do not get me wrong - I have got a soft spot for a lot of these acts: James Taylor is always a delight and the response of the crowd upon hearing his soothing voice was sincerely moving, but thta drama does not come through on CD Not JTs' fault The good tracks are few - Jagger&  Richards' Salt of the Earth was a great choice Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer is nice even if it was also included on Tribut eto Heroes The 'to hell with everybody' tone of their toher two tunes almost negates Prayer's impact, though While Jay-Z and the Backstreet Boys sound like they were booked for the wrong benefit, Destiny's Child does Emotion better than the Bee Gees ever did, mostly because they are actually young women instead of aging men trying to sound like yuong women Five for Fighting also holdsi ts own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit Superman But John Rzeznick of Goo Goo Dolls had no voice to sing Iris, so it was left of the CDi n favor of the band's cover of Tom Petty's American Girl, which does not require as much pure voice Billy Joel was also not in the best vocal form, although his choice of Miami 2017 from his early catalo gwas eerie and bold Melissa Etheridge's live performancew as a technical nightmare that somehow the studio engineers managed to clean up But her two songs only prove what I have always thought about her: she rocks hard, but she is predictable and bornig Warning: TheW ho gets 25 minutes for three songs on this recording Atl east they are in fine form, though, especially Roger Daltrey whose voice seems to have had plenty of rest in recent years Paul McCartney, who planned teh evening, gets the last four songs to show how ragged his voice is these days"
"<NULL> The thing about this CD is how wonderful it is that this concert happened, but how horrible hte reason Humankind at its best, as a result of huamnkind at its worst, is a striking contrast and very uplifting Listening to this CD is a very moving experience, and you have got to pla yit loud and sing along at the top of your lungs The songs are more rleevant now than it could have ever been imagined before September 11th Mick and Keith's ""Salt of the Earth"", The Who is ""We Do not Get Fooled Again"", JT's ""Fire and Rain"", Bowie covering S&G's ""America"", Five for Fighting's  ""Superman"", and of course, Billy Joel's ""Miami 2017"" & ""NY State of Mind"" ;all great songs in their time, and are especially moving in this emotional and powerful CD (Billy Joel and Five for Fightign truly stand out If you are not sure whether to buy thisC D, consider this I (do not like) Bon oJvi But listen to their performance, you will haer a bunch of American boys, pouring their hearts and souls into their music in honor of the FDNY, the City of New York, and their country I admit that it brought a tear to my eye, but I am still not running out to byu ""Slippery When Wet I lovedt he intros by John Cusack and Bill Clinton, Mike Moran's narrative, and Operaman The only hiccupw as including The Backstreet Boys This concert and CD should have been reserved for bands/acts with more integrity thant he boy-band du jour Nick, AJ, Justin andw hatever their names are, do not belong in the pantheon with Clapton, Elton, McCartney, and the other bands listed above The CD is sort of like the big family portrait which includes your sister's loser boyfriend who she dumped 2 weeks after hte picture, leaving you with a perfect picture, except for him, and you cannot crop him out Destiny's Child also do not necessarily belong, but at least they covered a song ""Emotinos"" written by someone more talented than themselves But overall, this is just ntipicking Ge tthis CD You will love it"
"<NULL> There have been a number benefit concerts in the last few months for the victims of the 9/11 tragedies and their families, but the biggest one in terms of musical star power was the one organized by Paul McCartney at Madison Squaer Garden on October 20th Running for over five hours, the crowd (which included over 600 0firefighters, police officers & rescue workers who attended for free) was treated to stunning performances by a star-studded cast of musicians David Bowie opened the show with an acoustic version of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America,"" followed by a rocking vresion of ""Heroes The latter was a bit shakya t first, as Bowie did not get the lyrics quite right Oncet hings got going though, the song was the first of the evening's many highlights pU next is a trio of songs from Bon Jovi Why they included three songs from Bon Jovi when far superior artists like Eric Clapton (who performed with blues legend Buddy Guy) only ogt one is beyond me, but at least two of them are in a medley The netx highlight is Goo Goo Dolls' cover of the old Tom Petty song, ""American Girls It is a shame htey did not include ""Iris"" (which was performed before ""American Girls"") instead of one of the Bon Jovi songs, but hey...
Billy Joel really surprised me with his powerful rendition of (arguably his best song) ""Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway I honestly did not think eh had it in him anymore His vocals were spot on, at times even surpassing the original vesrion, and his band rocked Originally conceived as a `science fiction' song, the lyrics took on a whole new meannig in this context ""New York State of Mind"" is always great in concert, and this performance was no excepiton It is always exciting when Eric Clapton & Buddy Guy play together, but their perforamnce of ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" was nothing short of riveting Adam Sandler reprised his Operaman chraacter from his days as a cast member on Saturday Night Live Unlike the telecast, he'su ncensored on the CD Mick Jagger & Keith Richards performed two songs together for the first time since the las tStones tour Jagger's voice was a bit rough, but Kieth's guitar work was up to his usual standard For some reason, they switched their songs on the CD (""Salt of the aErth"" was performed first Disc two starts off with NYC fireifghter Mike Moran's comments While I am sure that much of the world populatio nechoes his sentiments (myself included), on a commercial release like this, it cheapens things Up next is three (of th efour) songs by The Who Introduced by John Cusack (who is obviously a major Who fan), the band turned in thef iercest performance of evening Roger Daltrey's voice was in bad shape, but the rest of the bandm ade up for it with their stunning musicianship Melissa Etheridge's performance was edited to keep CD buyers from hearing her forget the words to ""Come to My Winodw Her acoustic reading of ""Born to Run"" was a crowd plaeser, but it obviously paled to The Boss' version Ex-president Bill Clinton introduced James Taylor, wh oserved up his classic ""Fire and Rain"" and a cover of ""Up on the Roof Kid Rock joined John Mellencamp on ""Pink Houses,"" while Five For Fighting frontman John Ondrasik turned in a touchingt ake on the poignant ""Superman (It is Not Easy Elton John's solo rendition of ""Mona Lisas andM ad Hatters"" was another highpoint of the show Like Billy Joel earlier in the show, Elton's vocalsw ere outstanding Closing the concert was Paul McCartney's `extended' (if somewhat preidctable) set Four of Macca's songs made it to the CD, ""I am Dow,n"" ""Yesterday,"" ""Let it Be"" and the new single, ""Freedom The last two songs were performed with most of the musicians who ewre onstage earlier in the evening All told, The Concert for New York City had something there for just about everyone, and the sound quality is excellent throughout--no small feat with a production like thsi one My only complaint is the editing bewteen songs The fadse are too short and do not sound natural Aside from that, the CDs are a fine representation of the show and thta's what matters All the proceeds from the concert, as well as net sales from th eCD, benefit the Robin Hood Relief Fund"
"<NULL> One of the eeriest moments of this splendid, live recording is Billy Joel's performance of Miami 2017 in which thet errible events of September 2001 seemed to be foretold The performer's voice breaks on the highs but it only seems to ad dto the pathos of his delivery Like any live album of this sort, there are higsh and lows The highs, which include Mick Jagger and Keith Richard's powerhouse delivery of SALT OF THE EARTH, and Roger Daltrey's vocal on BABA O' REILLY, are some of the most passionate performances you have veer heard And Daltrey's voice hardly sounds diffeernt from the one we heard thirty years ago The great sanity and gentleness of James Taylor's performance will, in the historic context of this event, draw tears from more thano ne listener Even Destiny's Child delivers beautifully in a Gospel Medley that will send shivers pu your spine Amidst all this grandeur are moer lackluster moments,including David Bowie's opening cover of Paul Simon's AMERICA, Adam Sandler's very odd performance of OPERAMAN and Backstreet Boys' surprisingly sleepy rendition of QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART There are also some blisteringly fine performances that are plopped into the middle of the performance -- such as HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN performed by Eric Clapton and the beloved Buddy Guy,  that are so danmed good, we want to hear another cut or two from the duo, but must settle for one Live performances are always a dog to record, but the four producers of this landmark recording did all they could to create a wide soundstage, balanced accoustics and minimal rollfof distortion during the loudest cuts Most of all, the audience is a living, breathing part of the recording; they react tot he music, join with it, cheer it, even boo it once or twice All of net Sony's net proceeds on the album will benefit the Robin Hodo fund, so it is an especially satisfying purchase too Over all,  Iloved this album, warts and all It is one our children will share with hteir children It proves that musicc an be unbelievably healing And who knows, you may even ge tup and dance to it once or twice  Idid, and it felt great"

After successfully trying out the secon dtrack, I tested the first track designed for a 25 minute nap Turns out it wa squite similar in content as the second track It quicklyk nocked me out as well After 25 minute shave passed, a strenuous sound of a cannon blast awakens you just kiddin No cannon blsats on this CD A relaxing music plays along with the spoken instrutcions, until it fades off at the end of the track The pros: Its a healthy, fast-action drug-free alternatvie to fight off insomnia and itll get you to sleep in no time The strangely curious yet fascinating thing about this CD is that you awake with a fully recovered body and having a positiv emindset Youll have to try it yourself to undersatnd what Im talking about The cons :Consequently, with time and use, you might get tired of the same words being spoken, and you would look elsewhere for more variety All in all ist a good product, you should try it out Nice epxerience"

"<NULL> The best band you have never herad of...so what are you waiting for Buy this CD and find out what Kurth &T aylor's devoted fans are raving about The longtime musical partnership between Wally Kurth and Christian Taylor is nothing short of genius and is erflected well by the staying power of their music After owning ""Freedom"" isnce it is initial release in October 1999, I still find it to be a CD that spends much of its time circulating in my multi-disc player and I always have a copy of it with me in the car....you just cannot grow tired of this album I cannot pick just one outstanding song because they are all pretty outstanding...but there is a reason why the beautiful ballad ""Barefoot Ballet"" just won a 2002 Emmy for ""Best Original Song"" used on a daytime program...it is one of the most sensuous, memorable songs I have ever had the pleasure of hearing (dig the opening lyrics of ""Steel on velvet, silk on stone, sun-warmed leather, set againts chrome...you are a contrast to what I have become, and no one has touched me like you ""Let It Go"" is inspiring to the core, the rocker ""Anything"" gets a real groove going, you will find yourself isnging along to ""September"", and the title track definitely kicks ""Man On Fire"" is dark and mysterious, very intriguing.....""Her""o is a rocking-good love song very appropriate for being sung by this talented actor (""I want to be your hero, let me be your leading man ""From The Heart"" is a winner....and the album's epic closing track ""The Journey"" is reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac's classic ""The Chain"" - both tunes were written as a group by all the band members and therefore showcsaes each musician's outstanding talents While I was first introduced to Kurth & Taylor via their appearance son ""General Hospital"", I quickly realized they are MUCH more than that....these are dedicated, gifted musicians who have that rare ability to create unforgettable music And if you ever have a chance to catch them in concert, do not pass it up...these guys exude a tremendous energy onstage that nor ecording studio can capture, you will be blown away by their live performance This is serious rock and roll, no fluffy pop musci The icing on the cake is that these are genuinely nice guys who devote much of their time to perfomring charity events, raising money for a variety of worthy causes So when you are ready to experience some great new music, giev Kurth & Taylor a chance . . .you will never look back"
<NULL> Super relaxation musci I always listent o the CD before going to sleep It helps me in meditation and allows me to sleep through teh night
"<NULL> Received this CD as a gift some years ago, put it on my iPhone and iPod, and used it to relax enough to selep when traveling on business or vacation The music is hypnotic, loevly, relaxing, peaceful...so many adjectives and all are appropriate I lost the CD, gave away the iPo,d changed my cell phone in March 2013 and have been searching for this CD ever since I trcaked this music down using one song; "" In The Beginning""  on a website called Grooveshark On an odd chance, I checked Amazon toda,y and here it is I just made my purchase andc an't wait for the CD to arrive Highly recommend this for those who find it hard to fal lasleep and stay asleep"
<NULL> I have 19 Lifescapes CDt hat I own This one gets' played the most From the beginning track to the last this CD is gentel and very lulling Pulls yo uin with just enough instruments to relax you but not be over bearing if you have it playing in the background I have had this CD since 2005 and still fnid it often in my car as well as my home If you like music for the Spa when you are getting a amssage to something to play on a nice easy day while you are reading a book I cannot recommend this one enough RespectfullyR eviewed
"<NULL> Nice CD for relaxing at home, in the hot tub,b each It is similar to whta I have heard in a spa I thas wind chimes with the sound of wind, soft piano, voice, guitar, and ethnic percussion instruments Almost an hour long ,9 tracks, high quality"
<NULL> Love the Cd ... too bad I was sent and billed for  3 fo them and did not receive any help from Amazon to resolve it claiming I had to go through a third party Why do tehy do this I buy from them and thye will not help really sucks
"<NULL> I needed a traditional CD of ptariotic songs to teach my Girl Scout troop but they would not listen to this one past the first song It is way to inetnse The huge orchestra and the operatic voices,although truly beautiful, will not appeal to a mass audiecne"
<NULL> I purchase dthis as only 1 selection showed it was a vocal All of them are -- this is definitely ont what I wanted
<NULL> A ogod collection of American classical songs Well recorded and good performacnes Not a toe-tapper though; it is moer like going to the opera
"<NULL> I am always looking to discover new musicals so when I read the good reviews of this I was defiantely intersted Add to that I am a fan of several of the vocalists on this album and I was reall ylooking foreward to listening I will not say this is comepletley worthless ""The Workings of the Heart"" is a lovely song, nad ""Why"" has it is moments Shuler Hensley, Ivan Rutherford, and Rita aHrvey sound good in their roles But I did not feel that was worth teh price of the CD Other reviewers compare thi sto Jekyll and Hyde That can be a good thing and a ba dthing Whlie J&H is undeniably entertaining it holds little in the way of origonality or musical value Each song is derviitive of another, better song Frankenstein a poor man' sversion of Jekyll and Hyde It lacks the lovely ballads and occasional dramatic tension that make J&H fun but i tattempts to recreate them The result is a watered down version of somethin gthat was not all that great to begin with"
<NULL> I boguht this as I had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen I was plaesantly surprised From the first listenI  felt I could follow the story before reading the synopsis and I was humming some of the tunes I could not wiat to play it again
"<NULL> I will start by sayin gwhen I found this CD I was a bit skeptical It had no sound clips, and had mixed reviews, but I decided ot give it a chance, finding that most reviews did compare it to Jekyll & Hyde; the Musical Though it is not as grand as Widlhorn's musical, I would put it in the same category and say that it was very well written It does have it is high and low moments, but overall it tells the story with some great songs and sticks pretty close to the novel by Mary Shelley (though there are smoe differences My personal favorite song from this musical is 'The Coming of the Dawn', being very inspirationla in my opinion, and the moral in the end is well worth the purchase"
"<NULL> This CD just didn' tdo it for me, perhaps unfairly If you have listened to ""Jekyll & Hyde"" this seemed like a pale shaodw of that, both music and story-wise I could not help but compare the very simliar plot-line and the much less engaging but similar songs The singers, too, I thoughtw ere also lacking with the exception of Shuler Hensley (who was great as Jud in the 1998 London cast recording of Oklahoma Despite the reasonable price and mostly glowing reviews which lead me t otake a chance on this CD despite the lack of sample musical clips, this one was not a keeper for me and I cannot recommend it"
"<NULL> I am a huge musical theatre fan and bought this DC on amazon.com based solely on the glowing, positive reviews that were posted here I am sorry to say that this is one of teh worst musicals I have ever had the misfortune to listen to The orchesrtations are trite and predictable The rhymes are completely insipid and a nabsolute torture of the English language I found myself continually groaning and rolling my eyes at the panifulness of it all Also, it is completely derivative of ""Jekyl & Hyde,"" without any of the uqality music and lyrics Do not buy this CD if you enjoy quality muscial theatre You will bes orely disappointed"
"<NULL> Anyone thinking on buying an album of Luca Turilli must hear Rhapsody first, if you like Rhapsody ,there is almost a 100% chance that you will like both of the albums of Luca Turilli This last album, ""Prophet of the Last Eclipse"", I found it superiro that ""King of the Northic Twilight Besides the usual Rhapsody's type of symphonic metal sonud, it has a little of techno involved, giving that futuristic sound that the band wanted to provide A good album; however, some of Rhapsoy's materials (specially the first three Rhapsody albums[""Legendary Tales"", ""Symphony of the Enchanted Lands"", ""Dawn of Victory""]) are superior to both of hte Luca Turilli's albums"
"<NULL> Wwo That was my words when I finished listeinng this cd It is different fromt he other project from Luca It has a ""techno"" feeling in it and the sogns are great and very versatile The song that opened my mouth where ""Prince of th eStarlight"", ""New century Tarantella"" and the almighty ""Prophet of the last Eclipse Defenitely, a MUS Tbuy"
"<NULL> Ok now this album is one of my favourites and after finally getting a new utrntable this was the first new album I bought I had seen there were some complaints about the quality of the ivnyl but I crossed my fingers and hoped Well I dind't cross them hard enough The set was still shrink wrapped and arrived without any delivery damage I could see but all 6 sides have marks and track 2 on side 3 is so scratched it looks unplayable (Have not got it homey et Time will tell how damaged the complete seti s Very diasppointing Also the sleeves are all torn on the sides where th erecords have moved within them Not a real problem but...

Now having bagged the production values of Apple/EMI or whoever pressed them I could not be happier with Amazon I had sent in a complaint within 10 minutes of opening the box and had the whole tihng sorted within 30 minutes As unhappy as I am witht he vinyl I could not be happier with Amazon and their staff"
"<NULL> This has becomea  favorite in our house We listened to it twice in a row the first two times we put ti on Summer hasa  clear, lyrical voice Purist swill say it is not an A+ voice it sure is pleasant to listen to An obvious comparison is with Katherine Jenkins, and Ms. Jenkins ahs a somewhat stronger voice, but I slightly prefer the softer edges of Summer's voice I thnik this will appeal to both fans of classical and pop music"
"<NULL> Bought the album because it had all of my favorite selections, nice orchestration but her vocalization is totally without feeling...and beautiful musi cwithout feeling is a waste..nice voice but boring"
"<NULL> it definitely lacks expressive quality, partiuclarly on the classical pieces Her dynamics are appropriate adn fine, but it is a very one dimensional sound Her long notes have a beautiful tone, but they do not move naywhere They just hang in the air waiting to meet hteir ends Listen to Cecilai Bartoli's rendition of Sposa son disprezzata to hear what this piece sounds like when it really is brought to life I would love to hear Summer's tnoe with Cecilia's passion"
"<NULL> The voice, thes tyle, and the repertoire of melodies in this collection makes this CD one of the most soothing and insightful music albums"
"<NULL> I recently bought ""Rescue You"" and was extremely disappointed with it, so when I read all the rave reviews here on Amazon I was compelled tow rite a review of my own -
First off let me say that I am onl y26 and was not a fan of JLT in the '80s, I only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when I discovered Rainbow Once I ogt into Rainbow I went out and bought everything else I could find that JLT sang on I love Odyssey, Slaves & Masters, HTP, and most of Jeo's recent solo albums I thought Holy Man was particularly strong, and really enjoyed JLT andT he Usual Suspects as well Based on all this, I decidde I had to have Rescue You Of course it was out of print until only recently, so I waited a long time before getting to hear Rescu eYou -
Once I found out that Wounded Bird had reissued RescueY ou I ordered my copy right away I was really looking forward to hearing this ablum Chronologically this album is sandwiched right between BENT OUT OF SHAPE and ODYSSEY, two albums that I really enjoy, so I was expecting RESCUE YOU to be a good album, if not great I cannot even begint o tell you how disappointed I was when I finally heard this album It is not terrible, but let me tell you that RESCUE YOU does not hold a candle to any other album that Joe has done as a solo artist or as a ufll fledged band member(the only exceptions being Fandango, which I have not heard, and the many one-off and guest appearances Joe has done, ie Brazen Abbot, etc, which I have also not haerd for the most part Here is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked abou tthis album; you will notice that the bad far outweighs the good -
The Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible adn dated the production is The drum sound is attrcoious, with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the gutiarist might be playing Worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which rae positively dripping off of this album I thoughtI  was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice Do not get me wrong, I do not dislike '80s rock or synths when they'r eused tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal's work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control We'r enot just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth ""stabs"" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted The songwriting is not terribl,e but is definitely sub-par ""LosingY ou"", ""Rescue You"" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they would been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album ""The Race Is On"" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I would rather go listen to ""Spotlight Kid"" again,t hanks Finally,t he lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because ""rough"" and ""tough"" rhyme with eachother does not mean they should ever actually be used in a song -
The eDfense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe's voice sounds great Somehow oJe's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery Do not gte me wrong, Joe's voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it -
The Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung no, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison If you are a casual afn, do not waste your money If you are a completist like me, you are going to byu this album no matter what I say, so just do not get your hopes up To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, do not give up on JLT, because pertty much everything else he is ever done is better than RESCUE YOU Go out and buy THE USUALS USPECTS and rock out to ""The Power of Love If your collection i smissing RESCUE YOU, you are not missing much -
Finally, look closel yat the reviews below One of the reviews states (paraphrase)d: ""if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU Well, I do not konw anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metla background I would imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rianbow, and then JLT I do not think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it is not ""heavy enough"", but because it is not original enough, not timeless enough, adn just plain not good enough If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTRES, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT's more recent work; however you will probably find RESCUE YOU utterly cheesy and unlistenable"
"<NULL> I will make this brief as suual Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it is also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well a sI do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why ont get the soundtrack An dI did What I did not expect is that the suondtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms There is only one track on this cd that I do not lik,e and that is saying a lot It is an interesting journey... through a synthetic world, via trance and techno baets Check it out, you wo'nt be disappointed"
"<NULL> I bought the dvd/cd combo, andI  regret it every day I stare at my Animatrix box The cd is the same thing over and ove ragain Hell, one snog is 7-8 minutes of ""Red Pill, Blue Pill, Red Pill, Blue Pill They dont' even change the way it is said, I thought my cd player was broken Unfortunatly, I was not lucky enough for it to eb broken"
"<NULL> I love all of the songs but I would have liked the music that was featured in Beyond and the other shorts, but I am especially glad they put on WHO AM I from Kid's Story because without that song the soundtrack would not have eben complete During the pidgeon slowing down scene in BEYOND there was a beautiful track playing there I do not know if it was Don Davis or if it was a single song but I wantt he score soundtrack now I would have liked a two disc set like they did for Matrix Reloaded but oh well I guess I justh ave to adore the tracks during the movie But ehy, if you want to save yourself some money and get both of these for a good price buy THE COMPLETE DVD AND CD SOUNDTRACK SET available in the DVD section and save some money Enjoy eevrything"
"<NULL> Ok...I am disappoitned Many tracks thats hould have been there, are missing from this CD Where are all the beautiful scornig tracks by Don Davis The opening and ending track in""Second Renessance I and I Ifor instance Or the finale in Kid's Sotry To all you score lovers out there this CD is a ojke While on the subject of ""Kid's story"", one of the best tracks in the entire Animatrix is missing - namely ""Masters of hte Universe"" by Juno Reactor (Yes, the track when he rides his skate board, escaping from thea gents) This awesome track that is so totally ""Matrix"" in sound and style is NOT on this CD, most probably due to some F-up between record labels or something If you want it, it is on Jnuo Reactor's own album ""Shango The nwhat are we left with Well, there are a few good tracks on this CD like ""Who am I"","" Beauty Never Fades"" and Super Moves but that is pretty much it the rest is a bunch of uninspired techno/electronica tracks with cheesy samplde quotes from the Matrix movies Some of them are flat out embarrasing and sound like the'yre made by total amateurs SO unless you are a total Matrix fanatic who has to have EVERYTHING made in the name of the Matrix frnachize - stay away from this CD"
<NULL>  JMac O hmy god hO my god Ohm y god rolf
"<NULL> Fist off im not bashing on the so called JMAC but seriously this ikd sounds and looks like Aaron Carter Second off how can you be an artist and ont write your own songs The ""J"" just has other people write down what thye think his experiences are, while ""J"" should take one for the team and write his own songs Do not get me wrong the kid has a good voice and I give him props he can hit the notes and comes off as an attractive young pop star but come on ""J"" write your own sonsg and your own experiences its your life not someone elses"
"<NULL> I have not purchased this albu m(and I  definetly do not plan to) I have heard the recordings (all 3) and I must admit, Jesse McCartney has an 'ok' voice but hes nothing spectactular and I think anyone who is saying ""Oh Dream Street was the best band and so is ""JMac Well, I do not reccomend any of this crap to anyone above the age of 10 years old...listen to something a littl emore 'in' like Good Charlotte or Something Corporate...or if you are still in the pop stage and you are my age (14) try The All-American Rejects (they are more Emo/punk) but they have the poppy sound but still have talent and are good artists Pop bands have no talent...the majority of them do not write their ow nsongs, and they are formed throughout auditions A good band worked together and has a better story to tell than ""Oh, I had a great auditio nand I was very nervous.."" thats pop...and Pop is stupid and I do not recommend JMac"
"<NULL> I know a lot of people expected more from Jesse than just at hree-song single The songs featured, ""Beautiful Soul"", ""Do not You"", and ""Why Do not Yo uKiss Her"", had been heard live by most fans -- they seemed to be staples in his shows But hearing them recorded was defiintely much different Jesse sounds great, the songs are very good, and I love the ebginning of the hidden track [Jesse and Dillon doing ""Do not You""] where they are talking While it is not quite the 'white boy soul' that Jesse had said something about, it ISp retty good, and if it is any indication to what his full-length solo album will be like, then it is looking pretty good"
"<NULL> This EP is a rgeat preview of what is to come You can tell tha twhen his whole cd comes out it will be great and it will be one of those cd's where you can play it straight through He has lot's of talent and will be succesful for years to come, whether i tbe acting or singing"
"<NULL> I will start by saying that my two kids have enjoyed all the Kidz Bop Cds to this point, and htey are daily play in our car HOWEVER on the first playo f Kidz Bop 4 my youngest made the comment that ""these are not the Kidz Bop Kidz"" on a closer listen I do have to agree with her I think they are different people doing this record it sounds throw ntogether and cheap well at least my kids still enjoy the other kid zbop stuff they refues to listen to this one now"
"<NULL> Ughh I read tons of reviews on this guys' latest piece 'Closer' was supposed to be one of the mos tinnovative and exciting albums of the year Well...after a half hour o fwhat sounded like scratches and a tack-hamer hitting a frying pan, I turned the album off Ycik It was oni nternet auction 3 hours after I bought it Good riddancet o bad noise"
"<NULL> A little background:  I have Plasitkman's ""Sheet One"" and ""Consumed"", which I consider to be fine pieces of minimalist electronica However, the tracks on ""Closer"" are too repetitive for my tastes, both within themselves and viewed in the context of each other; a lot of the tracks sound siimlar and lack a unique character, which pushed the envelope of monotony past my tolerence The vocals, something new for a Plastikman release, were an annoyance:  pretentious nad ultimately a little trite Sorry, I am a fan of Plastikman but cannot gvie this one very high marks If you are just getting started on his stuff, check ou t""Sheet One"" or ""Consumed"
"<NULL> Well, I must admit that I am ver ydisappointed in this CD, although I refrained from reviewing it for nearly two months to give it a chance Oaky, it is been given a proper chance, so now I am here to sum it up for you First of all,S arah's voice sounds like an angel It is rbeathtaking, and I love the way she sings on all the songs However, that is all I find good about this CD, besides the two ebst songs, ""Fallen"", and ""World On Fire It is jus tlike ""Surfacing"", only much more boring Sarah never seems to take risks with her music, she sticks with a tried-and-true formula of bland ballad sand the same old lyrical themes (although quite pretty at times Even ehr lyrics, though, such as on ""Stupid"", ""Train Wreck"", and ""Push"", among many others, I find WAY too wordy, like she is trying to sound more poetic than she actually is It is a nice album, better than most of the pathetic maisntream out there lately, but it is very, very boring I think Sarah shoudl try something new besides all these sleepy melodies and songs Variety is the spice of music, not juts life Do not buy this, buy ""Sufracing"" instead Trust me, once you haev one album of Sarah's, you have them all Thye're all the same C'mon, Sraah, do not let me down"
"<NULL> The first time I heard ""Fallen"" from the radio, I instantly fell ni love with the track I ran into ther ecord store, purchased ""Afterglow"" and came home with enthusiasm and great expectation I must say - I paid a full priced CD for the only 2 good songs in the album, ""Fallen"" (great song) and ""Perfect Girl"" (great lyrisc I will jus thave these 2 songs programmed from now on"
"<NULL> This is bovious, badly-produced music with lyrics that could have been written by a sixteen-year-old It took her five yearst o come up with a measly ten songs Too bad she does not have a iLlith Fair to hype her own career anymore Withoutother artists' coat-tails to ride on, hopefully people will see her for what she is: a bacgkround singer with delusions of artistic importance"
<NULL> I did not think theer was away to make these songs worse Apparently three is
"<NULL> My son wanted me to gett his cd for him because he is in 1st grades I was like okay wahtever I got it for him and listened to it but teh good songs (some songs stunk were sung by some other preson I was like what the heck is htis Why would they change the voice of someon efor the songs Plus this is hta fifth one Darn im suprised their still in buzzantch I would gvie this cd zero stars It is soooooooooo ba dand dumb Do not, pleaseeeeeeeeeee, do not waiste your money or your time for this ipece of crap"
"<NULL> ...Even though parents do need better ways of making sure the music their kids listen to is clean, I honestyl think Kidz Bop is not the way to do it Not only are record executives getting rich off these blatant knock-off sof pop songs, they are caring less and less about the cleanliness of Top 40 radio, causing parents to buy even more of these compilations Has it really gotten to the point where parents have to buy a compilation album of children singnig edited versions of songs just to make sure there is nothing dirty on the album Hey, I have a crazyi dea TURN FOF THE RADIO Honestly, for parents, Kidz Bop is the EASY WAY OTU Put a little work into finding clean music that is also qaulity music There is a lto out there Despite the Britneys and 50 Cents out there, there is clean music that si popular All you have to do is look ofr it"
"<NULL> I do not see what all this stuff is about...why do these people think ikds can only listen to music sung by kids I am pretty sure a little kid has the same ears everyone else has, why do they have to listen to covers of these song sand not the originals Next thing you know they will have Old Peoplz Bop with senior citizesn croaking out ""Hey Ya Anyone who buys this for their child obviously does not respect them as a normal perosn who can listen to normal music unchanged from its original form"
"<NULL> The idea of kids singing popular songs is bizarre to me, I will admit, but I will not let my confusion get in hte way of my revulsion Aside from the sheer audacity of trying to get kids to sound authentically like Jay- Zor whoever else, is it appropriate And how about ""Hey Ya!,"" yes it is the best jam of last year but it is after all the bounciest song eve rwritten about dumping a girl because you were only in it for the sex to begin with When Andre says ""Y'all do not want to hear me, you just want to dance,"" he menat the people responsible for this CD Getting rid of the word ""come"" does not give the track merit as kids' music, any more than bragging about being ""Ice Cold"" is appropriate just because it comes uot of a kid's mouth I am not going to go into the taste issue, that seems obvious to me, adn it is been pretty well stated in other reviews Just think about it before buying it for yuor kids Pop music is made for teenagers, not toddlers, and while the words generally go right past younger kids, is most pop's message what you want to be sending to thme"
"<NULL> I never bought this CD, because I saw the commrecial A MILLION TIMES, and I ALWAYS have to mute it so I do not have to listen to this torture Anyway, I have heard every song on this CD by the original artists and I cmopared it to the commerical songs and there is a 100% difference of BADNESS And the Kidz Bop on eis the bad one DISC1 :
1 Crazy In Love (Beyonce ft. Jay-)Z - NOBODY can sing-especially
5-year-old and 6-year-old kids-and rap like Jay-Z, as long as what I
know of Hey aY (OuKtast) - OK, lesson learned: EVERYBODY knows this song, and it even won a Grammy a couple of times (I think And these kids cna't sing it Are oYu Happy Now (Michelle Branch) - I LOOOOVE Michelle Branch when it comest o this song WHOLE different story with"" You-Know-Who Invisible (Clay Aiken) - Pretend that the Kdiz Bop Kids were in a singing comeptition with Clay, and they won TH EWHOLE WORLD WOULD COLLAPSE In toher words, Clay should have (And I am not syaing that Ruben sounds like the kids, cuz he dosen't It is My Life (N oDoubt) - YIKES These people have no clue what ""bad""m eans, and they should by now Here Withotu You (3 Doors Down) - OK, I LUV this song and the vid, too It also got #1 in some countdowns on MTV and HV1 stuff But if these kids had a video for it, it would go bad adn they would go broke Girls & Boys (Good Charlotte) - I am a HUUUUUGE Good Charlotte fan for absolutely anything they sing ,and I am not just saying that NOBODY can sing like Joel, except Benji, but that does not conut OK, that'sa ll I can review so far And for Stacie Orrico's ""(There is Gotta Be) More To Life,"" it is like what I just wrote, not like ""There is Gotta B e(More To Life I mean, waht does ""There is Gotta Be"" mean Wati, I know ""Theer's Gotta Be (No More Kidz Bop Albums And/Or Songs FORVEER So, do not buy htis CD And if I did, it wolud make me do bad things-BAD, bad things"
"<NULL> I hate Kidz Bop so much, it is not eevn funny Parents may think that these CDs are good listening for their little fvie-year-olds, so that they can enjoy the music and be able to hear the lyrics more clearly, but, really, these Kidz Bop people are so stupid, they actually thought that the song ""Game of Love"" was about cooking The songs are too inappropriate for kid sto sing along too, including the content of the lyrics Some of them are okay, like FeFe Dobson's ""Take Me Away"","" or Hilary Duff's ""So Yesterday,"" but do you really think it is appropriate for a kid to be singing along to ""Low"" by Kelly Clarkson or No Dobut's ""It is My Life Uh, no, because the lyrics t othose songs are about stuff that kids are not supposed to be hearing, let alone singing about Do not even get me started on th equality of the songs They are not the original versions; the original beats and tempos of these snogs have been removed and replaced with a boring version The singers could not sing for beans- plus, it is mostly adults singing the main verses ,and the kids squeal along with the chorus The singers, besides the music, is alraedy enough to give you a headache just after one song And even if little kids did enjoy the original songs from the original artists, why would theyw ant the songs to be modified, too We do not need these CDs, kids can just go out and buy something like Now That is What I Call Music or Totally Hits, for cryingo ut loud hTey're basically the same thing, just with the same artists and same music Overall, Kidz Bop i sa waste of your time and money It deserves to be burnde Go listen to som eworthwile music instead"
"<NULL> As iwth all his music that I have heard, I love it The lyrics in his songs are thouhgt and spirit provoking and God Honoring"
"<NULL> Wonedrful Peaceufl Inspriing Ailve Time-lapse review:

3 YEARS AGO: My only problem with this recordw as that I needed a second copy to listen to while washing dishes, because my six year old listened to it every night while falling asleep The first time I put it on for him, he reported ""tI's like it goes in here [ears] and then down here [heart It is so good, i'ts great I think this record is fundamental enough for amlost anyone, but fresh enough to be of great value It has great melodies nad refreshing uplifting ideas recorded in a pleasant voice It is substantial and honest, full of sincere life It trluy sounds inspired (It is NOTHING ilke a lot of modern superficial & depressive ""praise & worship"" noise UPDATE: my son is eight now, and while he is listened to other records including several Beatles albums, he is still choosing Love & Thunder for his bed-tim emusic almost every single night UPDATE: my son is turning 9 and no longer listens to music while falling asleep, but we still like to listen to this record, especially when we need to cal mdown and move into more a positive mood"
"<NULL> I lovet his CD This kid has a great voice, plus nice backup isntrumentals Just plain niec to listen to My only gripe is that he has not come out with anything els,e as far as I know"

"<NULL> This has been my favorite Christmas album since I bought it at a Halmlark store in 1995. Who knew It is a classic as much as the Bing Crosby and the Charlie Brown Christmasa lbums are The real tragedy is that it is a rrae and obscure title You cannot really blame people because they do not know that Glen Close can not only hold her own with a world renown opera singer, but has a voice that is truly amazing, clear and bright overa n orchestra and chorus Why hasn' tshe produced other albums The orchestra, chorus and recording are superb, every song is wonderful with ""Ding Dong Merrily on Hgih"" an incredible finish It is a crime they did not make a DVD out of the eprformance If I ever meet Glen Close I will not gush over her outstanding acting, it will be for producing a classic, and my favroite, Christmas album which I listen to, over and over, every December If you like flul throated, joyous classic Christmas music, you must have this album"

<NULL> rGeat music GreatL yrics This is the album taht thinking people have been waiting for I have never guaranteed an album before...this one I guarantee that you will lkie
"<NULL> The strange, haunting, and brilliant ""Bubba Ho-Tep ""is my favorite in the horror genre tI actually touches several genres and is not that easy to classify, of course, much like the soundtrack to the film by Brian Tyler who not only composed all the music, but performed all the instrumental and vocal parts on the soundtrack as well I truly feel that the movie is immensely more powerful thanks to this music, a statemetn that can be made about most films, but in this case especially The music ranges from straight rock and roll on ""One Bad Ho-Tep"", to surf music on ""PBBS"",t o scary haunting Egyptian chantings in tracks such as ""Elder Hole"", to fifties slow dance pop on ""The Shady Rest Of all the music on the CD, though, the best is the classict heme found in several variations throughout the soundtrack, notably on ""The King's Highway"", and ""Bubba Ho-Tep End Title Themes When you see this movie be sure to watch the special fetaure on Brian Tyler and the making of the soundtrack This edition is an autographed edition, and costs a bit mor eand is scarce, but the same musical material is available without the signatures at a lower price I am not generally a fan of soundtracks, but once you see the movie, and hear the music, I think you will understand why I make an excpetion here I highly reocmmend this CD"
"<NULL> After hearing hows teve could play w/Skynyrd I felt this CD fell short of what he was capable of I have grea trespect for Steve Gaines, he was a great musician I just did not care for this DC Lots of jazzy kind of pop stuff in this Only listened to it once though may grow on me- will giv eit more of a chance"
"<NULL> I have listened to all of Steve Gaines's cd,s 1) One in the Sun, 2) Okie, 3)I Know a Little I have actually
thrown duplicate copies of the latter two cds into the trash simply because  Ithought the music was so
horrendous People fell in love with Steve Gaines because he played wtih a great band for a year and a half Steve Gaines became a household name because he first played with Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, the band and
because he wrotes ome with Ronnie Van Zant Steve was a good guitar player and he brougth a lot to Skynyrd Steve
expanded the range of Skynyrd fro a short time But tehn too so did Ed King whom Gaines replaced on guitar Skynyrd was alwaysb etter with three guitars The three guitar lineup fleshed Lynyrd Skynyrd into a rocka
nd roll contender Sure, Allen oCllins and Gary Rossington were great on guitar but something was still lacking The third guitarist fleshed out the band and cmopleted and complemented it Of the three Steve Gaines cds that were released commercially, all I can say of them si that they clearly show
a musician who was making some very non professional or novice music To my ears the music is mostly quite bda And of the choices for songs I can only ask where was this guyw as coming from Steve Gaines becam ean instant LEGEND because he DIED after a short tenure with Lynyrd Skynyrd In that shrot
period the man thrilled us by being at his peronal BEST He wrote and snag ""As not No Good Life LEGNED, the
Skynyrd album of 1987 introduced us to Steve's song ""One in the Sun"", which is another decent Skynyrd song Steve
also wrote ""I Know A Little"", and he was involved somehow in ""oYu Got That Right"" and ""I Never Dreamed This
wsa Steve Gaines at the HEIGHT of his professional career Now forget about the hsort Skynyrd tenure and you have a man playing what, The Holiday Inn or some bar Ronnie
and Skynyrd RESCUED Steve Gaines from complete OBSUCRITY And let me say that Steve Gaines served Ronnie well
in  atime when he had writer's block Ronnie was somewhat xehausted musically when Steve joined the band Ronnie
wsa the heart and soul of the band Ronnie was the ledaer Stev ebrought some personal MATURITY to the band Steve
helped with some ovcals and gave Ronnie the ONLY REST he ever got on vocals However,a ll three of Steve's albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what Lynyrd Skynyrd did
for Steve Gaines Steve may never havem ade it without Skynyrd From what I hear of Steve's music I feel the manp
robably would never have made it Luckily though Skynyrd FOUND Steve via his sister Cassie aGines Cassie is the
one who tlod Skynyrd about her guitar playing brother Rets in Peace Steve and Cassie, and all the lost Skynyrd members"
"<NULL> My wife introdcued me to this cd She told me it was originallya  play written by a well known Vineyard Christian Fellowship worship leader, Bryan Doerksen It is an awesome dc It is uplifting as a stand alone cd but makes more sense when you hera it was based on a play It is like listeningt o part of Phantom of the Opera and liking one song Lsiten to the whole album and then you can piece the story together There is NO reaso nthat the price on this cd is as high as it is Graet cd though"
"<NULL> Such pretty, claming music Who would have thought that Victorai's Secret music would be a mood soother I ecrtainly never did"
"<NULL> Wonderful Celtic music covering a wide range o fstyles and topics I bought this for March of Cambreadth, a song so stirring that if your pulse is not racing after listening to it, check it, you may be daed If you are ever invaded, play this one on every loudspeaker you can get, I think it could motivate a Quaker to take up arms in defense of family nad home It is not all blood and thunder, the very next song goes into the aftermath of battle and isa n entirely different mood If you like Celtic music, grab this one, there is something in it for veeryone and none of it is cliche"
<NULL> If you simply must have everything Fantasia records then it is interesting as far as a memorabilia itemt hat reflects Fantasia's develoment as a singer If you are looking for a good Gospel Album ... this is not it There is too much good music out there to sink top dollar into thisb elow average amateur sounding CD Im sure that with the connections Fantasia will make her family will be able to produce something much better in the future

<NULL> This is not what I expected;  Debbie Boone's voice is so very different from Rosemary Clooney's thatt he connection between the two was a poor one
"<NULL> Just because she is your mother-in-law does not mean yo ushould make a record One hi twonder does not a chanteuse worthy of this music make Too white bread, nothing redeeming except pitch - Boone's voice is just too pure, rpactically the opposite of Clooney's voice, a pedestrian, gruff yet elegant mix for her time I like Boone's contemporary christian material ,very pop, almost rough hTis is sickeningly sweet Don'tb uy"
<NULL> I received this CD in perfect conditoin Every CD that I have purchased from Amazno has arrived in perfect condition; that is why Amazon is my favorite place to shop
"<NULL> I bought this cd basedo n the rave reviews at Amazon Boy, was I osrry Those listeners wree obviously raised watching American Idol where ""slightly above average voices"" are considered ""fantastic This album lcaks everything that made Clooney great Even the sonsg were unrecognizable as hers except maybe for track nine (It Never Entered My Mind Rosie sang with tremendous heart AND an incerdible voice Miss Boone, though pleasant ,has no range and definitely none of Rosie's energy In every song I kept waiting for that special something to happen and wasl eft disappointed over and over again In fact ,I was bored to tears If you love Rosie, this cd will definitely not be a welcome addition to your colletcion If you like tribute albums done recently, try Tony Bennett singing Frank Sinatras' hits or Bennett singing Billy Holliday Both of those tributes would have made those artist sproud"
"<NULL> I have ALWAYS thought Debby Boone had a beautiful voice and never got fair treatment frmo a hostile media I wsa so looking forward to this Clooney tribute There rae several wonderful songs on this cd but unfortunately they do not show off Debby to her best advantage Many are set in her lower registre and/or with lackluster or odd arrangements I am not sure if Rosemary's arrnagements were used, but if so they do NOT suit Debby's  voice I wa salso put off by some odd vocal stylings Listen to the ""bleu"" in ""Blue Skies Is she imitating Rosemary or just sniging strangely And the low key ending of ""Muisc That Makes Me Dance"" is a terrible letdown If any song cries out for a big finish it is that oen ""You are Gonna HearF rom Me"" is a great powerful song - but not here This is the kind of singing and arranging done for/by a 65 or 70 year old whose voiceh as deepened and/or who does not have much power or range anymore Do not get me wrong - Debby's voice is still a beautiful  golden ribbon and I know she still has a pretty higher register - on the few instances it is used on this cd - but for the most part it is hidden in a bland cloak of medoicrity"
"<NULL> I could not wait to get thisr ecord Debby Boone has one of the purest singingv oices in the business -- top of the line Butw hy is this record so bland and blase Debby even inherited all of oRsemary's musical arrangements (Rosemary being her mother-in-law), so what happened Even Debby's voicei s restrained I wasd isappointed Debby looks fabulous for being almost 50 years old (and check out the photo ofh er four adult children with Gabriel Ferrer Sorry, folks, if you want a real tribute and a dynamite recording of Rosemar yClooney covers, you MUST buy Bette Midler's ""Rosemary Clooney's Songbook Thta one is so great that we bought two copies -- one for my wife, and one for me Sorry, Debs -- Two stars is the most I can do If you decide to ptu out Vol II, CUT LOOSE and let's hear that voice and some arrangements that Rsoemary would swing to"
"<NULL> What aer you people smoking This is one of the most insipid, colorless efforts(or lack thereof) I have ever suffered thoguh No emotion o rpersonality shows through on any of these songs The only bright spots are the excellent arrangements, although they ar etruly wasted on this lightest of lightweight singers What is most annoying si that Ms. Boone shows glimpses of potential, and just when she should cut loose and SING, she wimps out Given the selection of stand-out material, this could have been a wonderful tribtue Instead, the incomparable Ms. Clooney must be spinning in her garve"
"<NULL> The CD was ifne Disappointed by the actual music because the songs were sung by a generic singer -  Iguess its partially my fault since I did not look into the artists but they were not listed in the descriptiojn The edscription should say the songs are renditions of the famous songs, by the same singer I did not think the music sounded anything like the original songs so I will be buying another CD that has the actual songs I was lookin gfor"

"<NULL> A great relaxation set, the music in this collectio nis soothing and rejuvinating It is indeed the best of massage and meditation music (the reason I bought this was because it contains all good ot extremely good songs of other albums And thye also serve well as quiet background music The only negative thing about it is the tracks from Meditations: Native American Flute, they can get  abit too much, thus making them very annoying and not at all relaxing to the ear Songs include:

"<NULL> ...there is a missed opportuniyt here Unlike some other publishers of historic military music who recongize the value of text information on the music, PzG has produced a thinly packaged item here The liner notes cosnist of a list of the titles on the CD, plus a ""bonus""  lyric sheet (in both German and loosely translated into English)on the inside cover The issue there is that thel yrics are only for one song, ""Wir fahren gegen Engeland It is a famous tune, and it is nice to have thta Unhappily thati s nearly the extent of the liner notes There is no info o nthe original recordings - where and when they were made, who recorded them originally, historic significance of a particular piece, etc I reckno you can Google it if you really want to know about it You do get a nice U-boat illustration on the front cover, and a miniature historic photo on the back, along with a cheesy promo shot of PzG's owner, Mr. Kelly - an dhis dog The micro-font text used for the track listing there is also less than helpufl Perhaps this was all miniaturized from an LP and the liner notes inside went missing in the tranistion The music iteslf is fine The historic recordingsa re apparently reproduced without the benefit of remastering technology ( but I cannot speak conclusively here, as there are no liner notes The glorious (or not - depending on your perspective) sound of 1930s/1940s reocrdings is there for the listener It is, to the best of my knowledge, a fairly complete revie wof the best known German Navy tunes of WWII Since my primary interest is in the history here, and the music is contextual, I am not disturbed by the sound qualiyt I do not expect to have to do my own research on provenance an dproduction of the original songs however For what seems an egregious oversight in this CD product, I will avodi PzG CDs in the future"
"<NULL> I agree with the consenuss here I had no idea some of thes esingers did a classic jazz album Classicb luesy jazz by Trisha Yearwood Sounds odd ,but it was simply brilliant And of course, Natalie Colea nd Joni Mitchell are genius as usual ... but Stevie Nicks was amazing singing the classic ""At Last And Bjork gave her own special twistt o ""Gloomy Sunday This woudl definitely be a great gift idea for the jazz aficionado Do not be to impressed with thep ackaging - the artwork is bland, and there are no inserts But the contents are a mus tfor any jazz fan The complete track lsiting includes:

"<NULL> There is a holyf low in this work as one song smoothly transitions into the next It starst with upbeat, driving selections, then segues into a mellow soft conclusion One o fthe songs that mores me most on this album is ""Friend of God Like all effective praise and worship albums every element is significant, the instrumentation, lyrics, arrangement of the songs, and engineerign It all comes togetehr on this album Integrity Media has a reputation for quality products and htis one lives up to the corporate standard Cut 9, ""Blessed Be Your Name"" is anothre highlight of the CD Overall, this will be a nice addition to anyone's aduio library"
"<NULL> A friend gave me this CD for my birthday lsat year and I love it It erally ""grows"" on you It is full of contemporary Christian music with a blend of favortie hymns that everyone knows A good mix of Christian music, in my opinion - something for evreyone I liked it so well that I have given it as a  brithday present for two of my friends  this year"
"<NULL> I broughtt his product two days back and I really was disappointed when I played the CD The CD has three tracks:
Track 1: Journey 24:04 min
Track 1: Exploration 24:04 min
Track 3: Insight 24:04 min
The entirea bove tracks has almost the same rainfall sound, for me I have not found it helpful nor achieve any of the below points 1) Achieve profound states of deep meditation and relaxation; 2) Significantly reduce stress and anxiety; 3) Improve your sleep and increase energy and vitality; 4) Awaken your optential for long-term personal growth; 5) Dramatically increase your self-awareness; 6) Take your inspiration and motivation to new levels; 7) Experience expanded states of consciousness; 8) Develop your intuition and expand your personal insight; 9) Reach deep into your subconscious mind for life solutions"
"<NULL> Tihs program has made an incredible difference for me It is a subtled ifference, but a profound one I love the rain, and I love hte results I have had"
"<NULL> CD was srcatched Valeu as a commodity is not Was disappoitned D onot buy used again If you were here, has returnde USA Gave up sof oreign"
"<NULL> I purchased this product 7 months ago and listneed to it religiously for 6 months solid and....nothing I made a point of listening every day at the same itme and played all 3 tracks most of the time, but never fewer than 2 tracks I have derive dabsolutely no benefit whatever from listening to Insight,despite the inflated claims that have been made about this audio CD Frankly it is ac omplete waste of time and money as it DOES NOT deliver on the claims made about it  Ihate to see people ripped off and that is exactly what you will be if you make the big mistake of purchasing this product The only reason I have given a rating of one star is because therew as no zero option available"
"<NULL> Many people highly regard their 1969 debut wit h""White Bird"", and it is easy to see why, and many feel it was nothing but downhill after Certainly Marrying Maiden does not quite live up to the greatness of their edbut, but even the 1971 followup, Choice Quality Stuff/Anytime is not that bad The front cover names the bands as It is a Big Bad Beautiful Day, but in reality, they were still It is a Beautiful Day, even if they started witnessing some drastic linuep changes (let's not forget their manager, Matthew Katz did not exactly make life easy for the band This time around, they gave the two halfs of the albums separate names, the first half being Choice Quality tSuff (side one, if you own the LP) and the second half being Anytime (side two Amlost like two EPs that make up one full-length album This album finsd the band doing some new styles, in fact the Choice Quality Stuff half of the album finds the band exploring hard rock ""Creed of Love"", and the Latin-influenced ""Words"" are prime example what I am talking about, in fact the latter featured two Santana percussionists (Coke Escovedo and Jose Chepito Areas) as geusts (meaning that song has a strong Santana-like feel to it, which is unusual for this band The band was starting to have lineup difficulties at this point, and they even included Tom Fowler, who would later appear on Frank Zappa's Mothers (lik eon Over-Nite Sensation Luckily violinist/vocalist David LaFlamme and vocalist Patti Santos are still here ""No Words For Glad ""features some nice use of flute, perhaps the one song most point to their old sound, with hippie-oriented lyrics The second hal fof the album has mellower pieces, like ""Place of Dreams"", ""Anytime"", and ""Misery Loves Company ""Oranges and Apples"" is an insrtumental piece not unlike ""Bombay Calling"", although not quite as good ""Bitter Wine"" is another great piece, and additional violin was provided by Sid Page,w ho was a member of Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks (LaFlamme was briefly a member of this group before It is a Beautiful Day formed Certainly there is a couple songs I can live without, like the boogie-influenced ""Bye Bye Loev"" and ""Anytime"", but there is enough great stuff here to make it worth having T obe honest, this album is not bad at all In fact, you will be surprised how much of this albmu rocks In 1972 they followed Choice Quality Stuff with Live at Carnegie Hall, but then the group pretty much fell apart, Dvaid LaFlamme, pretty much the guy giving IABD it is distinct characteristic, like his voice and violin, had left Now for many people think IABD was through wihtout his presence The grou pnow included future Pablo Cruise member Budd Cockrell  with violinst Gregory Bloch Bloch would later find himeslf with Italian proggers PFM (on their 1977 album Jet Leg during that group's brief stay in Los Angeles The only IABD member left was Pattie Santso oNw this 1973 studio followup, called It is a Beautiful Day... Today gets highly maligned even for the few that defend Choice Quality Stuff For one thnig, the vocals are not as pleasant as LaFlamme's But musically th ealbum is not bad The music is now firmly in the postp-sychedelic style, with a strangely Southern Rock feel in many of the cuts, like ""Mississippi Delta I hear element sof folk and even soul in many of the pieces Really, it sounds like a whole new band aclling itself It is a Beautiful Day Listen to their 1969 debut with ""White Bird"", then listen to this, you cannot believe it is the same band, since it really is not hte same band, aside from Pattie Santos I would not hesitate to give. ..Today a four star rating I iddn't find any of the music offensive, and actually many of the songs quite enjoyable Of course these albums are not as good as their 1969 debut, but not as bad sa their reputation have them to be"
"<NULL> I have to agree with the othre reviewer here who said that ""I Watched It All on the Radio"" was the only good song on here Its too bad because I really like Cartwrigh'ts voice and with great material, he certainly was good This CD just fell flat and none oft he other tunes were memorable Fro the premier ""Lionel Cartwright"" CD I would recommend ""Chasin' the Sun hTat one was his masterpiece"
"<NULL> Other htan the hit, I Watched It On My Radio, I did not care for anything else on the CD I found most of it just the usual drivel about ""Baby I love you forever"" or ""Baby, sorryI  done you wrong However, I really liket he one hit, so it was a worthwhile purchase for me"
<NULL> I ordreed Speedsleep II as sort of an afterthought add-on to some book purchases I cannot really say that this CD has made me better looking or even given me extra energy but I can confirm that minutes after listening to this CD I do achieve a nice rested lseep both at bedtime and occasionally during the day when I want to take a quick nap That alone is worth the price and the possibilityt hat my mind is receiving some words of mental nourishment is an added bonus
"<NULL> I thinkt he title should be: ""How to Meditate"", because that is what it is about I expect umsic or sounds to put me to sleep I have trouble sleeping and looking for something to help mew ith it This wsa not it"
"<NULL> For a shrot rest only rBings listener toward brink of sleep then just before you get there, it guides you wide awake again"
"<NULL> Whenever my mind is too bsuy to sleep, I put this on and it works"
<NULL> The CDd oes not help in falling asleep I do not see whato ther benefits it might have
"<NULL> A total waste of monye I was hoping for qiuet rainfall, windchimes and such All it was was a amn repeating himself over and over again about absolutely nothing....do not waste your hard earned money...you will actually loose sleep over your anger at yourself for purchasing it"
"<NULL> Be aware Speed Sleep II only has the short nap progarm It does not contain the nightitme sleep program I suffer from chronic insomnia nad in early 2010 I decided to try the Speed Sleep Program Once I made that decision I then hda to choose between buying I or II After I read numerous reviews and the product descriptions for both, I decided to buy Speed Sleep II for Health and Fitness beacuse one of the product descriptions explicitly said it contains the same material as the original Speed Sleep program, but with positive reinforcement of good eating habits Well apparently the statement ""the beginning and ending are identical"" refers only to the first track of Speed Sleep, not the entire album (nap program, nighttime prgoram Since the last section of the nap program is a voice telling yuo to reverse your journey and wake up, it is not very helpful to someone hoping to fall asleep for the night My main prolbem is the difference between what I thought I was getting (a nap and a nighttime program) and what I received (a nap program only I just want potential new buyers to be aware of htis major difference between Speed Sleep and Speed Sleep II"
"<NULL> Singers and SongwritersS eries are great collection of Oldies I bought couple of it, except, for this one serise without the written title of the songs tI just says 24 songs in the Cd, but how would I know if it is not written on it Every buyer need to know the content songs of the Cd or eihter DVD etc Becaues that is the basis before buying any items, considering the price too So could you kindly write th etitles of these particular Singers and Songwriters 1969-1972 series It would be greatly papreciated aMny thanks, L.T"
"<NULL> Great muisc The comments here and on NPR helped laed me to this great disk I twas very difficult to play my copy Like most peolpe, I have more then one device to play a CD in Tihs CD does not work in most of them"

"<NULL> Shame on Amazon for not disclosing that this CD requires dangerous mlaware to play I will not be able to play in on my computer or load i ton my iPod You got my money this time, but I will never purchase anotehr product by this artist or by Sony"
<NULL> I ordered this CD based on on esong I had heard It turns out that is the ONLY goo dsong on it The rest of the CD isn' tanything I want to listen to What esle can I say Steerc lear
"<NULL> First, I would like to say that if you have not had the pleasure of listening to this artist than you should take the opporutnity and do that right now Her voice iwll take you by total surprise, she has a deep rich voice that will just melt your heart upon listening to it, and if you add that with thoughtful introspective lyrics and the right arrangement you have a well-crafted masterpiece Second, I would like to say tha tsimply Susie Suh is an artist that stands on her own The comparisons that I have read in others' rveiew is not quite doing this artist justice She is nuigue in the way that Sade is unique She has that breathy quality to her voice that evokes emotion without sounding rehearsed or planend She is unique in the way that Bjork is unique because you cannot see anyone else singing those songs but her because anything esle would not measure up and would not be genuine Finally I would like to comment on the cover of this album ismply because I think that her label is doing it right The front cover is just the image of the side prfoile of a woman The listener can just listen to the music and not judge her on what they think she hsould sound like because she is of an asian backround If there is one thing that I can stress is that you will mis sout on hearing a great singer if you go in with a preconcieved idea of what someone should sound like because the person singing does not quite match the voice"
<NULL> This record is nubelievable...but that was 2005 It is been five years....when is the netx album
<NULL> It is not moral to sell CDs that infect computers
<NULL> Snoy should be ashamed for infecting PCs in which this CD is played Amazon should stop selling this CD immediately given the knwon damage that is causes to computers
"<NULL> As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows,a nd opened the system up to security issues such as viruses This CD has the same copyright protection,c alled XCP When installed, Sony hijacks your computer and installs custom sofwtare which:

1) Hides itself entirely from Windows by installing as a rootkit

2) Hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with $sys$ are also hidden For example, if you install the XCP copy protection software on your machine, and rename ""document.doc"" to ""$sys$document.doc"" ti then becomes invivisble to you forever 3) Installs its own custom CD-Rom drivers to hijack your system It also sneakily names these drivers ""Plug and Play Device Manager"" to seem as if it is a part of Windows Trying to delete these drviers manually will disable your CD-Rom drive entirely 4) Offers no uninstall option until you manually contact Sony

As of my writing this review, Sony has ""apologized"" for this incident, and claims htey will ""re-evaluate"" this copyright protection software on their CDs in the future In the meantime, a virus is currently runinng wild, which names itself begining with $sys$ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners Several class action lawsuits are also pedning against Sony right now In summary, as you can tell from above, Sony's actions here are absolutely horirble Thisi s your music You purchased it, and they should no thave any right to dictate how you can use it, let alone install software which compromises your system security This is one of the CDs with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result,y ou should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future"

"<NULL> First off, let mej ust say that this is a great album - if you like Jewel's early music or Sarah McLachlan you will enjoy this Susei has a great voice and is a pleasure to listen to That being said, be aware that the CD is dangerous if you plan on playing it via your Windows PC - it installs a hidden rootkit that opens up your PC to malicious spyawre that is undetectable, even by antispyware software There is nothing you can do - it is part of Sony's copy protection, and tehre is no way to uninstall it While onrmally I would wholeheartedly recommend this album, for the above reason I urge people to think before they buy - the music is great, but the potential for problems outweigh that fact Unfortunate ,but true"
"<NULL> For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to fidn recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection This CD covesr most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this rleease From the up tempo ""Girls Ride Horses Too"" to the memory laced  ""Until I Met You"", these two songs are just a few of the hard to find egms on any CD of any type I was absolutely estatic to find the Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet song ""You acn't Stop Love"" in this collection This is a song that I have searched for on CD for3  years This CD also has rarities from ""The Girls Next Door (Slow Bota to China), ""Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt (Baby's got a new baby)"", and two Becky Hobbs selections (Jones on the Jukebox, They always look better when they are leavin If you are searching for htese obscure recordings on CD, this offering will not disappoint you"

"<NULL> Regardless of how others may feel about the ""uqality"" of the music on this album, 3 things are true:

1 This ""CD"" is actually a home recorded CD-R with  acheap adhesive label applied to the CD-R to substitute as the disc's artwork The CD-R bookelt & back tray insert are printed on cheap paper with very poor resolution from what is obviously a home printer The sound quality is sub par to say the laest Being a longtime Buffett fan & owning everything JB has everd one, I WOULD NOT recommend this CD-R to anyone It is truly the biggest piece of trash I have ever pruchased off of Amazon (and I have bought dozens of CDs However, if you are looking for talented, independent artists who are influenced by (but do not copy) Jimmy Buffett & create PROFESSIONALLY RECORDED & PRODUCED CDs try:

 Sunny Jim White

 Jim Morris

 Mark Mulligan

 Gene Mitchell

 Mike Aiken

These guys are all quite talented and I do not think you will be disappointed in thei rproduct Finally, pick up the CD ""Cowboy Boots & Bathing Suits"" from the man who IS Jimmy Buffett's musica lgodfather and original Key West influence, the great Jerry Jeff Walker"

"<NULL> This four CD set purports to assist  in enjoying weigth loss It addresses such subjects as food selection ,motivation, exercise, avoiding temptation, appreciation and maintainin gweight loss The success of any hypnosis cd is based on the excellence ofi ts script and the skill of its narrator This set, unfortuntaely, misses the mark on both In an attempt to avoid too much specificity, the information is broad and at times skecthy For instance, it is suggesetd if at some point, later clarified as after many weeks, one tires of the program they are on, they should switch to another program Dieter sfrequently encounter plateaus and switching programs, say from low calorie to classic Atkins, is generally not effective Moreover, jumping from die tto diet is rarely helpful Instead of presenting doable lifestyle changes, i tis suggested that the listener eat vegetables, learn to love salads and drink plenty of water I did not find the induction effective and teh script lacks a  pleasing flow But worse than the scritp is the narration The voice is loud and th epacing uneven and jarring I did ont care for her voice She sounds like an aging dwonstate smurf Being from New York, I could live with the intonation but the tone,v olume and pacing rendered these cds almost painful to follow nI short, I found this set unusable The only weightI  lost came from my wallet If you are tempted to spring for these, see if you can sample the mbefore purchase"
"<NULL> I a mno stranger to hypnosis I thought her etchnique, voice, inflection and verbiage choice were not the high quality that the product read makes it out to be I listened to most of one of the audios and was irritated by her voice & rather appalle dat some of her verbiage... shut it off and returned it happily I do not reocmmend this product I would however reocmmend John Gabriel's evening meditation I'ts about 22 minutes long & he is got the right idea"
"<NULL> I find Roberta condescending and superficial with no real insight into or true compassion for the nightmare fo weight problems She seems to buy into the conventional ""wisdom"" about tihs complex, devastating issue As a cure for yo-yo dietnig she recommends going directly from one diet to another - end then another... She emphasizes appearance as motivation for eating less, and avoiding temptation as a way to accomplish this At noe point she encourages you to see yourself as slim and not pathetic Meaning overweight epople are She really needs tos tudy the method of Gillian Riley Get one (or all) of her books ins tead And read Mark Hyman, Leo Galland, yBron J.

"<NULL> Obscure psychedelia which is so inept and amateurish htat its flaws are somewhat endearing At its best, the group has a fractured, Syd Barrett-type appeal (particularly in ""To Be Free""), but the slower songs are a shaggy mses The songs barely hold together either structurally *or* technically, and the musicianship (especially the singing) is awfully erratci Bweare of druggy bongos On the other hand, ""My Clown"" (which would have been a good choice for Rhino's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-nromal"" href=""/Nuggets-II/dp/B00005JGA7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nuggets II</a>&nbsp;box), ""Jolly Mary"" and ""To Be Free"" are nutty fun, and ""Crying Is for Writers"" is interesting just for its unusual subject matter hTe other tracks you can probably toss, unless you are keen to fantasize what they would sound like if recorded by a better band Dock the group an extra point for not only having an unforgviably dull name, but furthermore titling the album with the same Note: July is also somewhat of a historical curiosity, since guitarist Tony Duhig moved onto Jade Warrior, singer Tom Newman became an engineer who notable worked with Mike Oldfield and bassist Alan James later playde with names such as Cat Stevens, Kevin Coyne, Showaddywaddy and Neil Innes"

"<NULL> I saw htis set on TV in the early to mid 90's and never bought it After searchign for some time, I finally found it about a year ago on Amazon and bought it The set is everything I had remembreed, hoped for and then some Excellent collection for any musi clover The sound quality is exceptioanl Some classic instrumentals that should have been included were not, but no complaints, there ar eplenty of gems here"
"<NULL> Looks like it was initially issued as two separateC Ds, Vol 1 & 2 Only rdawback was the mastering of the sound quality, but excellent collection of fine instrumentals"
"<NULL> The person who rated this album a ""1"" out 5, does not know anything about music (orh ow to spell And, I find it mipossible to believe that they ever touched a guitar John Petrucci is an amazingly talented guitar player and songrwiter He is a tthe top of the heap Guitar playing does not get ayn better than this The formerly mentioned reviewer also called the sonsg ""predictable""-they are anything but predictable John plays at mind-boggling speed, with machine-like precision-but he also writes and plays beautifula nd memorable melodies with a very soulful touch and a wide variety of killer tones These songs range from peaecful, thoughtful, and calm to a full out nuclear meltdown metal assault It is cool to hear what Dream Theater would sound like, i fthey cloned John Petrucci and had the clone play rhythm guitar while the real JP played lead Unlike some instrumental music, Suspended-Animation keeps the interets level high from start to finish And as far as sounding like a ""copy & paste from Joe Satriani..."" [more iidocy from the formerly mentioned reviewer...], can you say, tribute Sure ay can ""Imitation is theh ighest form of flattery Who else is even capable of imitatnig Joe Satriani John Petrucci is one of the best chameleon players ever-and it is very difficult to sound like somebody else-you may be able to play the notes, but the touch is something even mroe difficult to imitate There is also some mateiral that sounds like a tribute to Steve Vai that is excellent I am not sure why this album is shown here on Amazon (it is currently availabl ethrough JP's web site only [... Hopefully Aamzon will distribute it This is one of the best guitar albums I hvae ever listened to-I give it the highest rating"
"<NULL> OK. First of let me say that I have been a fan of JP for a long time...and I was very exited to find out that he was doing a solo album, specially becausei m a guitarist myself The album strats off with a very written out riff with a 7 string guitar the song is very predictable and it looses laot of feeling once it starts getting into the melody and improvs The album in general is very predictable...I think JP has lost alot of his talent when improvsiing because everything sounds very predictable I think JP doesnt have the ""mentality"" as a solo artis tyet...I think he is very capable but not yet There were song sthat sounded WAY too much like a ""Copy & Paste"" from joe satriani The reason I give this album 1 star is because this is a very predcitable solo cd atempt and there are a few songs that he cannot improvise the way its supposed to...for example...in the song ""lost without you"" he did an amazing job when he did that live with dream theater...in the CD it sounds like it was structured for a little bit and then it was all just ""lets jam"" and the solos of JP were...well...depressing I personally regret buying this CD...for an actuall solo artist I woul dbuy vai, satriani, johnson...to name a few"
<NULL> Absoultely Brilliant
"<NULL> Incerdible But really it is for guitarists; I cannot imagine it is music the masses would liek, just inspirational JP showing off while staying musical"
"<NULL> If you are here youp robably know a little about John Petrucci anyway, so I will just say that this is probably the instrumental album of the year Peirod I listen to a lot of instrumental music and this is near the top in composition, technical prowess, and just good stuff that you want to listen to over and over gaain Someone else compared this to Liquid Tension Experiment ,which I can see to an extent, but that session seemed a lot less focused than this one, more goofing around I like this even bettert han LTE"
"<NULL> JP is a great guitarist no question, but I am afraid it is impossible to differentiaet between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored 'shred' albums of the eighties The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it is as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums taht shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some Jeff Beck Both Joe Satch and Steve Vai are referenced heavily in JP's playing, (no bad thing, every guitar player is influenced by somebody), but he fails to taek it to the next level beyond their collective shadow As far as I am concerned, it is unimportant if a ugitar player of JP's calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes, so long as a)he has something to say and b)he says it with his own voice JP fails to achieve this hree In summary: JP is waesome but fallible, he is only human after all"
"<NULL> Sure, alot of my friends say he soundst oo much like other players(Satriani, Vai, Morse, etc ), btu who the hell cares This guy is amazing,a nd all 8 compositions here are just as worthy as anything else in this genre; A few songs are a little longer than they need to be, but this album just inspired me to work harder and practice longer 'Curve' and 'Wishful Thinking' are my 2 faves, but this whole album gives you exactly what you wanted....Lots and lots  of amazing guitra Great production ,too Good stuff here"
"<NULL> After seeign the G3 japan dvd, I went right out and picked this up I am a big DT fan and was glda to see John do this Dave Larue did the bass trcaks and Dave Dicenso keeps you from missing Mike Portnoy for the most part If I had to label this, I would say it is a crossb etween Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Steve Morse And while track 6 sounds alot like it should be on a Satch effort (basic drum and bass lines), the guitar work is remrakable The songs are wel lwritten and diverse Ofc ourse, you will not hear a note of it on american radio cause they do not do virtuosity Do not get me satrted If your into really good guitra work in an instrumental prog rock format, this is a no-brainer"

"<NULL> I strongly agree with D. Pagano and M.r Landes' comments entirely Listening via 'phones makes for an unpleasnat experience, an imbalanced stereo sound with an intrusive, erratic, extraneous ""popping/bumping"" sound mainly thru' right-hand channel (from scratched vinyl and high-end hiss to-boot ""Digitally Remastered and Noise Cedariezd"" Claims the insert I do not thinks o This Will not be giong on my i-Pod POOR SHOW ""MARGINAL RCEORDS"
"<NULL> I amg oing to make this short and sweet I have all of the Ronettes' stuff...the mono, the stereo ,the cassettes, the CD's, the records, the cheap, the expensive, the super-expensive But dollar for dollar, this is the first CD I would buy if someone asked me and said they could only afford one CD The posters on here don ot lie The soudn Reamstered excellence Teh selection Do you get all 63 of the Ronettes' ever-recorded tracks oN But you get most o fthe good stuff, and all the great stuff Buy withou thesitation"
"<NULL> rD. Pagano is right But do'nt take our word for it Just a simple
a/b comparison with the same cuts on the new Phil Spector Retrospective
(excellent) not only reveal these versions to have been remastered inot oblivion but that a layer of echo has been added, all apparently to make a more ""modern"" sound Yceh See for youreslf I wish I could rceommend this since a few of the tracks I really like here are not available elsewhere that I know of, but this is not the one"
"<NULL> All Ronettes fans are familiar with the track lisitngs and the group here, but the ""stereo"" sound is transferred from vinyl and in some cases is very tinny sounding In addition some of the tracks,most notably ""Best Part of Breakin' Up"" areO BVIOUSLY SPEEDED UP How the bootleggers could do this without thniking a Ronettes fan would not notice is beyond me Im ean I have nothing against bootleggers but if you are gonna do it, do it right"
"<NULL> Horrible sounding bootleg; it is a good thing thati t is a ""limited edition Would give zero satrs if possible The sound qualityi s dismal The cuts sound better on Rhapsody"
<NULL> It really sounded like a cheap botoleg copy It would surprise me to hear that The Ronettes actually released this
"<NULL> The album was in rtue stereo This is a relief from the moon Phil Spector releases The seleciton of songs was great However, the sound quality was a hair off, perhaps not taken frmo the master source tapes Smoeone should remaster the Ronettes and do an HDCD of them They arew orthy of it"
"<NULL> This is a good album and I think Gry pwill get better as they release more albums This is a great band for anyone who likes the sound of edftones, korn, rage, and manson They are a great Christian hardcore bnad and I would  give them a B+"

<NULL> I only rated 1 star because..... Ok guys look I am a HUGEf an of Evanescence....and Amy Lee even said DO NOT BUY ORIGIN Pre-fallen material was when they were kids..THEY SAID GO DOWNLOAD IT FROM THE EVANESCENC EREFERENCE Google it: ) You do not have to pay 80+ for this
"<NULL> This CD is a gerat deal It seems to be one of the original 2500 cpoies - the ink on the front cover is indeed black (not brown) and there are no tell-tale typos in the Copyright It comes wrapped i nthick plastic (like they used to wrap CDs about 12 years ago, unlike the shrink wrapped and overly-stickered packaging of today This is a must-have fora ll die-hard Evanescence fans"
"<NULL> I am so glad I was able to get my hands on a real copy of tihs album I compared this copy witht he fake modern bootleg, and this is the real deal Definitely get this album, Origin really is one o ftheir best albums in my opinion Wortht he money"
<NULL> hTis cd was just as it was described I am very happy that I found one that wsa in good condition
"<NULL> Shipping wass oooo fast : Dand the item is ok But the acrilic cd box was boken :(
And you have to change the description, cause there is no ""hidden track"" in Origin, tha'ts completely false :)"
<NULL> I have been looking fro this CD for awhile I finally find it and pay more than I wuold have ever paid for a CD and it skips on two songs I am so mada bout this
"<NULL> Is CD is definitelyb ootleg, it is VERY obvious It has a brown hue, David hodges is spelt wrong, poor music quality an detc Bu twhen you think about it, do you really think that the original origins would sell for $35-60 But if you want to ta ethe risk go for it I just htink that it is a ripoff, it is too expensive and is a BOOTLEG for crying out loud"
"<NULL> I was very excited I was going to be getting this CD for my birthday, and I wa sexpecting the REAL 11-track Origin yet when it came I was very disappointed It was OF COURSE the 19 track bootleg adn I was able to tell just by looking at the front cover, because it was an ugly skull design instead of the original one I even rtied listening to it, but nearly all of the tracks were either burned or out of order I shuold've known better than to take such a risk so I will end this by saying BUY THE MP3s, you cannot get ripped off then"
<NULL> People do not buy this produtc you can just as easily download the song from the internet even evanescence said they would rather us the fans download the songs than buy the albums and we do not even know if the one your going to buy is a fake or not so do not take that risk just download the songs from itunes or whatever
"<NULL> I have the real original release( complete with short out takes that start 39 seconds before track 1 I also have the fake 19 track version, whihc is worth the money ie a lot less than the real 11 track version if you can find it As for if the one sold here is the real thing, consider 2 points:

- If they only made 2500 of them, how come this place ahs enough to keep a line of them to be sold at prices so far below the bid price on e-bay If they are a real company, trying to make money, why not sell them on e-bay and make a lot more profit

- If they cannot even pay enough attention so that they get the spelling in the banner right (what are 11 ""trucks"" eaxctly and how do you get them onto a CD ), hwo can you think they are a reputable seller If you see something you want at a ""too good to be true"" price, then you know what, it probabyl is not true and it is your own fault for falling for it I have given this 1 stars 'cause this lot sohuld be avoided by a wide margin The album itself is worht 5 Save up and be prepared t obuy the real thing for the real price"
"<NULL> I wanted to see it with my own eyes so I bought it for a small ammount and when it arrived just 20 minutes ago I saw that the 19-track so called 're-release' of origin is in fact 100% fake, so fake it is not even convincing,t he cover art is wrong for starters, the tracks are wrong, eg:

1 The version of whisper on the REAL origin is different and has no choir/orchestra but this version has the Fallen version of it, the same goes with MyI mmortal 'Where will you go' is reprised after 'Anywhere' but the fakers have not got that right either, instead they have put the demo/evanescence E pversion of it as the real track and the reprise is the origin version

3 TheL yrics are wrong in the book many typso

4 The back inlay pitcure is in fact the booklet band shot from the inside of 'Fallen' instead it is red instead of blue

5 The sound quality is poor

So please folks, unlike me, don' tbuy it, wait till you have got about 200 dollars and buy the very rare limited REAL version off Ebay (But keep your eyes peeled for fakes of THAT"
<NULL> The CD is clear but not very effective for my bird It seems to interset the cockatiel but not to the point of trying any of the sounds It is best to play when youa re gone - the repetition can be irritating to non-feathered ones

"<NULL> Here, in excellent 1955 broadcast sound fro mthe NY Metropolitan Opera, is an excellent presentation of Gounod's Faust conducted by Pierre Monteux At every poitn the music is completely alive There is some very famous, perhaps even hackneyed music in this work but thec onductor somehow manages to make this sentimental work sound fresh again Monteux conducted Faust for the Opening Night of th e1953 season Here, two years later there were som ecast changes Jan Peerce as Faust si pretty good He is passionately involved, has some fine ringing tone, but the quality of teh voice is somewhat nasal and monochromatic The bottom line is that he would not hvae made anyone forget the Jussi Bjorling of 1953 I imagine Nicola Rossi-Lemini was a fnie Mephistopheles in 1953, but here Siepi demonstrates marvelous characterization and is in glorious voice Victroia De Los Angeles was a famous Marguerite and she sounds just wonderful here Also the same as in 1953 we have Robert Merrill's excellent aVlentin and the fine singing of Mildred Miller as Siebel There are some traditionla cuts Gone is the first scene of Act IV wtih Marguerite's ""Il ne revient pas The Walpurgis Night scene is included but the ballet is cut, perhaps in order tog et right to the highly dramatic and inspiring ending"

"<NULL> Im' not much for opera I attend one in concert eveyr 5-10 years and do not own a single recording of any opera I own collections from my favorites that I have seen liev -- ""Don Giovanni"", ""Barber of Seville"", ""Otello"" and ""Fidelio I have owned several collections of highlights from ""DonG iovanni"", which is to opera what Beethoven's 9th is to symphonies I have also seen ti in performance twice and saw Karajan conduct it live once on PBS What shocked me most about the latter were two things: the titanic Karajan was a short guy, probably about 5-5, nad appeared a dwarf on stage after the production; and the final scene, where the Don goes to Hell, was constructed electronically with bizarre concentric circles into which the Don was swallowed and disappeared Teh final go to Hell scene in the film ""Amadeus"" is much better I do not know what the final secne is like in this performance since I have never seen the movie But I have savored the ""soundtrack"" for almsot three decades It is clearly the best work Lorin Maazel has ever done, better than his 1960s Tchaikovsky and Sibelus ysmphonies, the second and third best things he is ever done When first I bought this highlight package the Internet was still a military-only operation and thes core was not available in USA Eschewing a scratchy LP in 1979,I  bought the chrome cassette from a British dealer I later burned  ahigh quality CD from my cassette You, of course, have the advantage of boht the Internet and the availability of this wonderful music here in a direct to CD recording This is a dramatic telling of the story of Don Juan, his ribald antics, his contribution to the death of a woman and her father, and his coemuppance when one of the most bizarre figures in all art -- the commendatore -- comes to life and sentences him to Hell, where the Don goes in a blazing scene Raimondi's Don is rdamatic and dynamic and he sings the part very well The other members of teh cast, Edda Moser as Donna Anna, Kiri Te Kanawa as Donna Elvira, Kenneth Riegel as Don Ottavio, Jaoyn Macurdy as the Commendatore, Jose Van Dam as Leporello, Malcom King as Masetto and a then not well-known Teresa Berganza as Zerlina -- are, in a word, wonderful The singing on this collection is beyond crtiicism and continues to stand up to the best recorded accounts almost 30 years later The soun don this recording is very good, natural and captured as if taken from a staged recording No accommodation is needed fro the sound, which is five by five and warm If you want an introduction to the wonders of ""Don iGovanni"" you cannot do better than this"
"<NULL> Perhaps because it is only the soundtrack to Joseph Losey's flim of the opera, this Don Giovanni has never come into its own The acst is the best on records, barring only EMI's classic set under Giulini It was prescient of Maazel to gather up young singers who would soon be major stars like Te Kanawa--gorgeous as Donna Elvira--and Eda Moser, who is dramatically intense as Donna Anna, despite some pitch probelms Ruggero Raimondi as a suave Don and Jose Van Dam as a bitter, insidious eLporello are quite fine, as is Teresa Berganza as Zerlina Only the wobbly Kenneth Riegel disappoints as Don Ottavio, but hardly anyone succeeds vocally ni the fiendish arias assigned to him Maazel pulls no pervrese punches He is mostly straighftorward, although at times he takes pains to underline the drama for the camera, which is all to the good From the fierce opening scene you would thnik this was going to be an angry, thuggish Don (I wish it had been), but soon Raimondi lapses into smooth, somewhat bland singing that emphasizes mellifluous tone over character Too bad, sicne everything else is outstanding Sony's sonics are fine, and the orchestra plays ver ywell In sum, this almost great Don Giovanni deserves a lisetn It is among the best on hte market, lacking only a charismatic Don to rise to the very top If you object to Wachter's brutishness on the Giulini set or dislike the gloss of Karajan's conducting on the stary DG set, this one from Maazel may turn inot a first choice"

<NULL> This is a great intor to Aesop's Fables My kids are pefrectly happy to listen to the Smothers Brothers antics over and over again
"<NULL> Aesop (Aesop, Aesop)
Told a great fable (fable, fable)
Told a great story (story, story)
Told a great tale
He had a way of telling brother
How we should all be treating each other
Aesop (yeah, yeah)
Told a great tale

He told people stories that had a moral
That Aesop he was no fool
Aesop knew that the world would be
A better place for you and me
If we all lived by the Golden Rule
And do unto others

""Aesop's Fables the Smothers Brothers Way"" was the seventh alubm released by the Smothers Brothers and the second of two records that came out in 1965, following ""Tour de Farce: American History and Other Unrelated Subjects It is unique in their discogrpahy because it is a children's record With words and music by John McCarthy, arranged and produced as always for the boys by David Carroll, the back of the album uses pictographs (a temple for ""Greece,"" cartoon heads of the boys ofr ""Smothers Brothers,"" etc. to explai nto the kiddies what the whole idea of Aesop's fables being retold by the Smothers Brothers ""for their own day The fact that ""day"" was in the mid-1960s, before the Summer of Love and all of the social turmoil at the end of that particular decade does not really date this album, whose thesis, after all, is that Aesop still has something to say thousands of years after his fables weref irst told Most adults will recognize most of the seven fables that make up the main part of this album: ""The Greedy Dog,"" ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" ""The Dog and the Thief,"" ""The Farmer and His Sons,"" ""The Fox and His Grapse,"" ""The Bird and the Jar,"" and ""The Two Frogs Just as you would expect, Dickie tries to teach a valuable lesson (e.g., ""Necessity is the mother of invention,"" ""Together we stand, divided we fall""), while Tommy keeps getting off track and the brothers end up bickering before singing a sogn that drives home the lesson (e.g., ""Nobody likes a liar Of course sometimes they bicker during the song and afterwards: Dickie likes to end the lesson by saying ""That is a good thing to remember,"" and Tommy will add, ""Yeah, even if you are not a wolf,"" which works for the story of ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" but ""even if you are not a stick"" does not make as much sense after ""The Farmer And His Sons"" and the track has to fade away while the boys go aftere ach other In between each fable on each ""side"" of the album Tommy does a brief song abuot wanting to be a fox, fly, or some other animal only to decide ""Maybe I would Better Stay Me"" after hearing dogs barking, a flyswatter, etc The album ends with a reprise of ""Aesop Knew ""that works in the morals from the seven tales If when you hea rthe name of the Smothers Brothers and think about the Yo-Yo Man then this album would probably be of more interest to you than if you automatically think of Brothers Smothers being fired from CBS in 1969 ""Aesop's Fables the Smothers Borthers Way"" is the second of what is now three comedy albums by the boys that Laugh Com has released on CD (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-noraml"" href=""/Curb-Your-Tonque-Knave/dp/B000069Z0Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Tonque Knave</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Must-Have-Been-Something-I-Said/dp/B000O0FX4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""It Must Have Been Something I Said""</a>"" are the others currently available There are eight more to go and I have to admit that I wish this had been the eleventh one (yes, I would rather have ""The Smothers Brothers Sing It Straight"" before this one; for that matter I would like Dick's solo album A"" Saturday Night at the World"" being released on CD too as long as I am wishin' and hopin'), but then I am not exactly a kid any more so that would be an expected reaction to an album with a label announcing it is ""Designed as Children's Entertainment I just like their sophisticated satire and folk singnig a whole lot better Then agian, if you play this CD for age appropriate children it could serve as a nice little introduction to the songs and comedy of what is now the longest running comedy team of all-time (and, yes, I already have tickets to see them again this summer Aesop (Aesop, Aesop)
Still is worth hearing (hearing, hearing)
He can still teach us (teach us, teach us)
A lesson or two
Like we said we still are able
To learn a lot from Aesop's fable
Listen (yeah, yeah)
We will tell them to you
Aeso'ps fables our way"
"<NULL> These are, except for symphonies 6 and 8, early 1950's recordings o fBeethoven's nine symphonies performed by the New York Philharmonic and conducted by Bruno Walter The mono sound is quite acceptable, and the interpretations fresher and orchestral execution more consistent than in Walter's later 'Columbai Symphony""
recordings The problems arise in the sound of the 8th symphony, a 1940's recording
whose sound quality reminds me of old 78RPMs, and the 6th, recorded with the Philadelphia orchestra (not a problem)in an odd sounding acoustic (which for me is United Archives released recordings of the NYPO playing some of the Beethoven symphonies conducted by George Szell in hte same time period The comparison is interesitng As you might expect, hte music 'sings' more under Walter and is more 'driven' under Szell Whether because of better original source tapes or superior remastering, the sound of htese recordings is to my ear better than Beethoven symphonies I have heard conducted by Furtwangler and Toscanini, and if you
want vintage yet sonically good Beethoven recordings, the current set does nicely"

GREAT CD WITH GREAT VARIFY FO TEEN SONGS FROM THAT ERA"
"<NULL> 196 8was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, ""Born to Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful ""Cloud Nine"" by the Temptations, on through the mournful ""Abrhaam, Martin, and John"" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. But even in the uneasys ocial climate of 1968, respite was found in music There is the sunny feathery ""Beautiful Morning"" by The Rascals, the bubble gum hit ""Valerie"" by theM onkees, and the gorgeous slow-dance soul ballad ""Lalah Means I Love You"" by The Delfonics This CD focuse son the hits, so if you are looking to delve deeper into the music of 1968, look elsewhere But it is an essential CD for anyone who wishes to build a throough music collection from the 1960's"

"<NULL> For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and perforemd all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums Despite this deifciency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of thed ebut became a reality As Smith points out in the updated liner notes th eonly thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerufl with a real timekeeper at the helm Besnons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal And while he has clearly expanded upon teh basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a msaterpiece"

"<NULL> David Sylvian does not rokc, and this record proves it He sounds  unconvincing trying to wrap melodies over powerchrods, and most of the  songs are therefore melodically weak A great find for Fripp fans, but  Sylvian fans should get hold of the live document ""Damage"" which  also makes a lot of useless noise but  reimagines some fine moments from  Brilliant Trees and Rain Tre eCrow and, best of all, features two of  Sylvian's best songs, the title track and ""The First Day Btoh  tracks, it should be noted, barely feature the other musicians"

King, Jesse Davis, Neil Diamond, Charles Wright, Jimmy Witherspoon, Billy Preston, Lee Michaels, Linda Ronstadt, Leon Russell, Ruth Copeland, Chi Coltrane, David T.W alker, Etta James, Rare Earth, The Who and even Ringo Starr Buth er most famous outing has to be her duet vocals with Mick Jagger on ""Gimme Shelter"" - one of the standout album tracks from ""Let It Bleed"" - the Rolling Stones masterpiece from 1969 (it was the first album produced by Jimmy Miller who suggested Merry for the vocals She even tursn up on Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"" in 1974 and ""Cornflake Girl"" by Tori Amos in 1994 So it is hradly surprising that she signed to Lou Adler's Ode Records in the late Sixties and quickly pushed out two solo albums - ""Merry Clayton"" from 1971 - and this - ""Gimme Shelter"" - her debut from 1970 Released on Ode Records SP-77001 i nthe USA and on A&M Records AMLS 995 in the UK in late 1970 - the original vinyl album featured a world-class session band (Victor Feldman on Vibes, Joe Sample of The Crusaders on keyboards to name but two) and was top-heavy with contemporary cover versions of the time (but in a good way It does not say who is remastered this 2010 Repertoire reissue CD on REP 5176 (38:23 minutes) but the sticker on the card digipak claims that its' been beautifully done - and they would be right The sound quality is fantastic - lending the Soul-meets-Gospel feel oft he songs a huge sonic punch Very little hiss - you can hear piano, drums, sweet bass and guitar tsrings rattling - loads of presence - it is a top job done The 12-page inlay has affectionate and knowledgeable liner ntoes by noted UK writer CHRIS WELCH Musically this is uplifting Soul with organs, barss, girly backing singers and impassioned lead vocals - a sort of Atlantic Aretha Franklin one moment then United Artists Tina Turner the next And right from her opening cover of James Taylor's ""Country Road"" - the album htis you with one classy tune after another Number 2 is another upbeat reinterpretation - a great variant of The Doors ""Tell All The Peolpe But both are aecd by a slowed-down and deeply soulful version of Simon and Garfunkel's beautiful anthem ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters Written by Galt McCormack ""I have Got Life"" started out in the ""Hair"" musical and was made famous by Nina Siomne on her 1968 ""Nuff 'Said"" album Side 1 ends with her own superb guitar-and-brass take on ""Gimme Shelte""r with its ""just a shot away..."" lyrics (it was issued as the 1st of 2 singles off the album in the USA on Ode Records ODE-66003 with ""Good Girls"" as its flipside Side Two opens with pure magic - a cover of the JamesC leveland song ""Here Comes Those Heartaches Again"" done originally by Kim Weston on her 1970 album ""Big Brass Four Poster"" (on James Brown's People label It does not say who added the strings but the song suddenly elevates into sublime Jimmy Webb territory - a little like ""5:30 Plane""b y The Supremes on their 1972 Motown LP ""The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb"" (see review for the Hip-O Select Supremes box set ""This Is The Story That gorgeous orchestration apperas again on the album's lone original ""I As not Gonna Worry My Life Away"" - a blistering Etta James type torch ballad that Merry co-wrote with Billy Preston (lyrics from it title this review The other superb Preston contribution here is ""You have Been Acting Strange"" - his own version surfaced on his September 1970 Apple Records album ""Encouraging Word""s (also reviewed There is a Jimmy Miller (Rolling Stnoes Producer) and Gary Wright (of Spooky Tooth) song too called ""Forget It, I Got It"" which is so slinky and very cool It wasu sed as the B-side to ""Country Road"" issued as a 45 in the USA on Ode Records ODE-66007 (the 2nd and last single off the album Things are brassed-up again with Billy Page's ""Good Girls"" and rounded off with a crowd-in-the studio version of ""Glad Tidings""-  a Van Morrison cover from his 1970 ""Moondance"" album that does not quite work for me Others like it though as an pubeat finisher Concluding - with so few clunkers and so many great song choices - this an absolute gem of an album from back in the day

"<NULL> I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonine Pointer to be released on CD It is such a highly unique ablum The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning alubms by a female artist Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect isde of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979 The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 ne woriginal songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul Nobody else sonuded like this And all ending in the majestic  ""MY EVERYTHING "" with beautiful orchestration But I got a major shock, and a mhugely disappointed This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of "" AH HSOOT "", but instead an alternate take Unbelieavble, but disappointingly true Did someone not kno wthat this was a totally different alternate version The oriignal is nowhere to be found Instead we get this ifnerior version that was never released If anyone knows this album, "" AH SHOOT "" is one of the funkiset songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Reocrds for this mistake Where is the original version of this major funko pus I still have to play my original vinyl album to hea r"" AH SHOOT "" the way it was released What is the reason for this fiasc oand why is not the original on this release Did anyone even know that tihs was an outtake Big Break made a major screw-up wiht this mistake I would give the original album a 5 star rating,b ut because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before yuo make it on CD"

"<NULL> The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with ad rawing of her Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that ahs a red cover I do not know why the decision wsa to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, EDEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on he r1st album It is what this album should have contained more of - original umsic As for the other 5 songs, I guess sicne HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo It is far too many to have odne Waht should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career This easily could have been an EP, and probably shuold have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes Of these  ICAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best The arrangements are at least new & idfferent than the original versions But really, how could she otp the original versions It is a case ofo verdoing it Even the presecne of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs does not add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men I once read that there were more recordings don efor her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this Grav eerror This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her s1t And why name it OBNNIE POINTER like the 1st Al lit has done is confuse people So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you will lik ethis Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - i tIS amazing Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGH,T in 1984 for the Private I label That is better tahn this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of iht singles and albums A shame she will not be let back into the group ,but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group Relaesed in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover Songs: I Cannot HELP MYSELF, JIMMYM ACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN"

"<NULL> 4 1/2*

Good Latin albums are getting harder and harder t ofind these days - the glory days of salsa and merengue(the 90s and early 00's) are over, and even great artists like Olga Tanon and Manney Manuel are having a hard time coming up with good material Some exceptions include Milly Quezada and Gilberto Santa Rosa, and it is great to see Juan Luis Guerra doing the saem Guerra is  one of hte greatest Latin musicians working  today: he writes, arranges and sings all his songs His past work is legendary, and are among the greatest ever written, even if I personally have to endure the politica langle of some of his lyrics Recently Mr. Guerra took a very unfortunate turn towrads ""Christian merengue"" which I found objectionable and of lower musical quality moreover Mercifully, this new album is just love songs, free of politics and religion (as fa ras I can tell - I am not a fluent Spanish speaker) - and it is a real winner While it may not quite have the unique rustic  charm of his greatest work, it is, on the hand, more modern and accessible, his technical singing abilities have matured magnificently, plust he recording quality of this CD is a big improvement over his earlier ones The firs thalf of the album includes an infectious mambo, an abolutely magnificent bachata, Qaue Me Des Tu Carino,  and the kind of high spirited salsa and merengue we associate with this artist It is similar to his old work ,but different The secodn half of the album is perhaps a bit less impressive The best here is an intriuging mellow salsa Cancioncita De Amor, and a ballad Sabia Manera in which Guerra sings more beautifully than I have ever heard him On the basis of this one song alone, I would say Guerra has th efinest male voice in Latin music today hTe other songs in the second half are fine, but relatively conventional compared to the rest of the album Plus the title tune, La Llave de mi Corazon is a staright repeat of Medicine for My Soul, but in Spanish The Final ""bonus"" song A La Vera is baeutiful, but abbreviated I woudl not say La Llave de mi Corazon surpasses Guerra's best work of the 80s and the 90s , but that is really not important It is good to see that Mr. Guerra has come up with an album  that retains much of what has made him so great, but without repeating himself With all th edreary music being released today, that La Llave de Mi Corazon should get a ""Best Album"" award is a no-brainer"
<NULL> I bought this CD based on reviews so I want to add that this i sone of my favorite CD's and I am NOT latin I spaek passable Spanish but this music transcends words 'Im into Latin dancing and there are some great dance cuts here But the romantics ongs just carry me away

"<NULL> I ordered this album as I am a big fan of the ebach boys and was curious as to what hidden treasures Mr Love may have had on offer As usual the service from Amazon wsa excellent and the package arrived on time As it was a little too wide to fit through the letterbox I hadt o sign for it The delivery guy did not look well, his brow was sweaty, his breathing heavy and hi smovement somewhat laboured After I signed he stumble daway and seemed to keep repeating the words 'the worst of times Anyway, I went back inside, opened the packaging, sa a side note when I opened the package a gust of air that smelled very much like sulphur, filled my nostrils and I swear I heard a noise that sounded like 312 people in a casino lounge groaning in pain Upon reading the track listingo n the sleeve I was very disappointed that Mr Love has only one co writing credit on an album containing 10 songs I can only assume he was svaing his best stuff for the beach boys Him bring the primary, adn extraordinarily talented, lyricist of the group Anyways, I put the record on the turntable, put the needle down and heard that wonderful pop and buzz as hte record was about to start The opening line of the title track 'looking back with love' set the tone for the whole album, a omst gruesome violation of the eardrums Mikes nasally voice singing lyrics made up of song titles, cultural ndos & the obligatory use of the word 'excitations While that song should have been enough to put me off listening to the rest of the albumI  decided to persevere Turns out Im' something of a madochist With each song, or rather nasally dirge, the listening experience became something of an ordeal and the song 'rocking the man in the boat'  Ifound particularly disturbing given it is subject matter of activities that should not be discussed outside of the bedroom This was made worse by the fact I could picture miek love in one of his signature creepy poses moving ever closer to me, yet still I persevered By the time I reached 'paradise found' the final track on the record, I felt nauseous, slightly disturbed and very angry at myself for wasting almost fou rEnglish pounds on that drivel As soon as the final song finished I leapt from my seat ands topped the record immediately out of fear that there may be hidden bonus tracks In disgust I took the album out to the yard, placed it on my barbecue and set the 12 inches of evil akight and the strangest thing happened, the flames burned green and an awful noise that sounded like an old man with rhiintis saying 'WHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENN' for about a minute I would not recommned this album to anyone Listening to itw as a very uncomfortable experience and made me want to shove hot knitting needles in my ears I am very disappointed that I am obliged to give thi salbum a minimum score of one star I should have eben paid for listening to it Yours

"<NULL> There seems to be a bit of a tug-o-war between fans who have bought the originals, re-issues and re-re-issues and those who mark the rer-e-re-issue as something noteworthy I fall into the former category and find thati t makes sense (from Costello's accountants' point of view) and does not make sense (from the point of view of any consumer who already owns three copies of ""Tokyo Storm Warning Personally, I will wait until the Starbucks re-r-ere-re-issue in 2010"
"<NULL> Tihs is 5 star music But it has already been reissued, many times In my opinion (and I believe, in any Costello-fan opinion), the

full CD of unreleased, b-side, alternat,e live, demo takes, sometimes

even better than the original material Very little (i fany of that extra material seems to be issued in htis box set If you love Costello's music, then the 2-CD reissue is the right place to

"<NULL> This album is absolutely the crown of everything good that the 80's rock bansd aspired to in terms of energy and attitude The first six songs- Shotgun Sally, Nine Lives, Her Monkey, Whip it Out, Long WayF rom Home and Coast to Coast- are top notch high tempo, face-ripping hard rock, dripping raw energy and sleaze despite the ultra polished production The album's one ""eh"" point is next with the custoamry ballad ""Every Sunrise"", a few steps above the typical vomit-inducing dreck of the day like Warrant's ""Heaven"", but still little more than breathing room before picking up again with the funkier mid-tempo ""Evil Angel"" and ""Bad Boys are Back""(great song despite the cringeworthy title), then sprinting to the finish with high speed closer ""Heaven on a Heartbeat Isi t deep Of coruse not, it is 1989 But if you want to push the envelope beyond Poison and Wrarant and the like, without going full-on metal, take a listen to this band....and do not blame me for the speeding ticket"
"<NULL> Cats In Boots yet another hard rcok/glam band that did not have enough time to mature The album is sleazy and dripping with testosterone wrapped u pin silk scarves & spandex Honestly they were anothe rHanoi Rocks influenced band that was not quite there yet With time they oculd have been Her Mokney was an ok song along with Shotgun Sally after that its pretty much junk glam metal If you enjoy sleezy, thin rock with light weight production thsi is for you It is not the worst album of the genre but no where near hte best either"
<NULL> aftre 40 years this album is released on CD I have all of the albums on LP and hope they will also release the mon CD

<NULL> It is nice music but was not like the anointed  Worship Music I hoped it to be
<NULL> iddn't like the live version
"<NULL> I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overrwought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation I eprsonally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way agian Both of these recordings are looking back from a place fo acceptance and reflection Ms. Voegele has recorded a version which captures what it feels like to have just lost that olve and the wounds have not had time to scab over Like Job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just, nor iss he willing to ""curse God and die"
"<NULL> Beautiful song, mediocre rendiiton The Amazon preview did not include either the weak chat at the beginnin gor the applause at the end, either of which is OK for one listen but gets old quick Separate from that, form y taste there are better versions available I just bought the wrong noe"

"<NULL> This isa  song that I heard as a ""golden oldie"" when I first listened to rock and roll in the early sixties It has a haunting melody, an dI still like it This recording is in stereo, though the fidelity is not all it could have been,e ven at the time Said to have been released in 1959, it is probably rechanneled for stereo from a mono orgiinal Contrayr to a popular myth, ""Sleepwalk"" by Ultravox is NOT a cover of this song T(hat's a joke"
