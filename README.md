# Second Year Project
# Introduction to Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning

This repository contains the work for a three phase project in Natural Language Processing. Phase 1 is the development of an NLP model for the purpose of sentiment classification of Amazon music reviews. Stage 2 involved creating edge cases that would challenge the model that was employed in stage one, as well as the predictions of these hard cases. Stage 3 involves a novel study related to sentiment analysis in a cross-domain setting.
